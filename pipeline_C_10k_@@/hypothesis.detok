Cam Auer wanted to repair her sex, diagnosis and now he is making the art on the subject - 'people should have the right to their own bodies'.
Tens of patient reports are being disappeared from the disappearance of Project room-galleries in Kukosarea.
Each of them reads the name of Cam Auer.
Paper reveals a multi-annual story of the way in which people outside have written their overinterpretation of Auerta and this identity.
On his behalf, he has decided who he is.
'I wanted to express my personal therapeutic history in order to make the violence of the process visible ', Mrs Auer says.
By means of this process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long-term research period involving meetings with psychologists, psychologists, therapies and doctors.
The process is beginning to start to start with the 'cydiagnosis' of gender identity, which will take place in Tampere and Helsinki.
As far as Mrs Auer is concerned, the process began four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the estropical gene that he had been carrying out through the Internet and had in any other way been very long in his own process of repairing.
He seemed to be a woman, but under the Finnish law, someone must go through the process of repairing the sexes in order to be able to correct the gender legally.
The Trans law, that is to say the law on the strengthening of the gender of tranchovy (563 / 2002), obliges people of transit sex to compulsory repatriation in order, for example, to get the right sex into the demographic register and passport.
At present, psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability are required of each sex.
It is the right of people to decide their own bodies.
'The situation is intolerable and violates human rights' says Auer.
We have been talking about reform of the Trans Code in Finland for a long time.
Eight observations have been made by the UN Human Rights Council and the wonderful European Criminal Court is a precedent which obliges the parties to the Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the then Minister for Social and Health, Susanne Husanov.
Elections took place and the Peruvian people came to the government.
Now, the change of law is again on the table.
These are internal political disputes that do not even relate to this legislation.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law" says Frank Josson, the head of the Director-General of the Supreme of Finland.
Two major installations are dominated by the interests of the state of affairs.
One of them is the packaging and instruction of medicinal products used by Mrs Auer.
In the Points Installation, any watchword can read, for example, the psychological interpretation of the University hospital in Tampere from Auera.
Psychologist met Camil Auerr twice and wrote a report which should be defined in terms of access to Auer's justice and access to aid.
The collapse of the reality that is being examined seems to be at risk of undermining.
The perception that is being examined seems to be fragmented in a cross-border fashion and the instability of the personality is highlighted.
Mrs Auer did not recognise these descriptions.
'It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosis as a happy sick ', Auer says.
It was even more shocking that gender remedies were not granted to Mrs Auerta.
According to the therapeutic staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then on 11 February 2015 - and Auer went out of the meeting and put the tranche on television.
Subsequently, this television created the art of the name 'Monutual for the Exlud', where Auer flout his experience of power and its use.
'It is mad that anyone who is being born as a woman can grow up their feet, but it needs a diagnosis, Mrs Auer.
Mr Kehosovai is not your own if the homes were anything but a gender quantity.
Unfortunately, Mrs Auer's experience is not the only one.
For many spiritual reasons, the process of repairing is more tough than for purely medical operations.
There are dozens of people who need to be justified and entitled to their own gender experience.
"It is mad that people who need support and assistance should be denied access to treatment, calling for their resources to be insufficient", Mrs Auer says.
Many people who have applied to the process have a psychological doctrine: Housing, harassment, possible experiences of harassment.
In this respect, the treatment staff cannot prescribe that treatment cannot start.
"Preventing treatment and assistance can eat people even worse than it was before the start of the process", Mrs Auer says.
Mrs Auer 's personal exhibition also deals with harassment and ideas about suicide.
Mrs Auer wrote in her text: 'I have had self-destructive ideas throughout my adult age and that is usually difficult for people to close'.
Masses have been treated with medicinal products and when Mrs Auer started using hormones, it has been easier.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenaging.
The reason why the sleep did not appear to be suitable for its own body and why the beef had to be a cycle instead of a fair bread.
The most important thing to Mrs Auerta has been that there are people who see her.
One of the fundamental needs to be seen.
'As you have to justify yourself by talking, falling, voting and moving ', he says so much.
Today, Mrs Auer already feels she is going to be one, she is a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the near coincidental comments were able to get a lot of light.
It is the case that close relatives are most sexually sex.
"They should know and know who I am but do not agree or cannot internalise," he will continue.
However, not all transit people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from physical sforth, that is to say from a confusion in which the body or parts can cause harassment and even physical harassment.
Without the use of hormones and a long investigation process, however, it cannot be formally confirmed to its own sex.
"There is no medical justification for these studies", Mrs Auer says.
And that is true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the legal recognition of the new sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in legal matters.
A full-time applicant is making a written application for a new identity card, stating that he feels that he is another sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will give the applicant a new identity card.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland, and Auer's exhibition is also accompanied by this requirement.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but a political and artistic team.
I would like to believe that art still has a weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The civil law organisation issued a travel warning to Mr Missourourmas.
The National NACPCP has issued a travel warning against Missourourouroura, because of discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the Länder.
The 'NACPC's travel information on Missourouroura' will enter into force from 28 to 8.2017 and calls for special attention and extreme caution when travelling in a federal state where a number of dubious racial events have taken place recently 'is stated by the organisation'.
The recent law in Misski makes exports of discrimination more difficult and disproportionately affected minorities, according to NAACP, these factors led to travel warnings.
"Human rights are being violated.
They are being interrupted on the basis of colour and abuses or killed ', Mr Rod, President of the NAAACPC Missourourmas, said in the United Nations City Star.
"We have not heard so many cases in just as little time."
The travel information on Miss is the first warning from the organisation of the United States of America.
The organisation referred, for example, to the racist comments on the University of Missourski and the death of the 28th-year black Tory Sanderson from Tokyry.
Mrs Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year and she was driving through the Länder when she left her car with fuel, who was arrested by the Misski police, even though she was not accused of a crime.
The communication also referred to the report by the Minister for Justice, Mr Misski, according to which the police are more likely to stop the black driver by 75% than the white.
'The purpose of this communication is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Misski ', Mr Chapel says.
"People must be prepared, for example, by including money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the Länder".
According to the FBI, in 2015, a hundred thousand offences were recorded in Misski, that is, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The warning is also a response to the new Misski law, which makes it more difficult to challenge companies to justice in the field of housing and employment.
The ACLUU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after adopting immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for crimes of immigration, which, according to the organisation, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the foreign minister, and they concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Mrs J. Linkohr has asked for an account to be made of the supplementary retirement provision of the Director-General for Donors.
The Minister for External Trade, Mika Linkohr, who is responsible for State ownership, has asked Mr Finnair for an inquiry into the supplementary pension fee received by Mr Pekka Vauramo, to report.
According to the Minister, this is in conflict with state will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 in Vauramo was raised this week, when the Helsinki words revealed the development of the reward of the heads of the stock exchange.
The Finnish newspaper revealed Vaurmo's supplementary retirement in February.
Finnair reported that he would abandon supplementary pensions by 2013.
The State has agreed that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The State owns more than half of the Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision in principle on ownership.
The sanctions were tightened up immediately.
Until recently, it seemed as if relations between the United States and Russia were travelling from cold to heart.
The United States President Donald Trump and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, met in Hamburg, seemed to be working well with each other.
Since then, the tunnel has fallen considerably.
Russian reaction to the new economic sanctions agreed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trushkukistan on Wednesday was cyclical.
The most robust answer has so far been to hear Prime Minister Dmitri Medknez say that the sanctions code signed by Trushi represents a 'full trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were only to be a matter of political rhetoric and excesses, the escalation between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short post-Trush month.
In the United States, the proximity of the code of sanctions for Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
Admittedly, the Congress adopted the law with substantial unanimity, but, as we have been told, it was considerably more difficult for the President to adopt it.
Mr Trumump criticises the law he has recently signed as' significant shortcomings'.
In particular, Russia has been the cause of President Trukumpi 's rush, although it has also had to be repugnant to adopt a law that restricts its own powers.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States of America of the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections and of the links between the Trushi campaign.
The blackmail between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of discipline.
Once the staff of the Belorussian House have revealed tight and different scandalous translations almost to update, it is becoming increasingly apparent that foreign policy is not being done under the leadership of the President of the United States, but despite the President.
This is certainly not a desirable situation.
If Russia is a stimulus in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also the tense security situation in the core area of the Union in the Baltic Sea is exacerbating relations.
The EU has clearly outlined the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united on at least the main aspects of its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are very different.
For a country such as Finland, a country that is very trading with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real blockade.
The effects of the recent American code of sanctions are still vague.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects could be felt in the Nord Stream 2 housing project and possibly in the Feyso nuclear power station project.
Europe has caused the exclusion of a livestock which is important for the American economy, for example, LNG.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing contempt in world politics.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well thought out and monitored.
Otherwise, they will be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacrosanct?
The white House of Trushi now has a Vapaudantine in its aim.
Interference in Patsatsos is the safest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as others: The Iraqi people, together with the American soldiers, disappeared on Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdov in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main philosophies of the Trushi Administration, knew very well what was being done in the heated debate with CNN, Jim Acos, who was attacked by Mr Miller 's verbatim report on the President' s proposal to considerably reduce legal immigration.
Mr Miller did not actually criticise the statute itself.
If he had done so, he would have obtained massive squabbles from the organisers of the teachers and the massive queries of the Vapudaudane.
His attack was about the importance of the statute and, in particular, about the fact that in 1903, Emma Lazarn was added to his footsteps - 17 years after his statute was completed.
I saw Accer, 'I do not want to go into history any further, but Vapaudaudence... is a symbol of American freedom, which is enlightened throughout the world.
It was subsequently added, and it is not part of the original Vapaudane. "
Mr Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just a history, as he himself said.
The essential thing is the words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state is invited not only to immigrants but to 'the poorest': 'Easything, Easything but also to the poorest'.
It is now more topical than ever.
Mr Miller did not make any criticism of literature: He made it clear that 'the poorest' are not welcome to the United States of Trushi.
The controversy over the importance of the Vapaudaudauditor is part of a wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his death, the friends of Lazarus campaigned for a hull to be put on their statues, well aware that it was a strong political act.
The purpose of the statue was to reflect the links between French and American republics with a classic symbolic, a woman of freedom.
Mr Lazarus changed its significance: In his hole the female hemicycle is no longer abstract but has a voice.
It gives itself a new name: The expelled mother.
Annexing Ru to the image was a nonsensical feminist coup and a disastrous attack on the American nationalism.
Mr Lazarus changed the meaning of his statute and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh - an anger that can now be regarded as some sort of forecast of Trumphi - claimed in 2010 that the Vaudaudaudence did not prevent anyone from inviting anybody, it is an early pioneer of the new Conservatives who takes the blind eye of the United States to hide the world: 'Libert will come to light.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The blind is not the way to the United States. "
Rarely, Limbaugh was right in part.
The importance of the auditing statute depends entirely on the point.
Lazarus has seen the poor and flourishing but hopeful migrants from the ship after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for protection and better life.
His Vapaudaudauditor is comfortable by giving hope and welcoming.
Mr Miller and Mr Trump do not want that at all.
Their belligerence is not the way to go, it is a flights of hatred, their only force.
MMMMs of Sport 2017: Neil Black praises the British Majesty Scots.
Ethgh Doyle recalls the time when only two scots arrived in the British landscape.
Neil Black, the leader of the British General Sport Association, says that the sixteen Scottish members of the scoreboard participating in the World Cup are 'significant confirmation'.
On Friday, a number of Scottish sportsmen and women have been elected to open the MMMMs of Sports in London.
According to Mr Blak, in Scotland, 'something special' is happening, which Great Britain must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to investigate it for so long as we understand what it is about" Mr Black says.
'I spoke with the representatives of the Scottish sporting institution and they thought it was related to the work of the institution.
The Scottish General Sports Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is linked to the operation of the Alliance;
And the British General Sports Federation believes that it is their business.
And the ordinary cabinet thinks he should have something to do with this.
However, this is something quite magnificent, for which reason it is due. "
Many Scottish athletes compete seriously in London with the mines, including Lura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing with Sir Mo Farahim five thousand metres in the chain, and Eardh Doyle was chosen as the rebel of the machine.
'Ethidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful ', Mr Black says.
"Sportsmen and women have missed the opportunity to be proud of their achievements and very motivated, irrespective of where they live and practise.
There was a genuine feeling and passion in the words of Ethiard in sport. "
He thinks it is' incredible 'to have sixteen scores in the sky in the sky.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 to 2015.
In the course of a year, Lura Muir has been drinking five British and two European record rooms.
He competes in London with 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare drink 1 500 metres in London, and it is worth bearing in mind that the man has an excellent period with the profits of the British Mexico and the Annimal Games.
Mrs Doyle recalls her first world championship, when the sky was Le McConnell.
The captain of the sweetener says that it is' extremely proud 'that there are so many scores, some of which are serious about competing with bankruptcies and mines.
'Access to Capes is a great honour, but, more importantly, it is because the Members of the Majesty voted the captain ', Mrs Doyle, says.
'I am, of course, very proud of all the scores that came to the sleep.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as well-placed sportsmen and women who compete with prizes.
I revolved?
I think that was very well done.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have homes.
It is important to enjoy the support of the domestic public and to be again in the Olympic stadium.
I have another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be absurd '.
Preventing critics in Facebo: Maternity is conditional on public service if you do not tolerate criticism.
The father of our country knew what is bad publicity.
The Americans love George Washington, but the newspapers soon started to criticise him for any domestic policy, always on his political principles.
Criticism has certainly taken a step backwards;
But he did not silence his critics.
'Washington said in 1783 that if freedom of speech is abolished, we may be stupid and silent.
That brings us to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should learn lessons from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Faceban website and prevented their authors.
Earlier this week, the American Civil Rights Association brought Hogan to justice.
His staff consider the challenge to be unfounded, and the approach to the network was also insignificant.
'What is it just Facebok ', many comments?
But it is important;
Particularly with Hogan.
Hogan is an amazing Länder governed by democrats.
Secondly, he has obtained the best assessments of his activities among 50 Governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive response to the hot spot.
He has led the federal state firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebo as the main contact channel to his constituents and published a picture of the vicinity of the chemicals.
That is why preventing users coming to the Facebo web site is unnecessary and even dangerous, and the Governor's web site is a public and official forum which his staff maintain with tax resources.
The Hogan scientist, Amelia Chaski, argued for the Governor's actions in his interview with Washington 's postal service, who said that it was only a matter of discrepancy between comments.
It is, however, too easy to identify the participants as troika, slide or hatred.
Washington Post challenged users at Facebok in Hogan.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, not tropical but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pyres.
They told us that their comments were respectable, noticeable and appropriate.
He quoted his comments as Ramallo; he wanted to appeal to Hogan Catholic faith.
The lawyer Laxhm Sarmadi Rami Maryland Bowis was not hostile but asked a question about the crimes of hatred.
'I would like to comment warmly on my disappointment that Mrs Hogan had not adopted a position on hate crimes and other recent news' in her comments on Washington Posselt's news.
'I am also unable to accept the fact that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be an organised group in some way and ignore the citizens concerned as a large group '.
The Governor 's staff called comments' centralised aggression '.
Even in the age of Faceb, communication is easy to manage by preventing a criticist or by removing a critical comment.
In the past, the staff should have been sent to collect and incinerate newspapers in which critical protocols had been published, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it is really the same thing, now only in digital terms.
Hogan is not the first public village accused of dumping by Facebo and other social media channels.
He has been brought to justice by the Truster users who blocked President Trush.
A first important decision was taken on the subject last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacherierieds, the government of the Loudow constituency of Alexandrou breached the first increase in the American Constitution by preventing the electorate from being in Facebo.
And the American Civil Rights Association visited the debate with its Governor, Matt Beat, Twietre and Facebo.
This should not be difficult.
Cheap postal charges at Washington had the same effect as they are now on the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased from 1776 to 1800 years, and anonymous authors shocked Washington.
We had troika back then.
The signs of Jurica, Vallelersundi, Belisarius and Port wrote letters in newspapers in which they drew up the decisions of Washington.
Appeals were made to the President 's office to criticise the Jau Agreement, the agreement on cooperation, trade and sea between the United States and Britain, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
It is necessary to put an end to the summer fattening of birds immediately.
The samples have come from approximately ten places and, furthermore, net notifications of two or three.
Most of them have come from Eastern and Vartiwomen in Finland, but then the individual Haapapur and Seika, the specialist scientist, Marie and Great Britain, are telling us of Estonia.
Oxides have died from the nitrosoft disease.
It is the original life of its scientific name, Trichomovonnas gallery.
In the past, it has been known to be attacking villages, and in particular the gap.
However, the disease was also detected in software in the 2000s.
In 2009, the jungle was very good.
At the time, the sulphur crash in Finland resulted in the collapse of the green husbandry and since then the stocks of species have been reversed.
There have now been the sick green phones, but not, at least on a large scale, the museums of Juhna Honktasa, the natural centrepiece of the University of Helsinki.
It is to be feared that the previous outbreak of green phones will be renewed unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: To put an end to the cultivation of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Roran Raferfert hopes to benefit from the homework of Reazen Club.
The former European club player, Ronan Raferce, hopes to benefit from domestic representation over the next three days, when the Renavy Club Club Club Club in Austria is organising 25 Scotland's Senior Opean accident.
Last year, the Northern Irish Raference led the cowardice organised in neighbouring Archerry Linkens before the last round, but finally disappeared to Paul Ealaysia.
'I followed the construction of Renault Club, and this event will allow it to get full of loyalty ', as Rafert says.
"Players see the field at their best, and that is wonderful.
Mr Jerry has done sterling work with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador to the game and he is proud of his work here.
Peat is a wonderful presentation opportunity in this field. "
For the first time, the English Ell is defending the musterity of the mysterious, although it has won its 32th anniversary in both the circulation of Europe and the fragmentation of Europe.
"This seems to be a very special opportunity," the player living in SouthPortuguese says.
'I did not succeed in defending Extremadura Opel's victory, because peat is not part of the controversy this year.
It is wonderful to return here.
This is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year are remembering that I and my wife, Mr Sharon, had a wonderful victory.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember '.
Mr Gary Orr is returning to reality on his own soil, who, having been filled for 50 years earlier this year, has taken part in the struggle.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since 2013 in the Aberdan Management School.
'It is always more relevant ', as Mr Orr says.
"You want to succeed, but you are also familiar with extra pressure.
I have once again enjoyed intimidation and have played a rather strong role.
I am pleased with this game so far. "
The triangle is to be followed by the former Masterster winner Ian Wootssom and Senior Mayor, Paul Broadhurdami, Roger Chah, Mark Jamal and Mark McNululut.
Six scores are involved: Orr and the former Ryder Cup revolt Sam Torraence and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAiller, Bill Longmuir and Rosss Drumond.

In the village, the potential internal problems of the plane were clarified.
In the village, there have been no internal air problems, at least for the time being, on Thursday, of the Red Cross.
Aviation studies are still being carried on.
The investigations began when the man who interrupted his security services for health reasons believed that his health had deteriorated due to the absence of a greenhouse house house house.
According to Mika Holman, the Head of the Prika of Red Cross, there have been no problems with the health of other shipowners.
It became apparent that this was a specific case and that other salaries in that unit had no health problems.
Every notice is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Mr Holmes says.
The Red Cross report says that, because of the arrival of July, it has had to be transferred to the plant, which has meant that it has been possible to grow in a moment.
The aircraft have therefore been able to appear emotional, Mr Holmes.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's corner country
Baradin Degegei is not used in his food.
He too is rarely used.
Degegei lives in the wood building in Enazi, in the capital of the Pania region, which is located in Indonesia's unrest province of Papua, where he prepares the day, he usually places a batch - locally "- directly with his brothers.
In half an hour 's time, the bans of the bar, who returned to the caricature, were bought hard to eat in the hands of the firewest, the most pessimistic.
There are no bad fish in Degel, and he is sitting in another landscape where he usually manages his daily expulsion, as in the case of a soft swimming near the swimming.
The postal service is supplied by a mother in a disappearance room.
Degel is the four wives of his young man and has not been prescribed to treat the fears.
Pluralism is widespread here.
Late work may be dangerous: The majority of men in the village are unemployed and many drinks are high, and the military must be taken into account.
"Nobody dares to walk in the village after five years," Degel says.
This is a rare frustration in the Earth of Papua, the former Dutch colonial Chancellor, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, with a controversial referendum forcing 1 026 villages to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The local Independence Movement against the Dutch Government quickly turned its hatred to the government of Jakarta, which is keeping the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering that country.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua, the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua-New Guinea.
Enatsia is an outermost and three-hour journey from the capital of the province of Jaya to Nabirer and is going to continue on a five-hour journey to the cycle of a temporary car.
There is no public transport here.
Some 19 000 inhabitants are surrounded by black houses, whose waves of towns have been plundered into scaffolding.
Few Indians have visited us, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the people of Papua Mee Pago returned Uga Tamil.
Other changes have also taken place.
'We did not have these clothes', Mr Degegel says, 'he means colouring, walking up a downward price, swimming a thousand people and a church in his pocket'.
'We only had a newspapers to hide our windows'.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the cornerstone of Indonesia.
Pania is the whole of the New Jerusalem, with 153 000 inhabitants, just about 100 km away from Pania, is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold, owned by the Free McMoran company, which is located in the United States.
In 2015, the mining brought USD 3.1 billion to Freeland the value of gold and flowers.
Furthermore, Papua is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these wealth for the Papuans is a source of misery, which means the presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, New York Times revealed that the Freefs paid almost USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1988 and 2004.
The demands of Papua for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 priests, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the Holiness of Papua in the 1970s gave rise to massive genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
The report by the Briscay of Archbishop, We will Everything from 2016, contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electronic attacks are particularly popular tools - and irregular attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harson, the Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The congestion has been tightened up when the natural resources of Papua attract walls from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of province are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as the Indonesian colourful colour Javan, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi is changing Muslims in the hope of a better living.
The jungle beans sell fat and plastic vegetables in the soil nutshell.
It is difficult for local people to compete.
"Mugabe has begun to sell chickens and vegetables more cheaply than local" tells the 24th anniversary Abeth You, from Pania, who has changed to the capital of the province in the course of the work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Either the President of Indonesia, Mr Widootdo - Jokowi, name names - promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address the injustices and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former pump won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on its journey to the President of Jakarta.
However, little has changed in Papua and local people feel disappointed.
'We knew our hearts because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to meet our wishes and restore justice ', Mr You says.
Pania was experienced only two months after Jokowin's loyal officials.
Eleven children were on the brink of Christmas walls in Enatina from 7.1214 to 7 June 2014 when two Indian soldiers appeared in the motorcycle.
Alarming children told the soldiers that they should use driving light.
One of the soldiers did not have a comment: According to Yawake Tebai, the man returned to four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses' reports, children were caught and ill-treated by soldiers who were drinking with fanaticism.
In this way, one of the soldiers shooting children.
One of the children, Yulimus Yeimo Yeimo, was forced to confront as a result of maltreatment.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission, which was located near the event, was set in motion and the following day it began.
Approximately a thousand priests - young men and women and children - met at football level to demand justice from the local police station and the Deputy Centre of the military.
They had hunting bids for solvents for celebrations and started to present the traditional watchword of the Papua Mee Pago tribal in which they were squandering and tracking the birds.
Some of the demonstrators started to stone the police and army buildings.
When I heard the tunnel, the soldiers were given the impression in the internal radio system: 'If the troops were doing more than three times, shooting them to death', based on the TIME 's official document which has not been published in the local media.
Yeremis Kaya, 56, the leader of the Kego region, knew that the situation had got out of hand and asked the population to reassure and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen again.
"When I turned around, I was shot in a semantic rhetoric," he told the TIME of his swine fever that had been subjected to church.
We still do not know who was shooting him, but he was created by the military.
"A number of players were shot in the emotion."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times: His Serbs saw shells.
'I went to him and ensured that it was indeed he ', said to You TIME that he was saddened, and, like many Indians, he uses just one name.
"He had died..."
The Papua police police surveiller, Jote Mende, told journalists that the police only 'protected' the police position 'because it was an attack.
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us', Pudy Suliyo, the spokesman of the Papua police, said in 2015.
"Then it is life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many injured.
The following day the information was borne out by the sadness of Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Mr Jokowi made an emotional speech in Jaya to express his sympathy with the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua will be tackled.
'I want to see an immediate investigation of the case so that it never happens again '.
In October 2016, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Wirant, said that he would initiate investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he began to withdraw his speeches straight away.
"Most of the offences occurred a long time ago;
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have chosen to investigate infringements, but to do so we need certain processes', he said.
In an interview of the TIME in Jakarta between 5 and 6.2017, the Wirer had already changed his mind and said that he was not going to begin investigations in Papua.
'everything will be clarified in court ', he said.
The UN is accusing Wirdu of 'crimes against humanity', involving the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody vote on Austria-Timor in 1999, and the Willy said in the TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been clarified, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania are unbelievable.
'I have been challenged four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way ', Mr Yoannes tells me.
"I have already tired of this."
He says that he is still afraid of this, even though it has been going on for years.
'yes, I am afraid ', he says.
'I am afraid that the army will arrest me, and I am afraid I will be shot '.
His brother, Mr Yacobus, confirms that the Spaniards do not dare to discuss this.
He tells us that he had been ill-treated by the soldiers who had helped to threaten four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victims", he says.
The Amina has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villages in the neighbouring region of Panilla in Deyan.
One died and 17 injured in the conflict between villages and the leader of the building company, which began when the leader refused to take the man who lost his way to hospital, including children.
The man who had been in need of hospital care was 24th-year-old, Ravian Douw, who had to be caught on the flight of water and died on his way to hospital.
The villages who came out of the building ground showed themselves before the company's office.
According to the police, the villages stoned police officers who responded with warnings.
According to the local authorities, however, the Indonesian paramilitaries police unit opened the way towards a force of colours, with one village killed.
'We are horror: 'We fear revenge', say the 29th anniversary of Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the vulnerable were brought to treatment.
'I have hidden home for two days'.
The Deiyan Parliament has called for police officers shooting shootings to account and for the withdrawal of the mobile police service.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real progress is feeding dissatisfaction in the Mecires, Monti, Dakar and Damalalia, who live in Papua's Holy West.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Pope with random attacks and the kidnapping of the troops of the Indonesian army.
Some of the leaders of the OPF are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and arbitrarily imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the arrests will never return.
Pania is known as' a sad, forgotten place 'among the Pope.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
There are few rice sold in Enaysia, and that too is expensive for the local authorities;
As is the case.
People grow their food for themselves: Mainly bans and some fruits and newspapers.
Farming is the work of women and one woman can have four or five bar savings.
Most of the hundreds are to be found in the family, and the rest is sold on the door.
Ten bathers only cost 10 000 corruptions (75 cents).
In time, disparities in the livelihoods of local and immigrant people have grown and the number of immigrants has risen since new routes have been opened at Nabi airport.
There are few jobs and usually they go to more trained and well-off migrants.
Few Pope people have enough capital and know-how to plunder their own companies in a competitive way.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here" says to Pania, Mr John Gobai.
The peripheral Papua is being ignored in the world.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international news are still tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escepdie and Basque Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though a few permits had been granted to them, with the official consequence of the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Asian Deputy Asian Deputy Human Rights Watch, Phelm Ked Jokowi has not kept his electoral pledges; he has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by abolishing the restrictions on renewal.
"Indonesia's most alarming eastern province of Papua and West Papua have new risks: Refusal of visas and black lists", as Mr Kithiei said in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government will only be pressurised by neighbouring Papua.
In March, six countries of the Pacific Sea - Tonga, laughter, Palau, Tuku, Marshall and the Somomomomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread infringements of Papua, including amputation in Pania.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua liberation movement.
The Indonesian foreign minister, Arrmanthatha Nasir, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that 'Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights violations'.
Local governments in the external States want to intervene.
When the official delegation from Holland led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Lanbai visited Jaya from 4 to 5.17, the local people broke silence and expressed their desire for freedom, tells us that they have taken part as an anonymous departure.
Indonesia has presidential elections of 2019, but the Pope tells us that Jokowi will probably no longer vote.
'Yokowi is a good thing, but there are people around him who are confused with the Pania amputation ', Mr Gobai, the President-in-Office of the Council.
He wants Mr Jokowin to know the situation of the Iranians: They live under the power of the greedy and unpredictable army in poverty, virtually without healthcare and education.
According to Gobi, the Iranians, like other Pashtuns, regard their votes to Jokowin as' debt ', which must be repaid.
"They do not want money; they simply want justice," he says.
Despite the intimidation and intimidation of the victims of the amputation of Pania, the relatives of the victims demonstrated once again in symbolic terms their resistance: They were threatening one of the victims to a country which is anti-police and military.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
'my Permanent Member was killed ', Mr Yacobus says he will end up under pressure.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chitjano is shaped by Robert Chika for withdrawal from the temptation of Helsinki: 'Even their own fans do not want to see'.
On 27 May, Robert Helsinki and Dereck Chikhikhi were meant to be present in Hartwalli.
However, for commercial reasons, the complaint was cancelled.
In a recent interview with the IFL TV, Chivil is throwing the blame completely into Helsinki.
In Finland, I drew up a poppy, but that was not my fault.
I am not in Finland, I do not want to sell flags there.
That was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans do not want to see him watching him because he is appalling, Mr Chika is daughter.
Helsinki and Chika for the first time in a full architecture of Hartwah in December 2011.
Helsinki won the match with a controversial core sentence.
The sale of the sale of sludge fought smoothly and its provocator, Nisse Saerland, told Mrs Iltalia in May that the match had been postponed until autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
Withdrawal, however, will no longer deplore Chika.
After all, it would probably have been necessary to cancel the match after Chikhi.
On Thursday, three days before the match date, I had a lot of friction.
I was exploded with explosives.
In the hospital, it was said that I should be cut, Mr Chi tells me.
The British state that they are in order at present at around 45.5%.
From all points of view, he is not interested in a reinvigoration with Helsinki, but in Dillia Walte.
Chika suffered a loss in Whytsant in December.
The power of the Tochchell cloud in Dubai once again came to power.
On Friday, hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee from a high 79th-floor building.
This was the second fire within two years of a building called Torch.
The building was withdrawn and nobody knows that it was injured, and for the sake of fire, there was no idea immediately after the event.
'We were sleeping and woke up a fire alarm and people's auctions.
The inhabitants of Georgia told Reuterster about the 50th floor, which took ten minutes'.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the exhaustion forces were allowed to arrive at four local times this morning and left the building in the pipeline.
The government announced that it would organise accommodation for those who have left their homes.
The case may arise again about the safety of high-quality materials in external fields across the world.
Following the fires of 2015, the Executive Board of the Tochchell building commissioned a study which made it clear that the most damaged are the people who have been used to hit and isolate their headquarters.
In Great Britain, the police believe that Grenfell Towerk 's resignation and accounting circles in London could contribute to the rapid advance of solvents in a fire in which 80 people died in June.
A mopolecular park was stolen at night.
A mopolecular park was stolen between midnight 21 and Wednesday 5.
Mr Mokyo disappeared from the demonstration of the risk of Nice No 2.
Mr Mokyo was at the forefront of Sky Team Monku.
It is red, and the registration is 277-REV.
Later on Thursday, Mokyo was found.
This e-mail address is protected from scandals by the police.
Tark Japus Scrit has seen a police updating of the number of 95 415 320.
The formulated at 3.8.20 p.m., at 12.40 p.m: The police informed us that moping had been found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers are involved in the plane, revealing an questionnaire.
A survey carried out to air passengers reveals that over 20% of passengers in the United States had taken banned objects deliberately or without knowing about aircraft over the TSA inspection points, at least 6% of passengers had veiled or other steel objects that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said that they had only arrived afterwards to know that they had transported arms, shells or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the questionnaire and carried out by the Strusts Jet Charters airline, and the results also show that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules were Joint generation representatives and less than 15% belonged to the X generation.
In general, the rules were violated by exporting food and hurdles to aircraft.
More than 3% admitted that they had been exported deliberately to the aircraft on the steel, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had deliberately exported prohibited medicines to the aircraft.
A survey carried out by a company carrying out a questionnaire wished to see how many had taken smuggling goods over a security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelling passengers are also most likely to export smuggling goods over the security inspection - knowingly or without knowing.
However, as the company has done in the questionnaire says, the TSAA guidelines are very complicated and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what barriers can be exported and how many.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the majority of TSA confiscations are barriers.
There was also the belief that books should not be exported to an aircraft for some time.
Barriers must be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
The leader of the American Environmental Protection Agency, Sct Prust, robbed his decision to delay the decisions taken in Obahama to reduce emissions.
The day after the fifteen Länder had been challenged by the US Director of the EPA, Scott Prustini, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce emissions from smoke under Obau's regime.
According to Mr Prush, the change shows that the agency under his leadership will take better account of the needs of the Länder 's environmental decision-makers.
There was no mention of the position raised against his previous decision by the federal Court of Petitions.
The Länder should start to comply with the 2015 standard for earthquake ozone from 11 a.m..
In June, Mr Prust announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year onwards, so that his office will have more time to study the plan, because the agency 'does not want to interfere in local decision-making or to prevent economic growth'.
Prush was a public prosecutor of the Oklakhman State before President Donald Trump appointed him as Director of the EPA, known as opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since its revenue to Washington, Prush has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of anti-decisions by the chemical and fossil industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest step backwards for the Prustinie plan to alleviate the provisions.
Last month, a federal petition court in Washington ruled that the director of the EPA exceeded his mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce metal leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr Prust claimed that his U-turn to the ozone rules only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at fulfilling new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
'In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected the activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach agreement on timetables', Mr Prust said, and he wasted over ten times in his previous action the Environment Agency's Environment Agency's right.
'We do not believe in legal regulation and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation on our actions seriously and the powers that it gives us'.
However, the EPA 's opinion stated that Prush could continue to use its' powers to delay the implementation of decisions and its other legal powers' to ensure 'that the provisions' are justified and are based on the best available information '.
In the Congress, the Republicans are pushing for a wider change in the ozone rules.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the decisions of 2015 by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The leader of the federal coalition of the EPA this week, Eric Schneider, said that the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
'The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for the 6.7 million news people and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoking in their communities', Mr Schneider.
Not only New York, but also California, Cotte, Delawi, Illinois, Iowa, Massachips, Mexico, New Mexico, Penelulate, Rholand, Vermont, Washington and Distric of Colombia.
Earthquake ozone is born when emissions from cars, power stations, oil refineries and chemicals plants, for example, react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The scourge of this kind could cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable people, and it is partly due to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmental protection welcomed the surprising change in direction in Praille.
'It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the blood responsible for our respiratory air used common sense ', Lori Annan Burd' s Centre for Biological Diversity.
'We must continue to fight the Trushi regime because its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of polluters and other groups of self-interest '.
The automobile manufacturer is becoming a street - 'it is at the Ferrr gauge'.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time trying to maintain its ecological role.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen on Wednesday, when Mr Sergio Marchionte said that plans were being made at the information conference.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian super-car manufacturer will present his five-year plan, Autommemoique News.
All cases of devastation in Eastern San
The devastation of the Ramallah Chamber is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East San, to inform THL.
On Thursday, the laboratory of health and welfare institutes has ensured that the fifth waste outbreak of Eastern San is in line with previous infections.
THL has ensured that the devastation ensured on Friday 28 July by a Salvagant person is the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern San.
On the basis of this information, all the infections in eastern Sakharov are linked to the first disaster in the region in June.
The news is good, because that means that we have not brought forward other types of devastation virus.
It is possible, however, that, until August, new infections can be raised from the fifth-infected afterwards, and so the epidemic has not yet passed, the basic health doctor in Soster, Mitary Erkel, says.
New devastation infections or doubts have not emerged since the fifth certified case.
It is still important, however, that everyone should ensure that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date, Erkchol is reminded.
More on the subject: Three new thousand new devastation infections were identified in Pikkania - 'HIV / AIDS or epidemic are highly unlikely'.
Finland is preparing for a licensed river.
Mr Pontone's invention was not even considered legal.
Against the backdrop of the argument that the process, alongside wine, produces a molluscs which is toxic.
Manufacture at home will be legal next year, but the legalisation of the pony is not even considered.
The chickens are manufactured by means of use, by the back door.
Underlying the regulation of the Tiseach is based on the argument that the process, alongside wine, produces a molluscs which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the pony as a right of occupation, a government adviser Ismo from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry drafted a reform of the alcohol law, it was not considered legal.
Nor was it on the political table.
There was no debate on liberalisation, Mr Ouvi Miskela (Kok).
He is at the negotiating stage of the groups of government delegations who took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
In the future, there will not even be an authorisation to dispose of the pyramid at home.
Commercial production will also remain permitted.
Importing tells us that there will be a simple rule for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages: Alcohol can be produced by means of domestic use.
This means that, in addition to beer, silicone and wine, a home can legally run.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements for milk and flavouring substances and allows the manufacture of the river, Meckela, to be clarified.
The manufacture must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the milk and flavourings created in the course of their use are clearly detected.
Under the new law, drinks can be made as much as they like, and self-employed alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must not continue to be marketed.
In Finland, there is no longer a public health problem, and that is the belief.
Much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alyssance law comes before the House as soon as the cycle starts.
The plenary is 5.9 p.m.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the delegation had already adopted a position, and Meckela is delighted.
Oscar Piscus was stoned with armed guards in hospital.
Oscar Piscus, who suffered from the Red Cross, was stoned to the South African hospital for suspicions of heart.
He has already left the hospital.
Oscar Piscus is in prison in Arigegean.
According to the British newspaper, Mr Mirror was taken from prison to hospital by armed guards this morning.
Mr Pistos suffered breast pages, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison scientist confirmed that he was taken to hospital.
The former top-level sportsman, for his part, said that the former top-level sportsman was in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a funeral of paralysis for six years to prison for the murder of its girl, Rev Sthenktash.
Mr Pistos shot Sthens in February 2013.
Diverse telephone conversations reveal the pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
The links between the telephone conversations between the President of the United States, Donald Trush, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been put on the post of Washington.
In the telephone conversation on 27 and 17 June, Mr Trump called on the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speeches saying that he did not intend to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States shocked Nietta that this had come down in public with a wall project, "I cannot say that to the press, Mr Trump.
Mr Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published the first telephone of Tritter to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turust, during which there was a fixed exchange of words.
Mr Trumumump said to him that the agreement that the United States would take refugees travelling to Australia was' ridiculous', 'sad' and 'stupid', according to which the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would allow him to look 'idiotic' because he had proposed a ban on residence in the United States.
Mr Trumump stopped speaking time by saying to Mr Turnbunk that 'this is the most unpleasant speech of the whole day'.
Georgia's bloodshed: Activists resisted the racist moratorium in hope.
The Ford Mercury car is overstepping the population in the small town of Monroo in the countryside of Georgia and is continuing its journey towards a small bridge of Moore Ford.
There are four black passengers and white drivers in the car; four armed men go the way before a car is in place.
A group of leader, a middle-year-old man who has fallen into the rabble of raids is taking a deep breath from his swine fever and throwing through the wind.
Passengers are afraid.
"Roger,"!
"Outside the car!"
They violate silence when a young black man is withdrawn from the front.
Fortunately, this tragic event is nothing more than a resistance from 2.717 p.m.
The loss of the shock is true, however, when the hurricane is disbanded into the 'Roger'.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have restored Moore 's Ford to the region to recover the events of 1946, when Kux Klan delayed two black parents, Roger and Dorotu Maldey and George and Mae Muray Dorsel.
Nobody has been accused of murdering.
"It is disgraceful that nobody has been arrested over the last few years - even though the murderers live amongst us and many have to know who they are" - to say Tyroyne Brook, which helps to restructure the resistance.
'It is a disgrace in history, but above all it is a burden that is weighing our soul '.
Brook is a 71st-year-old civil law activist and a former representative of Georgia Congress.
His resistance is an alarming invitation to act, and it also reminds the people of Monroo of the fact that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to see those responsible brought to justice; we want things finally to be brought to an end and we want to recover from sadness and reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Mr Brook says.
'We cannot recover and reconcile before we get justice '.
The guilty investigator conceals the bodies of the victim who died in Georgia from 27 to 7.46.
According to the news from the NBI, more than 50 men in Monroo and the surrounding sites were suspected of the delay.
But nobody was accused of murdering.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, the activists have always known the motives of the moratorium: Politics and politics.
In 1946, the black people of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential elections by the Supreme Court in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the elections in which Roger Malcom, the white land owner, Barnet Heterster, appeared to be the wife of Maltese in the toy of Dokay.
According to Broosis, it was rumoured that Helster had a relationship with Dorothyy and that Dorothy expected this child.
According to the FBI, Loy Harris, an impressive white country owner, paid USD 25.7.46 to the 600 dollars that he was released from prison.
On their home journey, Malcom and Dorotu were followed by their Serbs Mae Muray and George Dorray.
They stopped their cars before Moore Ford's bridge.
'It has become apparent that Mr Harris has replaced and organised murders', the FBI report says.
'It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the State and the local authorities, which was involved in murder and disappeared evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses'.
Mr Brook expresses this in greater depth.
"It was a voter murder" he says.
'they were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same will happen if they are to vote '.
For almost a decade, Cassadra Greenpeace has been steering resistance to the massacre in Georgia.
This is an extremely realistic and imprisoned proposal, an illustration of the appalling racism which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America.
It is difficult to look at the proposal, but it is even more difficult not to see what Greenland is meant to do.
'We do not want to talk about the delay because we would also have to face our own dark side ', the guide says'.
'but I cannot create a relationship with you if you do not hear me or do not want to hear what I have had to experience '.
On the first day, around 30 spectators - dozens of black people and dozens of white people - met to listen to the well-informed summary of the proposal from Greenland.
Wade Marbah will be the assistant of Greenland.
He has been representing the local leader of Kux Klux Klan for years, but it is always as difficult and disgusting.
"Will be dirty because I am not myself", Mr Marbag says.
'It is important, however, that this aspect of history should be raised so that it can never be repeated '.
Darrius Bradhaw and Nick Rasconconi, Roger Malcom and Barnet Hatter, are practised on the other side of the House.
The proposal starts with a point where Malcom hushkits and work in Helster, who is saddened that Helster has had a relationship with Dorothyn.
'I did not hear 'I said that my country, my nonsense!'
Mr Rasconi, Mr Hester, replies.
Then there is the departure.
And then all the black players (at least all black players) are swamping in laughter.
Greenpeace is the biggest laughter.
'What '?
He is nothing.
'Why is it too severe? '
't ', Greenpeace is flourishing.
'I do not believe that the white people used the word 'nonsense' at that time.
"Therefore," and another black player confirms this.
"It is slander, you must use a longer version."
The subject of this proposal is unpleasant, but it is a veritable spirit of bloodshed.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the motion, but for the memory of those who have died.
It starts from the outset.
Now the words of Mr Rasconi are immense.
Nobody is laughing.
The new resistance will end swiftly and violently.
Auction, kidnapping - and silence.
A woman who is black husbandry is standing alongside the bodies and swimming Billie Holiday Stange Fruiet.
His voice is inherent in every other word.
At the end of a few ten metres, fifty watchmen have swept their eyes up in black and cynical terms.
Almost half of the public is black and half the white.
One of these is the paradox, which has come to look at the proposal for an Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited the wounds of the victims in Georgia with Brooros.
The tragedy has changed from the story to reality: The tunnel is a heavy one.
Following the presentation of the Lusau, Greenpeace invites a population to check the bodies.
Children are prepared to look at blood and non-mobile bodies and fight each other.
"They are not really dead", a small boy, but a father like reminding themselves.
In a few minutes' time, Greenpeace will thank the public.
The protagonists who have presented the players dismantle their references and cancel cycles.
Bradhaw holds Marbughh, a man from the local Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rasconconconi wants two players and then speaks with cynicism after a punitive proposal.
'no emergency ', the woman involved in the proposal is comfortable.
'We know that he is not.
You did so for good reasons. "
Later, the public and the players will meet together for the common evening.
The white parents who have come from Alysah are holding a lively debate with the black parent that they have just met.
Deniste Denktash is also difficult to find words when he describes the feelings of the motion.
'It is difficult to listen to the horrendous words and to look at the atrocities that people say and do, who seem to be the same as you, precisely because they appear to be the same as you do. '
'I found the proposal that there are still delays', he added, 'they are simply called arrests'.
On the other side of the House, Brok recalls the development of civil rights for hearers sitting on the same table.
He tells us that he has already begun planning next year's proposal.
'You resistance is a powerful experience because it reflects the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience ', as Mr Brook says.
'The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn lessons from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeating it. "
The dismantling of vegetable crops in shops is an illustration of the fact that the removal of 'additional components' is actually saving.
Is it permissible to dismantle the flowers even before they are weighed up?
What about it, however much weight?
The replies are very divided: For one, it is a sign of the extreme exportation, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetable that are not used and yet go home to plunder.
The phenomenon is well identified.
For example, there are bad boxes from the Deutscheduled Food DG in Helsinki, because many of the newspapers, for example, dismissed the flower.
The book takes the press to bio-waste.
According to the news published by Mr Talouss, the news is that the funeral of vegetables is surprising the traders.
But how much money will the removal of additional components of vegetables be saved before weighting?
How important is this really?
We Names tested how the price will change when you leave the press or the stock.
Narrow: The price of a flop of EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 when all the newspapers disappear.
Ananas: The price of total authorisation of EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position was withdrawn.
The anarchy is that the price of EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short-term position was cut off.
In short, two delicate pigs paid 75 cents in total.
Without the stock, 60 cents came at the price.
Parkan: A medium-sized couple cost EUR 1 and 80 cents without a position.
The end result is: If newspapers and stock leave, we will at best save a few dozens of cents in the case of one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
In other words, these purchases would have saved EUR 1.22!
Mr Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a five-year agreement with the PSGs.
The Brazilian-style Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSGs, AFP.
Earlier on, on Thursday evening, it was reported that the representatives of Neymari had paid the FC to Barcelona for the externalisation price of EUR 222 million.
The sum of EUR 222 million transferred is the biggest in football history.
In the past, the record was Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba last summer.
In the past, on Thursday, Spain blocked the transfer by abandoning the first attempt of Mr Neymari 's representatives.
According to the rules of the Italian Government, club purchased cannot be paid directly to the dealer, but the player itself must buy out of its contract, which is to be done by recycling money through the bulk.
In practice, PSG has paid a sum to Neymar and to the representatives of this House who sent the money to Barcelona through the bull.
It is believed that Mr Neymari will arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be presented to the new home public at home on Saturday's opening of the PSGs to Amina.
UEFA is examining the details.
Mr Barcel also stated in his report that he would provide information on the payment of the European Football Federation to UNEF, so that the Federation can determine the possible disciplinary measures arising from this case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish Alliance, has suspected the rules of UEFA 's economic fair play by using PSGs' criminal money.
UEFA can be punished for loss over EUR 30 million over three years.
According to UEFA, the transfer of NEFA does not automatically infringe its economic boxes.
The transfer of Neymar to PSGs will have an impact on the economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed beforehand.
For example, PSG could sell several players with substantial sums of money, and UNEF was informed.
The PSGs owns Qatar SPortuguese Sport Inwater.
The follow-up will be chaired by a former teaching profession, Czech Nasser-Khelifi.

Autilisi, 21, the firebreaks were thrown out of a secret attack - a bread broke up in the safe haven at airport.
Authorn Dunn had to take normal employment measures for an aircraft at Lunasasasassimia's International airport with a couple of working blood when suddenly bought a secret machine.
The forces of the secret fought in the Dunn country close to the brink of the plane.
Dunn was accelerated to the hospital.
He had a third level of fire injuries around his body.
My grandfather sunk me and said that the debt had an electrical attack and he is in hospital.
I asked whether he is alive, Australian sister Authuma says.
I spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to fires, he had meat slaughter and brain drain.
Experience was hard for the whole of the family.
That cannot be expected.
It is a tragedy for everyone, Authu tells us.
According to the representative of the airport, the system of alert was at the time of the case and the transport movement itself decides whether to comply with it.
Mr Pearsson will reduce 3 000 jobs and revitalise business by cutting back on sections.
On Friday, the British Education Group, Mr Pearson, announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the share by 72% in its launch of a new structural organisation programme in response to pressure on their business.
According to Professor John Fallonn, job cuts will be carried out mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, a company which has already reduced 4 000 jobs in the previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million in May as part of its third savings programme to reinvigorate the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Mr Pearson decided to sell his share of the Pengu Radom Housel tanker to his partner, Mr Bertelsmann, who announced that he would keep his sight for this year, with a turnover of up to 1% and EUR 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
The attack in Kabul: NATO soldiers died in suicide bombings.
According to the authorities, the suicide bombardment striked a military base in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, which killed NATO soldiers and many others.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were killed in the Kabul region.
On Tuesday, 30 people died in the mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died of the suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO 's opinion, Thursday evening' s explosion occurred when the joint coup between NATO and the Afghan army was subjected to an attack by a personal explosion.
The statement reported that the state of all injured was stable and treated in the American military hospital in Bagraham airport.
According to the turnover, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabar are of major concern to NATO troops near Bagra.
According to the UN, at least 1 62 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul in a region where mainly Chechen Muslims live.
The Taliban declared itself behind the attack.
On the last May, over 150 people died in the centre of Kabul in an attack on the country's most destructive militarist group after the American troops eating Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the destabilising situation in Afghanistan, when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the turnover, the suicide bombings in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, in its policy and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA is pillaging its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules on smoking.
The US Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, pillaged its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce emissions from the Obama Administration a day after 15 Länder had been brought to court.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called 'ozone definitions' in 2015 late on Wednesday, according to which it is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the federal states.
'We believe in the dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the Länder ', as Mr Scott Prust said in his opinion.
In June, Prush announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018, according to which the smoking rate in certain parts of the country is measured in order to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency challenged the fifteen Länder, mainly democratically controlled, including Distric of Colombia, according to which the moratorium was illegal.
President Donald Trushi's regime has sought ways of alleviating the environmental provisions of Back Obama, which, according to him, is part of a wider economic growth programme.
The measures taken by Mr Trush have been opposed by democrats and environmental protection who are concerned about the effects of an increase in emissions on health.
According to the EPA websites, 'without breathing' may undermine the operation of the spring and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morevy, Sydney had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
There was suspicion that the bomb was to be exported to aircraft on 15 July, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police do not say more precisely why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a equipment that separates toxic gas and to take the equipment to a full public place, for example in public transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings will continue.
The Director-General of the Nestone: Renewable fuels were well hit.
The result of the oil processor, Mr Nestone, was calculated before taxes, but the forecasts were identified in the second quarter.
According to Mr Lievon, the supplier, the company has achieved a good result in oil products, the quantity of renewable products has risen to record levels and the turnover in the Services-segmented sector was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business gains improved US Blenders Tax Credes tax relief.
According to Mr Liese, the commercial profits of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales levels and a more favourable market, even if tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investment that we have already announced in 2017, as Mr Liese said in the communication.
Movy Garcia and Vayl Lootsel will discuss possible matches at their first meeting.
On Thursday, Vayl Lootsel and Musy Garcia, who should be the most interesting in the immediate future of the 66.70s, met for the first time on Thursday.
Men were in their own rooms at the ESPNC's offices in Los Angela until the insurmountable spring champion of the WBC, Movy Garcia, went to welcome Loottleneck, the mayor of the WBO.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four classes of the World Cup in Show with the unanimous decision of Adjarcia Broner, after which Mr Garcia and Mr Lootsel have been among the five best of all categories on the comparative list of branches.
Mr Garcia put his right hand and asked: 'How do you go, the champion?
Good luck for a match! "
Will the Chechens defend themselves against Miguel Marriga from seven on Saturday?
When the two swept off to the photographs, Mr Egis KMuslims remarked that the interrogation between men would be 'complete' with regard to sizes.
'I am a former hushkits', Mr Garcia reminded us.
'I switched a sarch for the more general (63.5 kg) for Bronest, but I am not so big.
I am a small size of 63.5m.
I would like to return to the sky.
He has to rise in his light [61.2 kilos), and then we can take a step forward.
That is what our fans want.
Let us meet their wishes. "
The Chechens agreed.
'There is a need for this match '.
Mr KMuslims asked whether the match should be organised in a channel of payments, which is part of his strategy for the Lootsel dykle later this year and which will be taken next summer against Garcia (370, 30 daughter victories), and which would also be of interest to Garcia for the sake of Jorge Linner and Lukashenko Campollart in Lok and Campollart in Campallart, and on 3 September.
'This could be a payment channel because the fans have asked for it ', Mr Garcia said and subsequently stated that they were prepared to take the channels which offer the best pay package.
'We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else is paying less attention.
As soon as agreement is reached... "
Mr Garcia said that he appreciated Loysseko as' incredible oyster 'and that he was perhaps going to look at Saturday's match.
Did the Chechens interrupt the praise of the Garcia Heights and said that this three-class champion from Riblood seemed to be 'very slow'?
Mr Garcia said that he had focused first on showing the force of the attack and then on the crackdown.
The men said that they felt that the match between them was to become increasingly effective.
"This is the game that is expected.
No other complaint raises less attention and interest.
I am absolutely involved in this, "Mr Garcia said.
He said that he would have expected to be against the best.
It will be a wonderful match '.
Average salary of EUR 5 300, education and what happens - the situation of investment advice has been 'wild and free'.
Much has been said recently about the quality of investment advice.
Most recently, the Helsinki declarations reported on Rille, 68, to which the investment advice of the banking movement spoke of a complete pipeline when it selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
Tightening up is based on the new financial market directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the expertise of investment advisers and investment workers currently selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not lay down the requirements of excellence.
The Financial Perspective (FA) itself recommends that investment workers carry out their own APV1 or APVs inquiry.
The Financial Perspective has given the automobile to the organisation of APVs investigations for the APVs for the APVs, whose team of enquiry is represented by experts in both the Financial Control (Fiva), universities and some experts in the sector.
The scope of the investigations is between 1215 and 15 studies, and their advocates are drafting a wave of UE, i.e. the UCE, the UCITS Executive Education Ou.
It is reported on the website that, in general, both sexes are 'very broad in terms of requirements'.
The teaching of qualifications includes 1015 books and a number of other doctrines and deeds.
The APVs commissioner of the OSCE, Marku Saveni, tells us that the percentage of the killings is around 70%.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have been provided by almost all investment services, either APV1 or APV2, because they are mandatory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller banking movements without mentioning the names of whose staff appear to have expelled the qualifications, Mr Saveni says.
According to him, there are 'few' banking movements of this kind.
According to APV1, since 2000, 13 0014 000 people have been carrying out an APV1 investigation and some 3 000 people are more demanding for investment advisers.
Some bankers consider that it is in the interests of carrying out the investigation.
In a number of other areas of activity, there are considerably more stringent qualifications.
Will he say that the Financial Regulation requires APVs to be carried out, because that is where knowledge in the investment sector is guaranteed?
According to the Centre, financial and investment advisers know on average several thousand euros per month, including visions, natural interests and income premiums.
The average average of the regular working time of remunerated salaries is around EUR 5 300.
Men working on average know an average of EUR 5 900 per month and women equivalent to over EUR 4 500.
The tenth of those who know most earns about EUR 8 100 on average.
The tenth of men who know most earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, the most road-assisted one tenth of them is EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice can only be issued by a licence company under the investment law.
So far, self-regulation has been created at the level of worker and labour.
According to Mr van den Laan, the inspection received individual cases in which the expertise and competence of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the advice's work.
In principle, investment products can also be sold, even if skills and qualifications are low.
Basically, the situation has been wild and free in this respect.
In a number of other areas of activity, there are considerably more stringent qualification requirements, Mr Saveni says.
According to Mr Skinner, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up by the new financial market directive (MiFID II).
This requires every company to be responsible for the adequacy of staff offering investment services.
For its part, the Financial Control is authorised to determine what should be known.
The Flemish market controller, Markov Hov, says that one of the clear changes that is currently being made is the provision for the requirements for know-how and experience of investment advisers and investment products.
According to the Hover, the new requirements apply both to the personnel of investment firms and to the stakeholders who sell the products on behalf of a company.
Mr Howitt tells us that, according to the government's proposal to the Ministry of Finance, Mr Fiva has the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are, then, to be decided during the coming autumn.
In future, the company will also have to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to show this.
Mr Howitt specifies that in practice, for example, the company will have to map the staff 'performance at individual level.
This will certainly come from different standards, depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Hungarian, a new requirement is also to work with someone who is more experienced if knowledge or experience is not sufficiently high.
In other words, if a company employs a new worker who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the worker will have to work with the person who meets the criteria at a certain time.
According to the Hover, the rules will be tightened up and made more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamlin passenger cabin 'characterised' a giant aircraft over the United States.
The aircraft fly up to the United States in Flighradar 24 services.
On Thursday, the flight was carried out with 787 Dreamlin, which tested the sustainability of the plane Rolls Royce engines in a long flight.
In the first 18 hours and 1 minutes the machine leaving Seattle will be 15 700 km away, which is longer than any permanent trading flight in the world.
The flight stopped all the time within the borders of the United States.
It will first come through 17 federal states.
The persistent beautiful beautiful school schoolchildren will no longer be able to help the rain or the dark of sunshine - Iines Kadmar's burst with the help of a bathing village.
Iines Kadmad was at a good pace, followed by Taina Itkov.
In Lithuania and Lusaka this week and next week, the beautiful schools have plundered.
Although, in the meantime, hundreds of people are flourishing, young bathers are not motivated, Taust It.
This week, in bathers schools, the skill of bathers will be eradicated by a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week seemed to be assessing Mr Itkov at that time.
In collaboration with the project of unifying sport and the city of Itravel, the Iranra is being organised by the Iranian beautiful schools.
On Thursday, the baby had a pleasant tunnel.
The sun wounded and young bathing school pupils dreamt of staying on the brink of the clothes, something that has already been said.
Smaller guerrilla guerrillas were also flourished in water.
First of all, Iines Kadok, 5, thought deeper water.
However, he was always encouraged by Title Itski to bury the coast.
Well done!
Iines Kadmar told us that he had visited a great deal this summer.
The baby is good for him.
Like Iines Kakokokov, the bathing was persistent with Vili Hushen, 5.
I too am pleased with the achievements of today, the bathing praise.
Jamir Kallio, 4, once again wanted water wars.
Its daughter Anna Villberg, 6, went to the beaches, Ilo Villberg sees bathing schools as a good starting point for teaching.
Despite the fact that the weather has happened, Anna has every day dared to leave here.
There was a need for heating.
School pupils were forced on the shelter.
Patients have looked for integration with the harvest found on the beaches.
Milt Lukoso, 3, and Anna Villberg spreaded the wounds, naked fruit and fought for a day.
Education in water has already continued, but there was no urgency on the ground.
Such a thing as that does not belong in the summer.
An unknown sold military force sells a brake - 'This is a semi-semi-unified story'.
All this is evident.
A few days ago, the Sinimal product, which is manufactured with herbal products, has hit an unknown military product.
So it is the hairdressers and chickens - and the 'wall rings'.
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of leftovers in the autumn.
Nevertheless, there is something special in the combination, and products have been dismissed in the social media: When will the future TunTunTunisia health links be?
We need to look at a company and ask what this is about.
What does the Deputy Director of Sicily say?
We are a cinema partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and corporate cinema, Mr Mulder says.
According to him, products will be specialised and film will therefore be visible.
Is there not a bit of a habit here - often when you think that there is something common about products and supplies associated with them?
Yes, this is a seminar-combined story, that we are Finnish operators and these are Finnish products, Moderta says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that those who have seen an old unknown military state have seen.
And cleaning up is not foreign to the army culture.
For example, the unknown military cinema is Vallo, Hartwall, Salulldo, VR and hundreds.
So far, for example, the market has been put on the market by the Hartwall villages, which are known as Rok, Hietta and Kok.
Tunnel products have already been identified in the Finnish newspaper Blogical Kaynn as beautiful in Kaynn.
We already have coffee and clock.
I would like to point out that there is still time for film first, so the follow-up is still in place.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, for example, Valo, processors, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kiannul wrote.
Swedish asylum seekers' new results were published.
The latest results of the Swedish elderly medical tests for asylum seekers have been published, but the results of the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of tested tests are over 18 years old, but not all of us consider these tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Medicinal Product Office started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be assessed by the asylum seeker and not by the past; the new test was introduced after the criticism of the Swedish Immigration Agency for failing to define the real age of minors of those who have claimed to be minors.
So far, 6 880 tests have been carried out by the Medicines Agency, and the Agency for Medicinal Products has now published the results of the 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
The tested 80%, that is, 2002, the asylum seeker, was identified as over 18 years of age, and 25 cases of the 'possibly 18-year-old or older' test.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was reached that the asylum seeker may be under the age of 182.
Tests were carried out only where there was cause for suspicion of the age announced by the applicant.
After all, Mr Göranson from the Agency for Medicinal Products tells us that the results are in line with the results of previous months.
'The figures are fairly uniform; there are no major differences in statistics in recent months', he told The Loc.
Although a large proportion of the applicants were identified as being over 18 years old, that does not necessarily mean that the applicants had ever been elected.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases there were 'indications that the investigation had to be carried out between 18 and older'.
When a boat Dagbladt examined the same results, it emerged that, in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he would be complying with 18 years this year.
The medical evaluation method used for testing takes the pictures of advisory and magnetic images of polemics and then haemophiliacs and radiologists analyse the pictures, as well as criticism of the method.
One of the sceptics is the endocrine Claude Marcus of the Canary Institute, whose work is to evaluate human biological maturity, to see whether a person has been murdered earlier or later.
'I have had reason to think about this, and I do not think that the method used is the right one.
Defining biological age in this way is very doubtful.
If we cannot definitely define the age, we should not pretend that we can do so, he said to the Metroika newspaper.
However, Mr Granson, the Agency for the Protection of Medicinal Products, argued for the accuracy of the tests: 'In general, the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that of being tested in 18 years' time, in which case the risk is around 10% '.
Ilo collapsed thirty seats in Scotland.
Five more than the worst result of the third round was to take Mikko Ilo Ilo's thirty-thirds in the golf of competition in Scotland.
Ilo left eleven from divided to Saturday, but found out at the end of the round of 41.
Mr Ilosel was accumulated in a difficult fashion as a result of three bonds.
Others also had difficulty.
Ian Poulter, the English person, came to share the headquarters under one par, even though he said that there was enough work in the shadow.
Mr Keli was brutal, but the day was good, Mr Poulter.
He shares his fellow countryman, Callum Shinkwin, and Andrew Dodin, with top priority.
The Governor of Western Virginia exchanges the party.
On Thursday evening, the democratic Governor of Western Virginia, Jim Justinice, announced that he would change the party at the Trumpi campaign.
'democrats simply rejected me ', Mr Justine said.
'I can tell you today, after a lot of praises and thorough reflection... today I am telling the Western Westerners that I cannot help you as a democrat Governor. '
The public spoke of fantastic applause.
"Tomorrow 's registered Republican Party", Mr Justine added.
'For, I would say to you, is the time for a new game '.
In the past, Trump promised an important announcement of the campaign in Western Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia because Mr Justice did not support Mr Clinton.
Mr Justice was elected as a Governor in 2016 and, according to Mr Forbem, he is the only billions of governors of his State.
He cancelled his father in the mining industry and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth around USD 1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Rhine National Committee published a statement that 'Governor Justicen's change of party is another blow to a democratic party which is building barriers rather than better America'.
'democracies only have 15 Governors and fewer Länder than ever, in this situation Justicen's announcement is the last step backwards for a party which has no leadership and which is unable to find a positive message, a message that unites people, Ricna McDaniel said in his statement to the CBS news.
Salamans have sown the damage - Thursday will even come on a very rhetorical day in summer.
There will also be more from the week in Lopapua in Eastern Finland.
Over the past week, there has been a mixture of Central and Northern Finland, especially in the countries of Central and Northern Finland and in the Vartiwomen-Finland region.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the secret attacks caused several fires.
According to Medorological, Thursday may become a very meagre summer.
At last, Finland has also been discovered by the cabotage.
Over the past week, concealed, especially in the Central and Northern countries and in the Vartiwomen-Finland region.
In the street, the secret biscuit fought to the electricity centre, causing a small fire.
The fire was notified at about midnight by the fireworks plant.
The Centre was located in a window at the end of the winter.
The fireworks factories cleared up the ceiling and walls in order to find fire beds and exhaust the fire badly.
In total, eleven houses were left without electricity, but personal losses were avoided.
In the Loya, the secret was born up by the flames of the external building by Harkkjki before midnight.
When the rescue plant came to place, the building was already in full stages of fire and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of fire.
The entire external building of around 50 miles has returned to the country.
On the road to Kuophobia, the secrecy once again struck the home house.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a disgraceful scandal.
The installation was there to check the case, but, this time, the secret did not get a fire - only a few closures.
In the transport sector, the sudden caused problems on the train between Seapore and Vaasa, when the crash caused damage to the system of traffic control.
On Thursday morning, information was received on the innocence between eight and nine, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be resolved a little before five this afternoon.
Since then, train transport has been able to continue normally, including with the bulk of raw materials.
The Salamese have been able to destroy all over Finland.
But it has been relatively minimal this summer.
These summer bridges have been quite impassioned and the honourable meteorological loyalty of the atmosphere plant, Jari Tuov, has been assessed.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the toxins have mainly been relative to their intensity, but thanks to the little secrecy of the summer, this too seems to be a great many even strong.
This may seem a bit like a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit, but that is what it said in comparison with the summer, Mr Tuventin.
On Wednesday, secrecy rose 1 700 times, and Thursday has had a chance of even the severe summer holidays: Some 1 790 landscape in the chain by around 16 p.m.
If encryption continues to take place at the beginning of the evening, it will be possible to predict more than two thousand encrypts, Mr Tuov.
The previous record weak year was experienced in 2015, with about 30 000 chapters.
By Wednesday, the level of secrecy of this year had risen to 18 386.
So there is still room for manoeuvre so that this year does not infringe the 'record' of two years ago.
However, the Koskur may expect to continue.
It says that, even in the course of the weekend, Finland will remain a warm and cosmetic birth environment.
On Saturday, the main focus of the strikes will switch from northern parts of the country to the south, where the days of around 2 000 secrecy will be available both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more uniform rainfall in the middle of the country.
In such cases, it is only rarely true that there is a confusion.
Coe praises Russia's' generous' apologies for the doping scandal.
The world's global sporting bomb, Sebastian Coe, has described as being generally generous, as an apology from Russia for the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end the ban on Russia's participation.
At the IAFF Congress on Thursday, the Russian General Sport leader, Dmitri Shljarin, said that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he intends to fight resolutely against doping.
He said that he was sorry 'on behalf of all sportsmen and women taken to compete with the gold or hemicycle'.
Despite his comments, the IAFF Congress voted in favour of extending the ban, which was excluded from general sporting competition in November 2015 after the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the WADAF, provided evidence of state support in Russia for doping.
'I think that his reply today was very direct; it was a very generous presentation ', the President of the IAFF, Mr Coe, has told journalists.
'The entire Council and Congress welcomed the acknowledgement by the Russian General Sports Federation that this country has been through difficult times and declared that they are doing everything they can to reorganise their activities'.
Mr Coe said that he was' pleased 'also that Russia agreed to the conditions for closing the ban.
'I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but Congress supports the recommendation of the Working Group that it is not the time to lift the Russian ban ', Mr Coe said.
'We must do all we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep the clean sportsmen separate from the corrupt system. "
Nine Russian sportsmen and women compete with a neutral sportsmen and women in the MMMMAF, which begins in London on Friday, who have met the strict criteria of IAF.
On Monday, the leader of the IAFF Working Group, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still had to meet a number of requirements before it can be restored.
"Testing is still inadequate, and those who have obtained a ban still operate freely", he told the IAFF Council on Friday after his proposal in London.
The Tom of Finland was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Tom of Finland.
Tom of Finland was not the success that the perpetrators wanted.
To be honest, I am disappointed to recognise that the film producer, Anika Sucksdorf, has produced a cinema in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film public could be conservative and it seems that it is.
The film received its first reading in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair level of 100 000 spectators, which is the budget for cinema, around EUR 5 million.
There was no triumph on this, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful in their country, they would already have obtained their money.
Now we have to wait for the small clubs about foreign circulation, Sucksdorf says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Does Karur.
What impact the economic rules for football will have on the transfer of Neymre to Paris.
The provisions limiting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymari from Barcelona from Barcelona to Paris Saxon-Germar in France, which is the costly transfer of football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saxon-Germans (PSG) are decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from taking part in a valued Mecig's lighter.
UEFA introduced fair play economic rules by 2011, according to which PSGs must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymr has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona for concluding the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary of Neymari is circulating in ten million dollars.
There are many economic aspects involved in the transfer of the Neymar to France.
It is not difficult for PSGs to pay for and integrate the Neymari transfer sum into its geographical architecture, as the result of which is to fund the richer state of government with Qatar's oil.
Clubs may use large sums of money for the purchase of players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that football business is not defeated.
The economic rules of fair play were drawn up at the initiative of the French President of UEFA, Michel Platin, elected in 2007.
As a former football football, my Platform felt that the quest for success by debt was a waste and resulted in serious problems if the banks or owners had their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play on economic rules was shifted from the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that, for the first time in Roman Abrahadov, the implementation of the business model used in Celesseas in 2003 was greatly hampered, with a promising team in Abrahadov, a huge amount of money being spent on players and created a worldwide British.
The current three-year evaluation period of economic rules for fair play will last until 2018, with a maximum of EUR 30 million being lost.
Although my Platform had to leave the UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to curb the unrelenting use of clubs.
"The rules of fair play remain in place and we will continue to apply them in the future", a fair game of economic rules in UEFA, Andrea Tratax, reported to the Association Press Office last week.
Although PSG paid out the Neymar agreement on a one-off basis, it can cover the amount for the whole period of his new agreement.
Mr Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement so that the transfer amount can be recorded in the course of the next five years.
On the basis of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014, with the greatest sanctions imposed on PSGs and Manchester City, which is to be financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and it was also imposed to restrict it to the 21 players in the Mejigan group for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is observing clubs which may attempt to circumvent its economic provisions by increasing their income through the owners' undertakings.
If, for example, a Czech company supports the PSGs, but the value of aid is considered to be higher than usual market levels, UEFA will not count on support for actual income.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar tourist authority for PSGA was exceeded.
It has also emerged that some of the Neymar's merits could be financed by means of contributions from the Commission for the organisation of football competitions in Qatar in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Cooperation Commission have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador to MMMMs, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of previous PSGO sanctions, UEFA is more closely monitoring companies in circulation than usually.
On Thursday, UEFA has not been consulted with the PSGs on the transfer of Neymar.
They gave an interview to the Association Press Office on condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the power to discuss the situation in the PSK.
According to the latest publication of the accounts, the turnover of PSGs during the period 201516 was EUR 542.4 million and a business victory of over EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG is expected to attract new sponsors and increase the sponsorship of follow-up products and players.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymari Agreement.
The Spanish Maghreb, who is clearly one of the world's best players, tried to make the transfer of Neymari more difficult, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case, both in the club and in the state ', Javier Tebabas, the Spanish President of the ASS, said to the Spanish newspaper, which referred to the ownership of the PSGs.
Arsenal's continent Arsenal Wenger also has reservations about the State financing football club activities, which is owned by the American sporting flight.
"The incident is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years", Mr Wenger said on Thursday.
'everything is possible after the State owns its football team.
It will be very difficult to adhere to fair play economic rules, and there are so many interests in terms of the famous player representing the state.
Now is a matter of urgency: Finnish MAGPs in Helsinki.
In Helsinki, the spokesman of the Speaker of Mr Ghazaka and Mr Kristiina, Mr Ghazakhry, is in Helsinki, although he should be selecting general sport in the Movement in London.
Mr Mickela may have to compete without the advice of his selector.
Tomorrow, the Horn will compete in the slaughter of the length of the spade and on Saturday in the map of the triangle.
However, Mr Ghazakry, the Armenian leader, has not received a visa in Great Britain.
Mr Ghazakry has tried to deal with the matter without any result.
The Valencia has the invitation of the organisers of the Miss as documentation, but that too has not been acceptable to obtain a visa.
I wonder whether this is the first symptoms of Brexin or what Jorma Kemer said.
He has always managed visas successfully in the past, but there are now some problems.
He will do everything he can to get there.
Ghazarry has been working for years for the Finnish Urheight Federation SUL.
It is not so important.
If you look at the stadium's stadiums, you will see the signs that Argentina said he could remove his electorate.
Mmil for Finland, London, demands a miracle.
On Friday today in London, the MMAGPs in general sport will take place and will last a fair week at the end of Sunday, 13 August.
Sport, mainstreaming and rigidity are the species to which Finnish subcontractors share passionately each year, whether or not to be successful.
Success is measured in the hearts of sportsmen and women.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young sportsmen and women, where experience is made more mature to the level that adults MMS is genuinely possible.
Now, there are no young sportsmen and women in the small MMMS team in Finland, and certainly not cloned.
A miracle for Finland.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that it can also happen.
It draws subcontractors to the television screen and sweps to watch the walls, even if London's minds are solved only at night because of the difference in time.
From the previous Miss in general sport, Finland received one of the pronouncements.
It brought the voter, Terero Pitkkov.
Even today, the scandals are waiting for Pitkulas, while one tells him and others about the results of recent times and the survival of Pitch in the clothes of last summer.
Whatever happens in these cats, Mr Pitvski will remain a great Finnish sporting hero.
The other Finnish sportsmen and women have access to final competition or to their own record is sufficiently successful.
Hopes and faith in the realistic light of the coming years of general sport in Finland will also be a success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talents and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite of representative sportsmen and women.
Success will not come in one minute; it will require years of fantastic work for sportsmen and women to be patient, both from the choice and from the sportsmen.
Finns can also appreciate the international sporting stars and enjoy their unique performance.
Hopefully, the London Games will remain in history as the clothes of Usain Boli and Mo Faily, not for example because of the intimidation of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
My second point of view, Mr Copper's big airport, is: 'I am sorry.'
Another big Air Coldor of the United States has been based in the Lusmil School.
The champion of Coper Mountina is the best in the world cup of big Airways.
The women won Jamie Anderson in the United States.
The common sense has accumulated 147 points in competition.
He tried to do so for the first time in the cats and it was very close to success.
It seems good and good, but it is a pity that the last stick did not go too far.
I am going to do so from now on.
The big battle in Lusmil is a competitor for the hydrocarbons for the species.
Viking Lisi, a new rapid-speed vessel, left the port in Helsinki.
The new FSTR in Vikingen is very late on schedule.
The Pillar had to leave Helsinki from Helsinki to Talinna at 18 p.m.
Eight countries have loaded.
The ship arrived late in Helsinki.
For at least one and a half hours I have been waiting for a ship to be allowed to board.
Now the car is moving slightly, Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for access to the port of Helsinki, has reported at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that a new vessel had become a technical fault.
Rebane told us that the ship owner had brought water bottlenecks in his cars.
Mr Christa Grönlud, the chief communications Director of Vikingdin, says to the ISA that the loans were a technical fault.
It was corrected in the Helsinki port.
The vessel leaves Helsinki for a few hours late.
Grönlud says that the ship will also be delayed for a few hours from the return to Tallinne.
The ship was to leave Tallinna back from Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
Special transport of 422 metres disrupts transport on Thursday evening.
42 metres long, special transport will be transported from Mussa to the port of Mustos during Thursday evening.
Transportation from nine should be known by 11 evening.
The police are controlling transport in a white way, and traffic can be stopped at times.
Transport from Messrs is proceeding along 13 routes to the port of Mustos.
A small feature of Catalonia: Wealth bears American Sur and Comrade de Detheie.
The story is both the days of the nineties and the grung of the nineties (David Wah and Michael Showalter made a wonderful The State screen for MTV) and their own time - 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amu Pehler, Paul Ruda and others have gone to the bigger.
As a cultural product, it is both a photograph and a description of the ongoing revolution we have been blocked in the Facebo era.
It seems to be a commercial product for a long time.
First Day of Camp was surprisingly good, not just because of his absurd humour (it was reported, among other things, that Joan Benjami is speaking about the background of a vegetable story).
The essence of my joke is that medium-sized players seem to be approaching passions that are approaching full age, which makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Year Stalin, where adults look like adults, is less emotional and its paradox is more fragmented: For example, it puts the scaffolding of scaffolding fans in the 90s, as horror cinema went through every penny.
One of the fantastic points is Appele Powerbo, inlinguists and 'other cadmium from 1991'.
Many of the stories are the same as they used to be.
Michael Showalter is now a writer but has still not gone beyond Kaya (Marguerte Moreau).
Mr Victor (Ken Marino) has still done so.
And George H. Bush, who appears to be Michael Ian Black, is involved in a mad drink.
As always in such jargon, the best thing is by-side.
It is particularly tempting to see a young person, Paul Rudd, who has a paradox, namely Matt Dillo 's' soul patch ', from Single, who, as Mr Rudder showed, is starting to be an old mother.
At a time of random madness, the flight of this scarce may be raised as a kind of rushkit Sevenin, until it comes to a clear decision: The wealth is carrying out the American Suel - Tweet Years - and a friend goes to the first of American film.
The Amazon Comrade de Detheetrive again calls for a different breakthrough: The spirit of the Cold War in America, the Aibic Blonde film and even the weight of GLOWS.
The Komedia have created Brian Gathwood and Alessandrakis Tanaka, which has been guided by Rhent Thomas, a police tragedy in the 1980s in which the Brian couple is able to fight for truth, academism and Marxism.
As a hard-won Gregorna and an idealistic Ioseppe, the main parts of the world see Florin Piersic Jr and Coriu Ulitci as being seen in English, Chning Tatum, the main producer of the SARS, and Joseph Gordon-Leviu.
It is an excellent idea;
But that is not a great deal else.
There are some good whistle-blowers (policemen spend time looking at television skimmed in the same way as the Americans look at football).
There are a number of famous voters, including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Makhrhop Ali and Chloniki Sevigny, who, after all, have a glimmer games.
However, Comrade Detheft is too much sticking to the socialist tragedy - for example, behind the Reagannami, for example - which is why SARS is often beginning to feel a real blow of propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humility of the SARS is not rapid enough and not abundant.
In summary, SARS could be better served as an athletes, for example when Gregor Iosev and Iosev are repeatedly visiting the US embassies and there are always two meat men in the window.
The message to an imaginative Communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and food quickly.
The illuminating Roma creators of the SARS were not wrong: Our greed hurts our own history and their history.
On Saturday, my former UFCCC acquired in Macao by Tokyru.
Tokyo wants to keep the match in place.
Tokyard has a hard birth in Macao, because the Brazilian Leandro in Leandro last year was still in UFCC.
Brazil also has the black drain and the world champion of the species.
For once, I am against the parent.
It is a fuss, a 322-year-old Mr Taur tells us.
Last Saturday in Indonesia, the Koran had to rise in a chain.
The match was cancelled because of logistical problems, but three struggles were brought to the Chinese Autonomous Region in Macao.
Mr Taur has not been confronted with this before.
This is the first time that my complaint has been cancelled.
It was irritated because preparations and my treaties took a lot of time.
The rapporteur is pleased, however, that a new time has come for fighting.
The expectation of a week will not have much effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve one week.
The municipality can do more if it is doing too much now.
Mr Taur, in his previous struggle, has faced opponents who have the strength of being able to spread.
This time the situation is different.
Isavage people describe as a typical Brazilian.
He is rather aggressive.
I think he is going to be tough on one of the first tough things and is trying to take a journey.
He has won the World Cup so he has won the weight.
The previous Koran match did not go as planned.
The Philippines, Keviningo Belingon, badly watched Tauru and the Philippines won a victory.
I have never done so well, especially in my capacity: He did not get a single shop.
When I left, he went to my eyes.
That is a very long time to regret.
New motivation.
Some of the liberal professions once occur every year, some of them are getting worse.
For example, for the last time in September, the future 'no' opponent took place.
For its part, there were three complaints last year.
We are now faced with the second struggle of this year.
The pace has been heavy.
Over the past few years, I have devised and have been in good condition.
However, I have only complained about the spread.
When the 322 years of age heard of meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo and had the pleasure of doing so back.
We had very good treaties, with one blood from Sweden as well.
Training was a great help, because on Saturday the tourist will have to rely on physical struggle.
I have had the opportunity to treat against the same-size opponents and to practise arbitration.
It is therefore the main tactic of the 32s.
We need to make good sense.
If there is an opportunity, I will, of course, be taking the tonne myself.
Exports must not be allowed free of charge, as they are most expensive.
Macao is tempting the Tauru, which used to take place in China.
It is, as we know, China's Las Vegas.
I think there is a good and wonderful evening ahead of us.
The Federal Reserve in England stands at 0.25%.
The Federal Reserve is expected to declare that it is maintaining interest rates, as economic growth has been ineffective and inflation heavy has stopped speculation of interest rates.
The Federal Reserve has warned that economic growth continues to be slow; the bank moved interest rates because of increasing pressure on family revenue.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's monetary commission decided to increase by 0.25% by 62%, with fewer support this month because of the lack of economic growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecasts to 1.6% in 2018, and warned that domestic incomes are increasingly under pressure because inflation is expected to increase by less than 3% in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, interest increases will be needed over the next few years to curb the inflation rate that Brexin has accelerated, and the bank has stated that the costs of borrowing could be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brex referendum.
The bank will end the Term funning scheduled programme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to provide cheap funding for banks with a total of EUR 15 million.
The Minutes of the Bank 's decision on interest rates state:' According to the forecast of the monetary commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when the real fall in domestic revenue will be reduced '.
As far as interest rates are concerned, the bank reiterated the need for a sort of 'tightening-up' of monetary policy in terms of market expectations.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase is' progressive 'and' limited '.
In May, the bank forecast 1.9% growth this year and 1.7% growth next year.
Now it had 1.8% of its growth forecasts for 2018.
The red was weakened as a result of the news to the dollar and the euro.
With regard to the dollar, the GBP has fallen by 0.5% and was USD 1.31, which has fallen by 0.4% and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates as they stand was taken after the increased expectations of interest rates, which increased by 0.3% of GDP in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to stay at 0.3% at the third quarter, but that it will slow down a little at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation ceiling gave little hope to the households affected by inflation and low wages increases, and according to the bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent a 'income reduction' in the next few years, but it expects that wage trends will revive 'significantly' at the end of the three-year prediction period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of poor timber, which will reverse some of the effects of a fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were calculated to 0.25% after the outcome of the EU referendum, which was shocking, which is eating the fall in the bottleneck.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably only be reflected in prices and economies after four years.
Before the most recent decision by the Central Bank on interest redundancies, we had started to demand more and more loud demands when inflation broke down the pressure on households, three remaining in July calling for an increase of 0.5%.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% of 2.9%, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation is on the increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, exceeding the 2% target was due to weak weighting.
"In view of the recent fall in swaps interest rates, competition in the housing market would appear to be even more blackmail when creditors are suddenly seeking customers and want to end the year forcefully."
"The market seems to be particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end, with more popular agreements, low interest rates and also with non-consumption alternatives."
NHS number 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be called upon to turn a 'HIV-prohibition medicinal product', the Supreme Court brought to an end the dispute about the financing of a medicinal product in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS stated that PrEP would be imposed on around 10 000 people during the first three-year experiment and, before depleting, a medicinal product has been found to reduce the risk of infection by around 86% of people.
NHS agreed to fund this experiment after the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, which claims that NHS can pay for PREP, even though it is claimed that it should be financed by local authorities.
The leader of the NHS in England, Simon Stevens, described the decision announced on Thursday as' significant new interventions', as described by the National AIDS organisation as' a crucial moment '.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liondon and Shevardfield will be the first to receive notification of outbreaks for an experiment which will expand in October to other chickens, an experiment that will achieve its full scope by April 2018.
The PrEP must, in the meantime, support HIV medicinal product, which reduces infectious risk.
Experiments have shown that PrEP will significantly reduce HIV infection in risk groups.
Prior to depletion, a medicinal product means that there are enough medicinal products in the body of contamination that prevent HIV.
A medicinal product can take two hours on a daily basis or two hours before sex.
The target group includes homosexual men, bilaterally men and transit men and people with HIV positive partners, who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose the conditions for this experiment to satisfy the applicants for men, women and transit and those whose HIV positive partner does not know to be treated with antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and reporting to universal medical care can also seek an experiment with their local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost GBP 10 million and this week the NHS signed a contract on medicinal products following international tendering.
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP medicinal product by gathering extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and carrying out.
"This significant new intervention should complement and intensify the existing multifaceted and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"That is another major achievement of the fight that has been going on for more than thirty years to resolve the greatest health challenge for mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, the leader of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is properly targeted at those who need it and at risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, the risk groups will have a medicinal product that they will be able to decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, with a powerful effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news'.
'The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is rapidly launched throughout the country and that nobody in the risk groups is excluded ', says' Terrenence Higgin ', the leader of the Ian Great.
"The PrEPA medicinal product used in the experiment has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event which lasted unnecessarily for several months because of the government's slow-down" says, Mr Sharon Hodgson, the Deputy Minister for Health in the shadow government.
'We have evidence that a medicinal product can have a reverse effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
This experiment will help us to understand the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is now important that this experiment should be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and take a further step closer to the situation of the success of halting the spread of HIV in society. "
On the quality of life: Interim collection and fireworks of guerrilla solutions have made the small population of Earl's Courte landscape the home.
The former enthusiastic banking bank, Joanne Leigh, changed the smallest housing in the region of Knightsbridge in Earl's Courte by 2014.
The housing is at the first time of the daughter of the era of King Annan: The success of the Rhine reveals that Joanne has not yet fought and changed.
"Before that, I lived with me in Knightbridge in a much larger housing", Mrs Joanne.
'I am looking for something similar to my price creator.
I visited the housing demonstration here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my country at the time.
I was amazed straight away and made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, approximately 90 square houses have experienced a complete change.
It was a two-way street, where only the spring came to the hot House, and your Joanne wanted more room for storage and an interim collection in order to make good the poor quality.
'I wanted space, big windows and a great deal of light.
They were my request, he says.
He rewarded the work of the Duck & Shet planning agency in Notfan Azad, which had the task of taking advantage of nearly four metres of high rooms and creating a housing which is not just a revolution and sales point but a home.
The challenge was to build an interim gathering in which there was a stagnation.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complicated.
Farms had to be organised overlapping so that they do not need to be put at risk.
The structures had to be formulated in such a way that the quality is just as appropriate both in both their headquarters and elsewhere. "
Erfa was able to invest twice as much as two senior private targets.
The Mediterranean will open a Kurdish window of Kurdish to an elephant stay.
Deteriorating fish, hedge factories and Serge Moullain vetoes create a characteristic girl.
The use of the Philippines is a theatre, a state of knowledge and a light.
Short corridors at both ends will make it felt that the corridor is actually going further than that.
The hole in the interim state of the ethics is like a window of window open to another room.
There is room for storage for the athletes and swine fever in Joan.
More rigidity is the fact that the spring will be hidden when it is not used.
It is not a new solution to the television spring;
But it is unique in the Joan spring that the door should be raised in the same way as the car door.
'it called for little planning ', Erfan tells us about the steel surface in MDF.
"It is balanced, that is to say, it is very easy to put it in place."
With sound use of and plans for retention, Joanne obtained 16 additional squabbles, another mathematics and a better-based solution.
"Housing will be sold - or the dignity of the property", Mr Erfan.
"In the basic case, the property intermediary went home and falls on the basis of the surface sector."
In the living of Joan, the surface sector was added by using high-quality materials which make room more luxury.
'the resident is affected by housing materials, and the emotional de asbestos is partly born on that basis', Erfan says'.
"Nobody will be interested in the electrical boxes.
They too are important but not in the same way. "
The housing of Joan is an example of the fact that good planning and further platforms can make basic populations exceptionally splendid.
It may then also be possible for residence to no longer be changed.
Sofia radiated in its summer holidays in the pregnant priest.
The election of Soviet people in the prprprprime went into the biscuit.
For the last time in the first instance, Sofia was represented in Beijing in Sweden before they were born.
In the evening of the Hungarian Somnable Tomorrow event, a nonsense had been chosen.
Sofia was represented on the occasion as a smile.
In Sweden's prime tribunal, Sofia has visited Beijing in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented a splendid blueprint of a beautiful blueprint in the A Somnable Tomorrow seminar which smacks of pregnancy in its last pregnancy.
Sofia arrived in a thousand inhabitants.
This is the last time that Sofia is represented before its birth.
His time has been calculated in September.
Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastegic meal, which had fallen magnificently.
The girl was crushed by large compensation payments and a narrow stick.
Mr Pasteitis was a wonderful piece in the window.
Sofia has been present this week in Beijing in Sweden.
Sofia was fed on a small-scale square.
Sofia was actually radiated in its dark summer holidays.
Sofia even appeared to drink the photographs.
Now, when I hide, Mr Sofia said that he was laughing and referred to his final burden.
He breeds us with a sweetener club.
In the summer of 1996, there was a test for the towers of the Gulf to sell Catholic food.
The people of Lah did not dare to land, they did not dare to do so.
In Kok, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentla, between familiar Pantlan.
He did not have much to do with Finns, and the Finns did not yet manage to do so.
Because it did not dare to eat, Mr Panama offered free landscape.
In doing so, he teached the sheep to eat hatred, spring at one.
From countries, he said.
I left a doctrine.
I have visited more and more times, ultimately every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panama opened his hair food in the Gulf.
There were two small protocols, less than 20 customers.
He has taught us not only to eat hatred food, but also to sit alongside each other.
When there is hunger and restricted locations, we cannot leave behind the plane between ourselves and the other.
In the short term, we were better familiar with and we became more expensive.
In the end, I met on a plate with a letter of words to learn hatred.
Two years went on to trade, but then the food supplement had to change, as the mathematics themselves are told to be over-controlled.
A new location was released from the end of the Kauppi.
There is room there.
Now we drink again in our own table, only at the most congested times will we have to ask ourselves whether there is a space next.
Mr Panananama knows his client.
He is told what has happened and who has been seen.
He knows what food he eats.
He has seen how the phases of life of customers vary and food monitoring is changing.
He recalls which man I went to eat my first spring.
He recalls me as a joke and meat, and reminds me of what I was young.
It is unacceptable to go to lunch a little later than others, to sit next to my place of the clothes of the spring door and to exchange them with the Panama, who is in a distiller.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught us tolerance and internationality in a sweeping chickens.
He has opened up our ideas and our hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak to him - thank you for the tourist tourist box.
I admire Mr Panama.
Although he has had difficulty, he is always friendly.
He is hard-working.
He is in the pipeline and black.
Last week, a restaurant was celebrated for two decades.
We customers have been able to eat a hectare.
Without alarm or attention, this important day took place, in the course of work.
The discovery of a secular base revealed 173 Isch terrorists who were prepared to strike in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 Isch fighters who are prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, 173 people have a total of 173 people and the document contains pictures of everyone.
More than 130 of the people mentioned on the list are Iraqi, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The remaining are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazhikhikhikhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Mrs Iltalit has told us about the list and a few weeks ago.
Now, the location of the list and the information it contains have been more precise.
According to the press, the Iraqi army's special forces found the personal data and images of terrorists in investigating the country-by-country support of the terrorist organisation in Moos.
The US intelligence services evaluate the true nature of paper and sent it to Interpol.
The list was distributed from INTERREG to all the security authorities in the countries of Europe in May.
The background was the fear that there would be some great and serious plans in the Western countries to act by terrorists in the immediate east of Isin.
Die Welt said that the list not only includes all people 's names and images, but also their age of birth, the inventions and information about the country of origin of the person.
The list also identifies specialist terrorists.
For example, the German 270s of Sami J., on the list, says Abu Assid-Almann, German.
He is reported to have gone from Germany in 2012 to Egypt first, then Libya and, later, via Turkey, to join Syria in order to join the ranks of Isin.
His description is written as a special suicide bomber.
There is no more precise information on the fate of the man.
In total, about 6 000 fighters have left Europe to Isin, whose fate is uncertain.
The man crashed under the line of Helsinki in Toxin.
On the basis of interview between the rescue plant, the man had wanted to show that he had been divided.
Even the explanatory statement can save a loss of life.
On Thursday, Helsinki saved a person under water.
According to Mr Estlanders, a friend of the Helsinki civil rescue plant, the situation was rapidly over.
A person was found from the water for about 15 minutes after notification.
Mr Estlanders tells him that he was the winner of the rescue plant.
Half the notice was received by the Institute after four years this afternoon.
The person was placed in the hands of first care.
Mr Estland tells us that this was a man of about 50 years of age.
On the basis of the correspondence, the man had wanted to show that he was divided.
The situation in Toxin is already over.
Mr Estlander is grateful to the authorities for their cooperation with the border guards and police.
It was a task led by the border guards.
The players also learned very well.

Brothers are fighting for property of over USD 500 million.
Two brothers are arguing about the largest building power in Victoria, worth more than USD 500 million, which is linked to the family company set up by their Italian family 40 years ago.
The former Chairman of the Carlton football club, Colin De Lutis living in the area of Toorak only three farms from the younger brothers, Mr Paululull, and the younger brother, has taken to the Supreme Court the dispute over the distribution of property and business assets between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company as early as 2014, but there is a bitter dispute.
Brothers and their mothers, Anna, are jointly owning 38 buildings worth more than USD half a billion, starting with the property collected by buying Colingood from Street in 1973.
The family set up there the Westco Jenes trade, which expanded to 160 movements.
The market chain was sold at USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on buildings, and today the family owns offices, buildings areas in Brunswill and Sorrento and houses in Gold Coaste and Met Bill, as well as the purchasing centres of benchmarks.
According to the agreement reached with the former father of the family, Colin owns approximately two thirds of the asset of the Paul company, which describes its father as' a vigorous and centralistic force and centralisation of the family '.
According to the legal documents, the distribution of property means that Colin owns buildings of around USD 316 million and the value of Paul USD 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of buildings and funds.
'I think that Mr Colin's proposal left the best buildings for himself ', Mr Paul wrote in his first insight to justice in 2015.
Last Friday, for the first time in the Supreme Court after several conciliation attempts.
Brothers are now also arguing about who manages existing business, and Mr Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from business.
According to Mr Colin, this is not the case and he is accusing Mrs Paulsen of mismanagement of certain buildings.
Mr Colin wrote together from his first false evidence that he would like to see a solution.
'In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me ', Mr Colin says in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of reports, e-mails and reports, such as Delos, Pietcher Partnership and Charter Keck Crama, which are constantly increasing costs: Consultancy companies such as the sea, and the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Mr De Lutis and his marriage Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk blocks and delicate trading at the end of the 1950s.
They were used as a persuasion in the purchase of the family from Colingwood to which Colin founded the first farce trade in the family.
Mr Colin tells us that he had created a 'trade' in the last few years, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Mr De Lutis tells us that he and Mr Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer buildings to their patients in a suitable manner.
'Luigi often said that he did not want brothers to be brought to justice ', Anna wrote in his opinion.
The two other boys of the family, Mark and Lukashenko, are no longer involved in the business of De Lutis, according to Colin, Mark received USD 10 million and Lukashenko USD 26 million in leaving the company.
According to Mr Paulsen, Lukashenko and Mark are 'bitterly based on economic conditions'.
Colin has had a low profile, even though it is a former member of the Australian government of the football club and TV spring to Eddddie McGuirei's best friend on the basis of this life that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutt and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Mr Colin replied, and he said in his message that it is not right to comment on this because it is being dealt with in court.
'It is very sad that my brother, Mr Paul, has decided to bring me to justice and to refer our family to the legal battle, 'he wrote.
In mid-2016, Mr Colin wrote to the right to try to comply with the demands of his brothers.
"Our father would not have liked us to fight in this way", Mr Colin continued and said that he hoped that a solution will be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have arisen.
'We shall be brought to justice in the near future ', Mr Colin wrote.
The new Director of staff in Trushi intends to restrict the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Key will finally succeed.
First of all.
According to the Polticio newspaper, the new Director-General of the Belarus intends to restrict the use of President Trushi 's media and the monitoring of news so that the bomb is not so often hindered.
The journalist, Josh Dawsey, has reported:
"When the new Director-General of the Belarus, John F. Keynn, met his first working day with the management staff, he raised the key problem he intends to resolve: He intends to restrict access to information from President Donald Trushi.
Mr Keyne told the workers in the Belarus that all the information - both printed and consulted at the information conferences - must go through him, because the President will take better decisions when he gets good information. "
The words of Mr Kelly make sense, but others have tried to limit the use and failure of the media in Trushi.
President Trushi has a relationship with television for decades - and as President he still sees a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate, Mr Trump, came up with an unfair reinvigoration, he was in favour of showing that the media in sympathetic media handled matters in a more balanced way", Sam Nunberg, who worked as adviser in the Trushi campaign, said in February.
At the time, the journalist Tara Palmeri wrote: 'According to six former campaigners, it is essential to control the use of Trumpin Triki' s use that his personal media virus should be equal to the flow of praise '.
Clearly.
It is ridiculous, however, to say that the use of Trushi would ever have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know what the others do not know - perhaps the Trushi Trushi would have done even more without their efforts.
We will probably never know the messages from Trushi.
If his staff have at least been able to prevent him from causing problems, they will not have been in vain.
However, nobody has consistently been able to prevent Mr Trukumpi from causing it.
Part of the problem is that there are competing groups in the Belarus that are trying to drive things forward by providing information to Mr Trush, which supports their views, which can be reliable or not.
In May, Mr Politico wrote that the advisors were deliberately giving the President information that was questionable.
The journalist, Shane Goldmacher, has reported a case:
'The current and former workers in Trushi say that they can exaggerate a great deal of the newspapers in which they are criticised - especially if they are told about harmful databases, so that they are forced to know where the information is coming from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone had a copy of the news of the Gotwscow News.com website set up by Mr Johnson accused Dr Katie Walshia of a number of information leaks in the Belarus.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twietter because of harassment and had in the past disseminated false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun to stay after reading the staff in Walshire. "
Mr Goldmacher added that the then staff Director-General Reince Priebel and Mr Rob Portters had tried to introduce a system for managing documents in Tru.
And what was the outcome?
Mr Keyne is trying the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Mr Priebel, but Mr Trump is still one of his own wife and his assistants will continue to drive his own affairs.
These unchanged facts make the task of Mr Kelly very difficult.
Mr Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with the PSGs.
The Brazilian-style Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSGs, AFP.
Earlier on, on Thursday evening, it was reported that the representatives of Neymari had paid the FC to Barcelona for the externalisation price of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar Agreement with Barcelona was therefore dismantled, and he was free to move on to PSGs.
The sum of EUR 222 million transferred is the biggest in football history.
In the past, the record was Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba last summer.
The PSGs owns Qatar SPortuguese Sport Inwater.
The follow-up will be chaired by a former teaching profession, Czech Nasser-Khelifi.
It is believed that Mr Neymari will arrive in Paris on Friday.

Mr Hynososis helped Raille Ora.
Five children will consider music in addition to writing that Ramil and his husbandry Jyr abandoned the Spanish sunshine and the living of Fuengirol after 18 winter.
First they sold their house, but now, in the spring, they also left the temporary housing.
In the light of the light and sun, the old champions of Ramien were at the time the assimilation and alcohol that he has discovered.
The external existence is 20 kg lower.
The pressure went down when heroic medicinal products were closed.
I was able to help alcohol at the time, as was also the case with fear of flight.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol exports a human being, a radio author says openly.
Ramil and Jyr Organan have travelled for over 45 years.
I can do more than ever.
The Red Cross and the tourist industry have been working together for over 40 years.
I experienced, and that was naïve, in two weeks, Ramil.
Such a dramatic Queen has always stopped his lifetime, Jyr is laughing for his wife.
The great writer writer writer writer, Oranen, has only remembered good 40s of clean walls in the cup for and moving to Finland for a recession.
I finally decided to fall within the clothing industry, when I read Lithuania Seppänen's 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I myself was an own girl, my mother also had a clothing movement and I sometimes used to be continental, Mr Ortuondo.
He changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anna Savani 's study and argument revealed it, Mr Oranen.
Ramil Organan lives as a writer of active time, he has many ideas under the written work - hundreds of ideas.
The Germans returned over the crossroads'.
The wealthiest owners of West Midlands are once again thrown up with persistent circles that managed to overcome the desperate section of the municipal site and return to housing.
The Germans stopped the disappearance of twenty of their housing near what they call the millionaires in Soliah.
They were driven out of the region in May, but they managed to overcome the power that they needed as a barrier to the municipal, with children, horses and the army of package cars.
The Germans succeeded in overcoming the transit point that had not been protected because of the incineration.
The exaggerated inhabitants have accused the Solimad province of the complete inability to resolve the problem. "
The inhabitant who has stayed anonymously tells us that, when the other types of circulation came from Bentley Heath, they had thrown in stone.
"A society must be fought to act because it seems to be completely incapable of resolving the problem.
The Germans were here in May, then they left and returned.
They arrived at more and probably even more today '.
The inhabitant told us that Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
'I live in Streetsbrok Roadad and it is frustrating to pay local tax when a society cannot do anything about it '.
It is ridiculous, according to a second anonymous person, that the recycling should be returned so soon after driven away.
"There are more of them, and they have even counted the horse in the park."
According to the scientist of the municipal councillor of Solimad, the House is aware of the illegal dissemination around Streetsbrok Roadi: 'We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Solior police to put the camps in place as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many local authorities as possible should notify the police of disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
The exaggerated people inside Portuguese cowboy.
In Portugal, the men who have died on the beaches have been tried before the courts today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the calculation.
Two men flying the plane can be prosecuted for the death rate.
In Portugal, the biggest possible way of obtaining 16 years of imprisonment is to be found.
Yesterday, the small machine flying by men had to make a compulsory bill for the Sao Joo da Caparca, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the coast at the time, some of whom are driven into the water.
When the plane landed to the 56th-year-old man and the girl who died immediately.
The machine was first composed of a man who was a body.
Immediately afterwards, the plane rose upwards and, once again, it was borne out by the child, told us that the beach had Filipe Jornal de Noticia.
The young girls who have died were in touch with their parents.
Girls' parents were not injured.
On the beaches, the small machine became angry immediately after the disaster.
The girls and other people went to the plane and started looking for it, reported on the case in the Celche Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a crime, he was desperate.
It is surprising that more people did not die.
Two men had not been injured in a compulsory calculation.
The Finnish destination, which has been tragically lost, again won MMMs: 'Without an accident, I would not be the World Cup'.
Earlier on Wednesday morning, in the Gulf of the Commonwealth in Canada Big Whitehead, Matti-Hami celebrated Finns.
In the past, he won the Cross Mount.
All in all, three Miss have already accumulated.
Quite incredible MGs!
Twice the gold was treated, quite a good stick is water, the Shurster Hamar, which was sought by telephone.
A 30-year-old glass thank her for her selector and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Shur Hamar, the number of butchers in the species is increasing.
The whole paramilitaries have grown and developed a great deal recently.
The differences are decreasing and there are many new bills involved.
It is always wonderful whether someone will guarantee a black horse.
Every winner seems to be a different winner.
In 2009, a second motorcycle accident lost its junta.
He had calculated with great enthusiasm from the young to his friends, and he did not want to get to grips with it.
Let us remember from time to time what my life would be without that disaster.
But my attitude has always been that it is pointless to hide.
They play what has been distributed, Mrs Sorrone Hamar emphasises.
It would be cruel to see a serious accident and the loss of the border as a knee-jerk, and that is not the case either.
But he has turned the caricature into a dreadful problem.
I would say that the situation was a victory.
I would not be a three-way world champion without an accident.
In the run-up to the accident, the biggest box of the 23th Horn was already in the pipeline.
It was only after the accident that Mr Duma began in a real way.
Mr Trentas was a young man with blood, and we always knew Mr X. Games with great enthusiasm.
But they were remote dreams which, for a certain amount of time, dreamt.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere from the XXth-Games story.
I would not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23th anniversary and I thought that this will be a long life if I leave here to be bitter and saddened.
I decided to withdraw the wounds and start work.
I would say that I have managed quite well.
For the sake of Laskay-Pekka, the chosen to be a year 's sportsman was very happy.
The sudden Olympic winner won his salary in the sporting games held in January.
According to Mrs Sorrone Hamar, profit is an important signal to the paradox.
It was a real victory and a victory was certainly earned.
This will certainly also open the door to the paradigm world.
Since it is time to launch a two-world champion Matti Shur's annual sportsmen and women?
It will then be seen in due course.
I will try to do my best to succeed.
Mrs Sorrone Hamar has still not occupied all the clothes that he has been passionate.
Next year we will have a great goal.
In a year 's time, the paralysis will take place in South Korea.
We are starting to apply for mines!
The majority of young people in Syria do not believe that they will return to their country permanently unless war enters and Isis leave the country.
An investigation into the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon was carried out.
Refugees in Syria are fleeing in the refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their country permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and the departure of Isin are the most important things that should happen to enable them to return to their country of origin.
The Trushi regime does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The village chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, the views and attitudes of Arab young people have been examined by Burson-Marsteller.
This year, the A Voice for Yyran Refugees study clarified the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February 2017, the study responded to a total of 400 young Syrian young people aged between 18 and 24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, over half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will continue to return to their country in the future.
42% of the equivalents can be considered to return to their country of origin and 4% could not be said.
According to the study, the decision of young people to repatriate their homes is most affected by the current war in Syria and by the presence of Mr Isin.
Nearly half (47%) considers the end of the war to be the biggest factor in permanent return, while the fourth priority would be to leave the country.
Only one tenth will make the most important factor in the decision-making process of improving the economic situation or leaving Bashar-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict.
Young people in Syria were asked what is the most important factor in closing the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more essential than the abolition of President Bashar-Assad.
A quarter of the presidency of Assad is considered to be an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Nearly half the feeling is that political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter do you believe that military action alone can resolve the conflict.
The majority of Syrian refugees see their power weakened in the last year, whereas the fifth feels that its power has been strengthened.
According to the recipients, the most important thing in the fight against Iss, and it is generally the media that informs people that Iski has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people put military measures and education reform as a priority.
A fair decade considers that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
66% of the repercussions of the Trushkum regime on the Syrian conflict believe that the conflict will not change during the Trukumpi regime.
Almost one quarter of the population believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the Trumpi era.
There are two different opinions as to whether the involvement of Russia, as well as Iran, has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widtnius spends half its time in order to keep the net in order - the database he has developed using, for example, Wiiland Google.
The specific company, Marianne DB, is developing 'the fastest growing' open source database in the world.
Michael Michael's main product of the Maria DB, the Kodarieus entrepreneur, will pay nothing to the users and can be developed through NET by any software that is going to take place.
For example, Mr Google and Mr Wiphert are users of the Finnish database, but those who pay are not necessarily.
By means of databases, massive databases remain in order and rapidly available.
If you use, for example, Lindin, Twietter or Bokkkins, you will take advantage of the database of Maria DB or Myyyield-square.
"All information that is not described will come from the database and each of them has been bought there" will explain Mr Widenius.
Some half the time spent on Maria's technology leader Widelenius.
The distance-working man in Kayan will play their part in ensuring that the Internet functions in a tolerant manner.
Mr Widtnius, together with a Swedish David Axar, developed the most popular database of the world's preferred source code.
In 2008, the Technical Sun Sun-Sun Mylla USD USD 1 billion, and a year later, the software company left Mr Oracle greedy Sunin by 7.4 billion.
When the Orchair trade occurred, a large proportion of MyynSQL developers declared themselves to be leaving.
"They did not want to work for Mr Oraca, who did not make a certain promise of the future of MynySQL".
He had already set up a company that began to develop Marianne DB at this stage.
He did not want his life to die.
I paid for the twenty best developments in Sun and ensured that the continuity of the code will be safeguarded by the same stretches that it was created.
Since MyyynSQL is an open source database, Maria DB was able to develop its own architecture.
The name simply had to be changed.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the Maritime DB code.
'Myny SQQL has not done so ', Mr Widenius is disappointed.
Although many people have heard of Wideland the MynySQL's billions of trade, few Finns know nothing about Maria DB.
'In the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year ', the Marian economic leader Kenneth Paysvalélén, Kenneth, says.
The Marianne DB, which is concentrated on growth, is not yet making a victory, and Mr Pacyvalélén is a narrow word on the company's percentage.
To that extent, he reveals that, in the current financial year, Maria DB estimates that it will be able to provide opportunities of EUR 20 million.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are prepared to pay.
Maria DB also helps to exchange databases, which may be a love for more than a year if the customer has used the closed database.
MyynSQL will succeed in the middle of the day because they are different versions.
Among other things, the Spanish operator, Telefónica, and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are Maria DB customers.
The most popular pilot services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azur, Aliba Cloud, offer their customers Marianne DB.
At the same time, Maria DB will automatically spread to the new users in the Linux distribution packages, where MarianDB has largely replaced Myyanux.
Although we are a small flora, we have links with the major players.
'Where is one of our biggest telecommunications operators in the world, players, banks and even a single central bank ', the Pazakhén list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Orca, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in closed databases.
Even for Mr Orchaley, MynySQL is a modest side-effect compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
Despite the fact that, according to Mr Gartner, the largest databases have lost their share of the market over recent years, savings such as Maria DB are still insignificant, albeit rapidly growing.
Around USD 50 billion in the database market, the databases for an open source code are not even up to one billion.
However, the weight of an open source code cannot be measured only in money, because most users pay nothing from these software.
The Temporary Company, Gartner, predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop over 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
More than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged, or the transition would at least have begun.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most of them will now choose an open source code.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases being slow down.
Companies want to spend as much as they used to do with a smaller number of customers, Mr Widenius is considering.
Since it is difficult to change the closed database, most customer companies have lived up lightly.
"There are many customers who are very difficult to move because their old applications and others are in a closed database", Mr Widelunius says.
He still believes that the number of customers is about to be full.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later move on to the database of an open source code.
The price is between 1020% and 20% of the previous price, and the service is better because, if the customer so wishes, he can easily exchange another database.
Furthermore, many companies are faced with major changes to the system in transferring their activities to pilot services.
At the same time, many people exchange database software.
Last spring, MarianDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank EIBB.
It was the largest contribution from the EIBB to growth ever made to the Nordic countries.
There are about 115 employees worldwide and are now to be rewarded.
One of the reasons why the EIB was financed was the impact of Maria DB on public procurement.
A company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe is paying billions of euros annually from the databases.
"Many countries want to move on to the solutions of the open source code, thereby using tax money more effectively", as Mr Paxén says.
I regret the way in which Finland spends money on closed health systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and there is no extensive knowledge at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it is a better way of coding.
The Community is helping and doing something that cannot be done for itself or for which it is unable to do so.
The 550s-old Widtnius is one of the most well-known promoters of Linus Torrard, together with the other Finns, Linux.
Wideleus will help other companies to develop workable business models at the top of the open source code.
I still have 45 speeches on this subject every year throughout the world.
Italy is stepping up its attitude towards the rescue vessels of NGOs.
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations which save refugees in the Mediterranean by their vessels that they must not continue to operate unless the new rules for their activities are complied with.
"If non-governmental organisations do not commit themselves to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate", Mr Marco Minnille said in an interview with the Doctor La Stama.
The warning by Mr Minnille came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the German Jugd Reent Assistance Organisation, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human traffickers who promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago did the Assistance Organisation refuse to comment on the details of the prosecutor Ambrogio Carte.
'We feel that saving human lives is and will be the most important thing, and we very much regret the fact that we are currently unable to act in the search and rescue area ', an organisation announced in its social media opinion.
'We can only judge the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and evaluate the situation '.
Since the beginning of October, the Italian authorities had been observing the Jugd Reenta organisation.
The crew is suspected that the crew has gradually taken refugees directly from smugglers of human beings who have restored boats.
One such case is claimed to have occurred only a few kilometres away from Libya's coast, which is reflected in a prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of threatening the Italian coastguard, which is controlling rescue operations in the region, the motive being the enthusiasm for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should have an Italian police force to monitor the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the course of action: Pelasta Laps, MOAS and the Spanish Professor Ona Arms;
Anyone who stated on Thursday that he considered the new rules to be superfluous but acceptable, because they do not cause any significant changes or obstacles to the organisation's rescue.
Among those who refused to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel Frontier without Frontiers.
Mr Minnille, for his part, said that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy has fallen dramatically in recent weeks, as he sees it as an expression of the fact that measures to strengthen the Libya coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"Over the last few days, the Minister said" the light has begun at the end of the tunnel.
He said that plans will continue this month to discuss projects for economic development with Libya 's mayors and measures to reduce the number of refugees who go to Europe.
Suspected of killing his unmarried partner in Eonte, suspected of the milk - the prosecutor went to the public prosecutor.
The suspected crime occurred in Enonte Kutta last December.
According to the police, a Theikh man aged 360s is suspected of killing his Scottish unmarried partner at 260s.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspects would have fled with two dogs in the milk since they have done so.
The man was found to be cold-fashioned, and he did not resist it.
The accusation must be raised within less than a week.
The case may still be brought before Lapland's top-level court in August.
Mr Harry Potter and Mr Robert Hardy, a friend of all sorts, have died.
Robert Hardy has died in 911 years of age.
On Thursday, the death of the witnesser reported this family.
The 1925 birth of Hardy began his demonstrator in theatre at 240s.
During his long career, he also visited films and television.
In particular, Mr Hardy is remembered for the role of the magic minister, Mr Cornius Toffin, in Harry Potterter, as well as for his veterinary role in the James Herriot book, my absurd friend on television.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment on textiles which instigated suicide.
A woman in Massachusettchen has been sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment on textiles and telephone messages which he was perceived as an incitement to the suicide of his son, Conrad Royal.
Michelle Carter, 20 months in prison, 15 months in prison and five years in a candidate.
In June, Carter was sentenced to mail and his son, Conrad Roy, made suicide bombing on 13 and 7.14.
'my family has been murdered ', the father of Conrad said at Thursday's sitting.
'my son was my best friend '.
Carter asked for a change to the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be made in freedom.
He was threatened with a sentence of 20 years, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy will suffer from health problems.
Mr Carter, who falls into the Red Cross, listened to the hands of his judgment in cross-cutting, with a ceiling in the country.
"His actions killed Conrad Royal," the prosecutor said to the courts.
"He decided to live in Conrad to improve his own life.
He has not taken responsibility for it, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown disappearance".
According to Mrs Carter's lawyer, the case was the result of 'appalling circumstances which Carter is deeply disappearing'.
However, the judge, Lawrence Moniz, thought that Carter 's age or maturity did not have a significant impact on his actions.
The prosecutor read the statement by the Conrad mother, Lynn Royal, in which the mother said that 'no day goes without saying that I would not be saddened by the death of my loved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I am going to cope with all of this, and I shall do my best to reassure his guerrillas in the pain that we will always be carrying out.
Conrad's guerrilla Camy Roy told us that he would never see his brothers shame and that he would not be that for his children.
'It is painful to lose the person who has been in my life every day since I was born, and that is never too hard ', Mr Camy.
This incident seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the State of Massachusettchettle to incit suicide as a crime.
Carter was 170s when Roy was found dead in the car to be poisoned in 2014.
The incident was revealed by the authorities when it became apparent that Carter had incited his son to make suicide.
'Hira himself, a brave Catholic, a woodland, I do not know how many ways there are, 'Carter wrote in many of the signals he had sent to Royal in the last two weeks, when he was on holiday with his family.
Only a little before the Rome suicide bomb, Carter wrote: 'You must do that, Conrad' and 'Sinn must only start a generator, and you are free and happy'.
The judge, Mr Moniz, said that Carter drew attention to the death of Royal Ryal, stipulated that Carter should not benefit from this case by providing interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of the experts.
Few have defended Mrs Carter, one of the defendants is Aminda Knox, 30 convicted of the murder of their British counterparts in Italy in 2007, which was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the Knox opinion statement in which he says' Michelle Carter needs sympathy and assistance, not prison '.
Secretary-General of NATO: Russia then held the worst of the Cold War.
On Thursday, the military alliances with NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commenting on the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stolenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
In 2014, however, due, in particular, to the continuing instability in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Mr Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not get worse.
As long as we are strong and as long as we can predict, we can have political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid further deterioration and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, said that the US-Russia relationship was even at a dangerous disadvantage.
Mr Trump urged to thank the country for its bad intermediary congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines because of the readmission experienced by car manufacturers.
One day before the announcement by Mr Aud, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350 000 cars.
The director of the BMWL said that he believed that 'there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the BMM home town, Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, David announced that it would make changes to the engines of Mercedes of over 3 million in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned the call-back.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been greatly marketed by European car manufacturers in order to achieve targets for CO2 emissions.
Emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions neutralising equipment will increase, and it will be difficult to price cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being behind large car companies and of ignoring the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, where Volkswagagen's cars reduced emissions to standard tests.
Many of the Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but directors are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the Aud motorway Development DG was arrested in Germany.
Zacchecheo Giovani is an Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was invoked in the criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which was suspected by the authorities that Audi had installed a system for recycling European emission requirements, based on similar investigations in the United States.
The Aud investigation could significantly undermine the position of Volkswagen: The manufacturer of cars is disproportionately large.
The vote in Venezuela began with a frank investigation, large demonstrations in permission.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuela authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion on firinges, which has no role to play in the election result, the chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Tibisay Lucas, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end.
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a delegation was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against change.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its demonstrations in such a way that they are under way at the time of appointment.
According to the El Papas, the national security forces began on Wednesday evening with local time to take over the country's parliament building.
The troops are meant to ensure that the appointment date is safe.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavintage.
He has become the symbol of the region of Provence in Southern France, but is now threatening climate change.
There had been a reduction in the number of drought and agents, and researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to this problem.
'Spring, and particularly in the autumn of Provence, is in fact threatened by the effects of climate change in the region of Provence, which has resulted in a clear reduction in the rain quantity of the spring and, in particular, in the autumn, ', says that the expert of the CRIPEP-AMD research institute in the agriculture of Provence.
"This reduces the life cycle.
Furthermore, drought has brought many small crops into the region that spread microbes'.
The stakes are hard.
Liquid oil attracts travellers, and it is also a very desirable component of drinking water and cosmetics.
Instead of 'lengthy houses and large flowers', we now have smaller flowers which are weak or less developed or which are completely missing ', Mr Christmas says.
'in other words, there are fewer and fewer parts of ethical oil '.
The solution is to be found by stepping up irrigation, by delaying the volatility of soil and by stimulating the mixture of Savan and water which protects plants, and by developing drought for sustainable varieties.
The murder of the journalist is an increasing threat in Mexico.
Once a weekly transmission of the Ridoctrine newspaper, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the Sinalo State.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routes.
The two experienced journalists are talking about which more secure one is: Leaving children home or admitting them to the supplier that was carried out in 2009.
Three words have been written by experts in the bad front of the coalition: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group, and evidence is not needed, findings and knowledge enough.
The title of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and suppliers who are suspected of being government or drug cartels on the wage lists is written on the table; they are criminals who make Mexico 's chaos a threat to life.
According to the Protection Committee of journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nietetetetetta took office in December 2012, 589 federal journalists have been subjected to attacks and threats.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardens, the founder of Rido, the journalist and the source of inspiration.
'The biggest error is to live in Mexico and be a journalist ', Mr Valdez wrote together many of his books about drug violence.
There is a deep need for him, even though he is present everywhere, to conceal the huge image of Mr Valdez 's eyes to the Middle Ages, which reads' justice ': The Kolev journalists, Aaron Ibra and Miam Ramirez, have fallen into Tashmil, which repairs the face of Valdez'.
Less than two months after the death of Mr Valdez, journalists are discussing their common tragedy, their nightmare, their dreams and fear of persecution.
In 2010, a federal public prosecutor was set up, especially in the case of journalists, but according to the Prosecutor 's Committee on the Protection of Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, only two charges have been charged so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime-related killing every year are brought to justice.
The Ridoctor journalists will continue to write about the violence in Sinalo, even though they are killed and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Mr Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
'We cannot count on anyone until we know why. '
Mr Valdez had left the delivery of Rido in the capital of the Länder in Culia from 15 to 5.17 p.m.
He had driven his red Tokyo only a couple of cards when two men stopped and forced him out of his car and shot twelve slaughterhouses, presumably in the name of the newspaper: Rido means twelve.
Ammunition was driven out by the Valdez car and travelled at the end of the journey.
Mr Valdez was 50s.
He was left with a daughter wives and two adults.
Rumours move quickly and fly freely in Culilia.
However, the death of Mr Valdez is being slowly reduced.
Sinao has been one of the most bloody battles in Mexico since the arrest and expulsion of Mr Guzman last year to the United States in January, and the competing groups want to fill the vacuum.
In the streets of Sinalo, someone or several people are shot to death on a daily basis, and the hushkits have corresponding dual hurdles of drugs which are larger than many households.
In a federal state on the coast, there is' peace 'when only one cartel manages ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Mr Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder leader of Rido, Mrs Ismail Boyrquez, who is 60s, feels guilty of not being able to protect her friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Mr Valdez.
In February, Rido published an interview between Dama Lopez, leading to a competing battle against the Guzmann boys.
Mr Guzmann 's boys could be angered by the emotion: The suspected clients bought every number of newspapers as soon as the newspaper became sales points.
Another error was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same track was attacked.
Mr Valdez was a legendary in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered to be a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had discovered so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid of his behalf.
He had made a long career in Norway when he decided in 2003 to set up a Ridoce with five colleagues, while the shares in the newspaper were sold at USD 50.
In Sinao, 'it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drugs problem', as Mr Boyrquez says.
In time, the newspaper began to feel bold and honest drinking, and its sales and revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers were buried in the newspapers by trawlers that nobody else dared to dare to publish.
Eight years after it was set up, Rido won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboet Prize for its renewal in Latin America.
In the same year, Mr Valdez received the prize of the International Protection Committee on the Protection of Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for his courage to monitor Mexico's drug trafficking without hindering.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
'I want to continue to live ', as he said when he receives the prize of the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
Drug trafficking is a 'lifestyle' in Sinao, Mr Valdez said in an interview with TV last October.
"The journalist must take on the task that he has - or appear to be stupid.
I do not want anyone to ask me where I was when I was killed - why did I not say what was going on? "
The staff of Ridoctor need Valdez - a scourge who fought like a doctor like a dock worker - who need a friend, who always received cheap and advice; they need a teacher who knew how to cope with it.
They were counting on his rhetoric.
He always used the black spot.
He was in an anti-journalist El Guayaybo bar and always sitting on the same table.
They are now wondering whether routine was in his fate.
The death of my colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their job and survive.
"Criminals do not like this if we deal with their women and children and their pure business activities, their secret drugs barriers.
They were excluded from the drink ', as Mr Borquez says.
At best this meant strong self-censorship and self-protection;
Confidence in its own intimidation.
If you feel that everything is not in order, you must remain absent.
The problem is, according to the journalist of Ridoctrine, Andrees Vivial, that 'the impression can be disappointed and that is what happened in the case of Javier'.
Old rules no longer apply in Sinao, nor do they apply in Tamalights, Veramar, Guerrusz and other federal states with dangerous networks: Attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
Mobile telephones were not allowed to be brought into the room where security training in Rido was held; a few days ago, it had become apparent that only government espionage programmes had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police had been sought to protect the wood from 40 000 hell.
The government of the Länder had ordered them to control the offices of Rido which are located in the four-floor building area of Culia.
Some of the journalists thought half of whether the two police were among the 50% that the Governor of the Länder did not consider to be reliable.
It has taken months since drug suppliers had been in mountain rural areas under control.
This week, the delivery of Rido planned three heads.
The volume of Nyrochipelago Cesvez's debt had been killed in Sinao.
The newspaper also revealed that government money had focused on the city of the Governor.
Furthermore, in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culia, only at the end of the public prosecutor 's office, a group of people had been kidnapped.
There was no official information about who was abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: Everyone in the city knew that the food was in favour of drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist has discovered in public documents that the food had been registered in the name of the ruling institutional revolution (Pri), which has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
The corruptors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have been widely publicised.
The journalist asked the journalist to write on previous cases in the same place, one of which was' El Chaheno 'Guzmann', which managed to flee and prevent the army from being solved.
For a few months now, the readers would have known that they would receive reliable information on the kidnapping of Valdez.
'We would have known what had happened in the past ', say' El Flaco '.
"Now all contacts with our sources of information are the exception."
Mr Valdez's working machine has been converted into a reserve to preserve cold and village against the persecution of journalists, who have had a new, unexpected task: They have become journalists in favour of freedom of the press.
The journalist, Miam Ramiez, has taken part in a demonstration from the local public prosecutor next morning, following a few villages, which was once again responsible for the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared in the Western Mitchanic State three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, the bodies incinerated by the authorities on the basis of DNAS tests were discovered.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, with the 'SOS Press' texts being produced in demonstrations.
Today, Mr Borquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for investigating the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Mr Valdez, he met with the Governor of Sinalo and accused the authorities of espionage and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has then asked for him to be removed from the government fat because he is concerned that he cannot be objective.
Mr Valdez has repeatedly said that organised crime is surrounded by journalists in Mexico, the authorities permitting crime and the indifferent society.
In its last book, Nararkov Valdez wrote that drugs gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in conjunction with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, over half the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
'Mexico is silent by killing people ', Mr Ramirez says.
Murders have a deteriorating effect.
Nobody forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Masci in the north of the border Tamallas six years ago.
The very nature of his bodies was the message signed by Zetasky: 'I am here for the sake of my writing'.
He dissociated himself from his cut off was the hunger of a computer and chickens.
Some newspapers have decided to end their activities, as the El Norte newspaper in the north of Chushku's border state has decided to do after the magnitude of the Breche.
Some people will continue to do so, as Nuvo Laredon El Mamana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on its front page to drug cartels: 'What do you want of us?'
Some journalists have fled from their federal states or from the country as a whole.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work on exile and the whole time has to be careful.
Sometimes, criminals looked for a journalist in their hands, as evidently happened with the photograph of Ruba Epol, who was murdered with four women in the residence of Mexico City by 2015, after having fled from Verator.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Mr Ibarra - who had to become a poet once - admittedly admits that writing from drug trafficking is frightening.
'I have become a journalist because Mexico is travelling to hell ', he says.
Some time ago, the journalists in Ridocus were sitting on Friday at midnight on the premise that the most recent number of newspapers had been completed, starting with a colourful message, for example.
19 people died in ammunition between competing tyres and security forces in Mazakhn.
The war was intensified, as promised in the signals of the cartel found in the region.
Journalists put the news on the website of Ridoce in their intelligent telephone.
The next day it was necessary to re-establish the site.
Siren can expand - yet another shooting point.
Mr Boohrquez would kick the police controlled by the supply:
If they were afraid, they were very well concealed.
The delivery of Ridoce continued the heritage of the murdered founder under this massive shaping in which the man seems to be the middle door to the whole of Sinao.
Mr Boyriez says that you cannot even consider putting an end to the operation; "how can I stop the press when our trainers asked to get to the streets on the same day that Mr Javier had been murdered?"
The Hannu Mann Olympic project began with a huge setback - 'The location'.
The celebrations of Hannu Mann, who spent 39 years, remained brief because the professional pilot began to prepare for the Olympic era.
However, the Haritisation period began catastrophic when Mann became ill in its flung.
It began with a long period of ill-treatment, which lasted to almost five weeks.
Integration took place practically wholly with the sick.
First there was a flung and, finally, a child's disease such as the replacement that I had to eat antibiotics.
I was only able to make the planned performance by 10%.
I do not recall when I have been fond of the last time.
It was a hard place when I was not allowed to benefit from training, Mrs Mann will report to Mrs Iltan.
The results of the test collapsed.
The World Cup for 2007 only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was reflected in the Sport and Tower Sport test of 12 June.
The sportsmen and women are squandering on the ground, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the journey will stay for around ten seconds and the testing will take the sportsman off the sportsman.
Last autumn, I spent 32 minutes on paint, but now I have only 28 minutes.
Mrs Mann tells us that this was the case.
We are moving in the right direction.
After the initial difficulties, Mrs Mann says that she has remained healthy.
I have made a number of peaceful, unexpected exercises in which I have tried to normalise the replacement of human body.
It is now a very good five-week period.
It was also a week and a half for flight holidays.
I have also had the opportunity to meet with my family.
In the last period, Mann only participated in four competitions before the Gulf Miss.
The best result was seen in the opening competition as soon as Mann became at the top of 18.
Guidelines
Mann and Petter Kuk, the Director-General of the Majesty, have drawn up a training and competition plan up until next February.
We are now looking for a different brake on training over the last few years.
After the club, Rullah would have the weekend of the three world cup.
In December, at least one world cup at the weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be included in Setheland.
Hopefully then the name will be found in the list of the Olympic Games, Mrs Mann will say.
The Olympic Games in Pyongang would have been the sixth winter Olympic Games in Mann.
The most important thing now is to keep healthy, Salt Lake City City 2002 has celebrated the nonsense of the nonsense.
Dinosaura protected its enemies by naïve hatred.
First of all, it seems to be a frightening statute.
Now the scientists have revealed the first results of the investigation into the size of the SARS identified by Canadian mining workers, which was so well maintained that experts call it Mona Li.
It had survived so well that researchers had even been able to define that its Finnish man was red red and had a 'problematic past'.
According to the Current Blokland, it has, for all time, been the best enforced dinosaurs and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The newly found fossil is a nineteenth sun, that is to say, the average age of 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this extremely astonishing phosphates to be an extremely important discovery.
According to the National Geographic newspaper, the most deployed vegetable cancer has been the preservation of a fossil in its species all the time.
It was found at the Sunchor Millenium mine in Canada in northern Albert, between 21.11 and 2011, and the Shawn Funk was a mining man.
He was able to do something that seemed not to be a natural component of the expenses surrounding him and decided to look into his findings more closely.
The phosphates found in cancellation were sent to the Royal Pacrimoriological Museum of Tyrrer.
For six years, the deception was taken out of one hundred kilos of housing.
Hard work is now being seen.
"If you mutilate your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping" you say a scientist, Calb Brown, who works as a researcher in the King of Tyrrel.
"It remains in scientific history the Mona Lille, one of the most beautiful and most retained dinosaurs.
After all, the investigations made it clear that dinosaurs eating meat were probably a major threat to this plant breast, even though it had a tanker, and it reminded us of a wretched tank.
Its red-white tank is shattered by its fishermen, and it would also protect us from a more frequent and more electoral battle that still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to confuse its environment and avoid greater dinosaurs.
110 million years old nineteenth rose in May and is now on samples in the Royal Pacrimoriological Museum in Tyrol.
The scientists have given it the name of Borealophol to Mark Mitchell: Mitchell belonged to a tie of over 7 000 hours of dinosaurs.
Mr Nodox has remained so amazing that Mitchell and the international researchers have been able to determine the imagination and form of its bodies.
They discovered that it was still protected in the animal world by a general battle in which the body is more up and more electoral.
The observation was surprising, however, because Borealia is considerably higher than the current animals with the corresponding frustration.
One can conclude from this that dinosaurs eating the meat catch to the extent that the horse favoured survival as a means of concealing rather than fighting.
The current animals, for example, with euros, seasons and armaments, have the same colour, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, which indicates that nucleus was also seriously threatened.
The catch of the 'great, heavily targeted dinosaurs' tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs were, as Mr Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of the Nodox River reveals that its brain was red.
Scientists are continuing to investigate the nineteenth career in order to draw conclusions from its life, for example, they are examining the content of their fate in order to see what they are doing in their last meal.
Scientists believe that they died of a river dying and driven to the sea where they suffer from their seas.
Albert was as close as it is today in Florida and rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
"This nineteenth sunshine is very important because its female beef has been preserved and has also remained tripartite in its original form" Mr Brown says.
"That is why it seems almost the same as in the early term.
To outline it does not require much imagination: If you sleep a little of your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping.
Lithuania was the era of steel dioxins, massive twin-track dinosaurs with meat.
Although their King, Tyrankanosourus rex, that is, millions of years before Borealopae, their great predecessors could have exposed this tangible Dinosa.
For example, the predecessors of the Tyrannanososeurs rex, for example, included the Acrocanthrax, a monster of around 1.5 metres long.
The most recent discoveries of researchers in the Nodox have been published in the Current Blokland believe that Borealopia was awakened after death and mutilated in other ways.
It was found at the Sunchor Millenium mine in Canada in northern Albert, between 21.11 and 2011, and the Shawn Funk was a mining man.
According to museum, it has remained the world's best entanced from the death of dinosaurs and tanks in London.
On average, the scourge was five metres long and weighed up to 1 300 kg.
Two half metres of their sheep suffer.
Researchers believe that this tangible vegetable cancer travelled through the current West Canada until the floods transported it to the open sea.
Its tank has remained minor details in the marine butter.
Its falsified residues have remained so well that its bovine hemp still remains in the photograph of the tank.
Michael Gresho wrote in the National Gemac that such conservation is' as rare 'as a triumph.
The more precise it thinks, the more astonishing it seems.
There is still a fosic of fosic in its teachers.
Its right preference is in its village, five out of five.
I am also able to calculate the basis for it.
How does one activist learn to answer the question: Who is the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked at 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day ago, St, from Louise and sitting on the radius of his airbnabinet in the Facebo telephone.
He then discovered the message on his embryonic blood:
"The police killed the young person of the age of 18 and his bodies are still on the streets."
He was confused to note that nobody else had posted the same information on his eating, which is why he also closed Facebo and opened Twietre.
In his time there were a number of rewells from the user, Theedeah.
The title is St: The black Brown in Fergusson in Fergusson, who lived in Louise, had been shot in the real time by the dead of Michael Brown, a white policeman who had shot unarmed in Fergusson in the Fergusson state of Misski.
The user in question had also posted the picture of Mr Brown 's unsolicited body in the street, where it was left for four hours.
'It is incredible ', Mr Ferrel thought.
But the death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitein later this evening, he was told that people would be accessing Canfield Drivine.
Users posted pictures of the police's closing-up and funeral, as well as Mr Brown's father himself, who said in the villages: 'The Fergusson police have just killed my unarmed son!'
Ferrell followed the real video, in which the police stood in front of the demonstrators with a picture of dogs.
He also tells us that he had seen a video in which one police disguised his fault and sleep: 'I meet all of you...'
'There is no normal ', Mrs Ferrel will recall that she has said.
"It is not the murder we have already used to and could be described as typical.
At that time, I felt cold colours.
I was angry and I was also. "
He reserved a return home for the next day.
The machine landed at eleven evening, Ferrell went to search for the trust of its six-year-old daughter and decided that they would go to Fergusson next morning.
What happened to Mrs Ferrer and Mr Fergusson over the next nearly three years has been documented 'Whop Street', which received its first-hand film teachers from 18.2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss and strength and persistence from the point of view of the local people who left to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell driven Fergusson towards the flop and the daughter who has fallen into line with it, they re-visited the debate on what is to be found in black and under what conditions they had spoken on countless occasions before that morning.
'It is when I told you how black people have had to fight for what they believe they have said to their daughters' Ferrel remember.
'We are going to Fergusson because the police killed the 18th-year-old son and that is not right '.
'I could not fail to take my daughter ', Mrs Ferrel said later.
'The events of today are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter is entitled to know and grow.
He must be able to activate and organise his life, but he must also know what we need to do to liberalise and liberalise ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still like other black girls.
It seems to me that I would harm him if I were to protect him from reality. "
Their first stop at Fergusson was South Florinet Road, who is against the police, who became a camp of activists when they were waiting for information about the case and finally found out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
There, Mrs Ferrel and her daughters went to help the local entrepreneurial who made lunch packages.
They were forced into bullets and distributed to demonstrators.
Ferrel began to take a new approach to the activists.
'Aktivist changed completely after 9 August, 'he says,' when he learned at the University of Missourski St, in Lourel was chairman of the organisation of nurses belonging to minorities, when he focused on the right to food and health differences in black communities.
'I had no experience of organisational organisation.
It has happened in some way. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the assistant of Sah Fola in a night demonstration.
Mrs Fola said that she and Mrs Lucas Alvradrakis-Farrar simply wanted to say 'what was happening.
Mrs Ferrell's memory was hit by doubt: 'Do you really want to tell us what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use?'
The suspicion was the countless times that people had come into the local community, usually white people, who simply wanted to benefit from their difficulties and persistence.
'We have heard that the birth and birth of Fergusson had no common voice ', a recent interview by Mrs Fola,' We wanted to do things differently '.
Fola had already contacted Damon David, a assistant who is familiar with his dead prisoners.
The David Administration led Ferrer to take part in the project, together with six other local authorities, following events in the years following the fall of Mr Brown.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us," Mr Daviis says.
'I was most concerned with the way in which local people are presented in film, because I am presented in the same way '.
According to Mrs Fola, the intention was not to focus on the experiences of Mrs Ferrell, who wanted to show that 'the people movement is not a magic leader but a Community', but that Ferrell proved to be the most open to describe.
That is why the documentation seems surprisingly surprising on the private side of the life of Ferrell, such as love and marriage.
'I felt quite exhaustive ', Ferrell laughing when he said what it seemed to have been seen for the first time.
'but I understand that this work and the human image of black people require a certain amount of vulnerability '.
In addition, the Ferrell story once and again brings the role of black quereeze women in the wider Black Likes Matter movement.
The movement was born in the social media, after the police had shot a black theatre in Tray Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement are the same as queternity identity.
The leadership of 'black quereter women' has maintained the entire movement ', Ferrell says,' because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queterans have had to endure everything. "
I agree with Mrs Fola: 'The movement is in fact maintained by black women, including a large number of queue women'.
He underlines, however, that Ferrell was not chosen for documentation because of his querial identity.
"He won the energy movement", Fola says.
'It is no coincidence, however, that she was in the front line; black quereer women live at many points and have a lot of fears.
His energy is transmitted from the white fish. "
The description teams have long submitted Mr Fergusson, but the Community and the police are still tired.
Ferrer still has two and a half years left of conditionality, and he was sentenced to blocking the motorway in the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate of his home fabric is short and concise: 'Confused'.
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned out three years ago in the streets of Fergusson:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to overcome.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our coffee. "
A suitable consensus: Artists create shapes on the DNA of Chella Mann.
In New York, faces - white, black and cluster faces - have been plunged into the middle of an exhibition in Fridmania, which can be detected in a more accurate way.
These thirty works are the shapes of the artist, Heathher Dejung-Haglag, based on the DNA samples from Chela Mann's postal and Hungarian.
Mann sent evidence of the prison of Fort Leavenworst in which he carried out his 35-year sentence, sentenced to secret the leaking of diplomatic electricity on the Wiki Leaxis website.
At 2.8.17 p.m, the Dewealth-Hang A Beeling Resemnance was opened.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Deweyborg-Hag and Mann, which links the technology, information technology and art in its work: Mann is a tranche and a pioneering dissident, whose prison sentence relied on the third day of his mandate.
Dewealthy-Hagong analyses the DNA algorithly and created 30 shapes on the basis of his gene data, which are steady, albeit somewhat theoretical, position on the wording of DNA data, on the causes of ambiguity and interpretation, as well as on identity.
Chlesa Mann, its name Bradley Edward, has openly told us that he had been in the same position since the race, who was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including infringements of the law on espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Mann, convicted in prison: A baric, white clean-bloodshed in which the laborious conditions of Mann sit in the car are sitting on the driver's site; in the final analysis, he has a cancellation which became the hallmark.
In 2015, the Dewel-Hagogorg project had received a great deal of support from the Stang Visos project, which he implemented in 2012.
He created photographs on the basis of criminal information, which he received from DNA, for example, on smoking and unloading, and created pictures of what the people concerned could have shown.
The artist then received e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They challenged Chlessea Mann and needed a picture", Mrs Deweg-Hagbourg told us a new exhibition at the information conference.
Mrs Mann's character was unable to visit or could not be described in prison, so the newspaper contacted Celinna and asked whether she would be interested to make Mann an image of DNA.
They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even jointly carried out the Sakharov Imagarie book, which Shoie Kanungo described, describing the future of a future in which the President would have alleviated the judgment in Celessia and would have the opportunity to look at the exhibition.
In reality, Obamar reduced the Mann judgment just a few days after the publication of the Sarchitecture book, which was fortunate coincidence after seven years of imprisonment in a nation-based military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition should be opened at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against information-gatherers and corporate soldiers and is inviting new ways of strengthening the strong divisions he had to alleviate in Twie.
Mrs Deweyweg believes that 'everything has its purpose'.
The Gallerian wall has the artist 's opinion and, behind it, the great Mann' s appointment, which is at the heart of the name, calls for the end of the 'automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture'.
The opposite is the case with the DNA period in Mann: The long quantity of CMs, Gs and APA books in lead villages.
This combination of 200 letters - or nuns, as the scientific definition used by the artists is - wants to show how similar we are all, at least our biology.
'I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations', Mrs Deweyweyant-Hagbog says, and that the exhibition also reflects her Sruius Memores video from 2007.
'DNA tells us a lot of stories: 30 of them are on the agenda '.
The final work of this exhibition is in its own room: The website of the Mann-Deweyng Sarchitecture.
In the case of Mann, the hemp is stepping up in prison like King Kong, in the hand of my megaf.
"If they have been silent, they have won", the description says.
'We will never be silent '.
'The text is the letter I received from Mann ', the artist from Philadelphia.
'It is so impressive that I still get cold colours'.
Unlike the sarcely description, Mann has not yet seen an exhibition and, when Mrs Mann is here, she welcomed the faces based on her own genetic knowledge as well as the number of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition.
That is deliberate, as all the others have done in this exhibition: For example, the Mann DNA period has been written in a lead-maker for a card which is the same as his surge (157.5 Cm).
'the faces were in the past on the wall, but I wanted to bring a number of people to know them ', Mrs Deweg-Hagog says.
'I wanted to describe the mass movement that was created in Celinna, which was also behind his release '.
The professor of the University of Northwege and Oxford's university professor are being searched for murder in suspects.
The police tells us that they have started looking for the municipalities to find a university professor of Northsweg and Oxford university suspected of a man dying in a chicken housing.
Documents from the Cook House show that arrest warrants were issued on Monday on Wyndham Lathemen, 42 and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornelelli-Durant, which had been issued without the possibility of being free from any guarantee.
According to the documents, Mr Cornellley-Durant, 26, died after having been fed several times.
According to the local information published by the Chicago police, the bodies were found on 27 and 7.2017.
The police officers who were interrupted in the Grand Plaza House found a victim who had a number of hostilities in his bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornelli-Durant was said to be dead on the ground and two suspects are being investigated.
Lathem has been working as an assistant in microbiology and immune logic since 2007 at the University of Nortighter.
The Deputy Commander for Social Relations in the University, Alan K. Cubbbage, said in his statement that Lathem is now in administrative freedom and is denied access to the struggle of the Northweweg University.
"This is a criminal offence that the authorities are investigating and the Northwege University is helping to investigate", Mr Cubbage wrote.
Warren is working as parents at the Oxford University of Financial Administration.
The opinion sent by the University and Sommer College by e-mail says' we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are prepared to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible '.
It also stated that Mr Warreen's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he will be abandoned.
Anthony Guglieli, the head of information of the Chicago police force, said that he would urge the suspects to give them serious attention.
'the police have an idea of their location and we are constantly clarifying our search for them ', Mr Guglieli.
According to Mr Guglililieu, local, regional and national authorities help in search of suspects.
He told us that the police had received a telephone from the hostages of the Grand Plaza building who had obtained a vague suggestion that something had happened in the housing of 108.
The police described it as terrible.
According to Mr Guglililivius, it is doubtful whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or before.
He said that cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
'We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship ', Mr Gugli says.
The Grand Plazan Executive Board published the following information to the inhabitants: 'The police are currently investigating what is happening and the background to the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence'.
The man threatened to block the Islamic book trade and 'kill Muslims' in London.
'I am not an anthrax, I am Catholic ', said to the police.
The Moffak must carry out a hundred hours' unpaid social service.
A 390s-old man was convicted of his threats to block the Islamic book trade in London and 'kill all Muslims'.
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moffet was condemned, among other things, for serious harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by the staff of the book trade on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had 'threatened to block the trade in books and kill Muslims'.
The suspects left trade after threats.
Mr Moffet was caught up when he fought the police for threats.
The threat was not related to the events of the book trade.
The authorities noticed that Moffet had fallen in the same way as suspected of the events of the book trade, the police scientist said.
I am not an anthrax, I am Catholic, Mr Moffetti, said to the police in the course of interceptions.
The punishment must be for a man to carry out a hundred hours' unpaid social service and to pay EUR 620 pumps, that is, the legal costs of approximately EUR 690 and the compensation of the victims, that is, of EUR 95.
According to the Scotland Yarad scientist, a number of offences of hatred are not reported.
'WADA's road map will be completed in the near future '- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Musta?
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Vitanen Musta, has said that Russia will shortly complete its efforts under the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSA.
"Some of the measures taken in accordance with the road map have already been implemented, and the RUSA was entitled to plan and test in collaboration with the UKAD.
The WADA's road map has been updated in this respect, 'Dr Musta said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADO road map, which lays down the conditions for restoring the powers of the RUSA, recently published on the website of the organisation.
I think that it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
'everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to the WADA in the near future, 'We have added.
One of the points of the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by the WADO, Richard McLarenen, a Canadian lawyer, who is examining the state's allegedly contribution to the doping of Russian sport.
That is what Mr Mussa said: 'Research is under way because our anti-doping system has recognised failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist. "
What Mr Mutina said was that the President of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission, Mr Vitally Smirnnnnovovv, was fantastic.
On the same day, the Russian sporting media, Mr Smirnikov, spoke to the RSport media, recognised that there were problems with Russian anti-doping bodies, "we have said on several occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
We are not going to vote in favour of the report unconditionally, but he added.
WADA ordered RUS Adoping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scale of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
Following a visit, the leader of the WADAP, Olivier Niggna, visited RAmerican DAD in July in Moscow, who said that the organisation was on the right path to restore powers.
The British organisation is sceptical about radical innovation for Finns: 'There is no evidence of the health benefits of electric packaging'.
The British organisation is suspected of the benefits of Finnish maternity packaging.
BC and Guardian, for example, say that Lully Trust, which is fighting caged death, prohibits the use of its own prospectuses in maternity packaging in Britain.
The distribution of electoral packaging for all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lusuby trusts, there is no evidence that maternity packaging would reduce the risk of cash death.
Extinction death means an inexplicable sudden death.
Lully Trust is an expert from the British health authorities in the field of a child's safe dream.
We will no longer allow our official prospectuses to be thrown out of them because it would give the impression that we recommend this product, the organisation informed it.
Finland has one of the world's lowest reading of child mortality, only two thousand dead.
According to Lusuby trusts, a good chapter in Finland is the result of a number of reasons, such as the low level of theatre pregnancy.
Giving each family a box could be one factor.
But that cannot be said, as Mr Francine Bates said.
We are concerned about maternity packaging being marketed as products that reduce child mortality and caged death.
Electoral packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
Packaging contains various supplies, such as child clothes.
This year there are 53 products in packaging.
Packaging itself is the worst box to which a child can be fed to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, its divided boxes meet all safety standards.
Lusuby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for bad boxes.
According to Lusuby trusts, packaging can be the best alternative to sleep if there is no framework or supermarket.
The organisation recommends that packaging be used only for everyday life and that it stop using it when a child is able to reverse.
The organisation also recommends to keep pet animals out of the packaging and to ensure that they do not grow or wind.
Once again, the chicken rose from a Japanese animal fatty.
The Japanese animal husbandry is looking for a knife.
It has surprised staff at their speed and has already expelled again in two weeks' time.
On Tuesday morning, the knife of Shibukawan in Western Japan rose.
The coast revealed that the cure was left by the head.
It will not die straight away because it eats the grass surrounding the animal fodder, but we are very concerned, Mr Yoshi Yamai, who is working in animal floods.
A 35th-year-old cancer is married, 550s and around a metre long.
Your country describes the caricature as silent and laudable.
In times of age, the cancer is allowed to move freely in the area of anger.
The animal scourge has not been discovered in the eyes of a kilogram.
The previous Koan map occurred in the other week.
They went down the road of 150 metres away from the animal farce.
I noticed that on the way to animal farce.
I raised my car and asked my fellow Members to help, Mr Yamar.
It will be able to walk more quickly than we could ever imagine.
These scandals help to avoid the mistakes of Uberi.
Mrs Erret wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in her network-trading company, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the workers were sceptical about them.
'The questionnaires were simply neither consistent nor objective ', Mrs Erret tells us: Madison, as a carelessness company, is concentrating on network trade, with 75 employees.
Mrs Erret decided to use external aid.
More and more new companies have been put on the market by the staff administration to help other companies find out how their employees can be.
They develop and add software to measure the commitment of workers, companies which can carry out questionnaires and deal with certain road and population groups and provide anonymous notification services for their workers and, in some cases, direct contact with the government.
"Self-health can be monitored by applications such as Strana and Fitis, but where is the delay in measuring the commitment of employees" in Redwood and City?
Mrs Erret has been using the Glin software for three years, telling us that she has had an even more in-depth view of the ideas and feelings of her employees.
The programme can make quick questionnaires and votes on certain roads, and it can produce a map which can see in which departments the workers are most dissatisfied and the weakest assessments of which directors have received.
Companies have understood that they must monitor the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uberi, and that the haulier around the haulier has since wrote in their Blokland from a culture in which workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For scandals such as Glin, such abuses are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a worldwide area of activity which, according to Let's's website, can increase to over USD 18.7 billion by 2020.
In Denvy, Converncient, a federal state of Coldra, is a scandal that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate use, an interest in the company increased earlier this year, when Uberi's reputation came to the test.
Conversion has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Teysla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uberi.
Like Mrs Glin, it allows companies to carry out collected questionnaires, collect responses in real time and map out problem areas.
Furthermore, workers can declare irregular behaviour to be irreversible by means of a message of text.
And if the leader should be suspected of irregularities, complaints go directly to the government of the company.
"Public opinion has removed the authorities", says the founding fathers of the Convergenesis and Mr Patrick Quinn.
He reminds us that, if a company treats its employees badly or unethically, the consequences may be expensive, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can begin to boycott a company, and they can also lose workers and face a challenge to justice.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25 000 workers in the food chain at 500 stages, a company which has used Converge for over a year, because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily connected with the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that, if a worker wanted to announce the problem, he had to clarify the telephone sea or an e-mail address which was able to make a notice in the Directorate-General, then he had to make an official complaint and hope it will be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience", to say, 'Yames Vitrano, the Director of Law in Ruby, who said that it was difficult to follow the complaints made by the workers.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from the leaders in another city or federal state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
'I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive idea of the reality of the worker ',' says Vitrano, which is leading to the Ruby Tutsddam risk management team.
"At the same time, we shall protect our shareholders from legal proceedings in the field of labour relations."
According to Qaeda, companies began to take ethics, values and the commitment of workers more seriously after the collapse of Athur Andersen as a result of unethical action in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only through the social media that companies realised that they could no longer hinder public accounting.
'hope was used as a strategy before technology became controlled by ethics'.
Glin and Converent offer their software as a service which is regularly charged.
It is a business model that is acceptable to investors, it is an opportunity that both Glin and Convergenesis have to support capital investors.
In February, Convergent collected USD 10 million from companies such as Saphurhire and Tola Captle, which have collected capital of USD 47 million.
In November, Glin received EUR 10 million from Besser boat from Partnership and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investment is not surprising, given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, workers expect more of their jobs.
In a competitive market such as the Pibro, good salaries are high, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and give their time to a genuinely useful undertaking.
'The workers are more committed to the success of the company if they are flourishing in a company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding ', says that the leader of LindIn, which is responsible for rewarding and prosperity.
Investors will be able to make a profit when companies are successful, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves to doing so.
The third party 's academic tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is not surprising that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the Culture of Culture in Culture, information on the commitment of workers is important;
But that is pointless if measures are not taken.
If a company asks its employees to return, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if there is no change, or nothing else, then disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If four thousand proposals are requested, then we must be prepared to hold four thousand debates", to say that the director-general of Kotter International, Russell Rath, who has seen too much confidence in companies simply collecting information.
"If a company does not take measures, workers will start to wonder whether they were consulted.
And do they have any meaning?
If they do not care, why should they care about the company? "
According to the Erret, Madison is currently carrying out personnel questionnaires monthly and capable of addressing the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glin.
Once Mrs Erret had collected the feedback on the slowness of the decision-making process and the quality of communications from frustrated workers, she was able to make changes to the roads and to organise communications training to resolve the problems.
Mr Ruby Tuespo is more aware of his employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an area of activity that is known to be a great variety of workers.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers", Mr Vitrano says.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
Without customers, there are no companies'.
In Sweden, the 20th-year-old man is suspected of describing his unmarried neighbour, the news office TT.
The woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the sleep when he had discovered his window out of the window.
According to a woman, the downstream was described as housing.
The woman who had died in the weather had died into another room.
When a woman had arrived to check the situation, it was first a window of window, but soon the window has been reclassified.
A suspected 20-year-old man has admitted that he has described women.
He claimed, however, that he had only described women's faces.
The video described in the late had been removed and the police failed to restore it as proof.
In the questionnaires, the man has admitted that he has committed a crime.
The man of his funeral was justified by saying that he love his neighbour 'quite mad'.
According to TV, a news office is prosecuted against a man.
Teachers are calling for further breakthrough in the autumn negotiations.
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but should be reduced, as Olli Lusaka, President of the OAJR, said on Thursday.
The temporary cutting of public holidays highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility of concluding agreements which do not in any way involve holiday cuts.
In the realm sector, contracts will only come into being once private sector papers have been signed and interest rates made clear.
It is predictable that, for example, the OAS working conditions have been agreed in January.
Mr Lusaka has not yet revealed his objectives.
It is also the Chairman of the trained public negotiation organisation, Jukan.
Sudden: Monetary cutbacks increase the disparities in the development of credit.
According to the OAS, the statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public employees is deteriorating while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the utopian philosophy, a fixed-term cut in holiday holidays will further exacerbate the disparities in merit development.
Finland must determine how many pupils per teacher can be.
The OAS also points out that equality of basic education must be guaranteed, because the differences between the best and the weakest are growing.
According to the organisation, the results of learning are deteriorating and the differences between pupils and regions are increasing.
Brushkuini players for a long time, when NCAA reduced daily practitioners from two to one.
The night will soon be eleven; a number of UCLA players have been left in the battle on the other side of the new platforms.
Some of them have dismantled their players, who are flourishing after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few minutes, this drinking skill is a midday.
The players studying at the university's summer courses will return, after three hours of training, to the housing company to read the final experiments and next morning they will meet from half the seventh football centre in Wassimimann.
'The next three days will be tough on these streets', Mr Mora, Mr Brush 's spokesman, says a little before Monday' s exchange of Tuesday.
The Joint Undertaking organisation reduced the number of daily training times from two to two, the aim of which was to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final tests are being carried out.
That is why the first three UCLA exercises began over seven evening, and it was difficult to find a place for players already in full timetables.
Limiting the number of invoices to one day means that there is more than before, almost a week ago this year, and this is the first time in the literature of Westwood, which has been going on through Moran, while there are also summer courses.
This is to take place 18 times before 20 August, when the real preparation for the opening-up of the period begins: UCLA (Texas A) in September; the University of Mount Texas A.
Mr Mora says that he supported the amendment of the Statute of NCA, even though it made the deadlines for players even stricter.
'We are burdening them a great deal for three or four days, and that is a very challenging ', Mr Mora.
"But the players are prepared to work.
I believe that this will make things easier when we get to Saturday, and then we will have more time.
UCLA closes off activities after the outsiders, which is not easy, given the direct prospect of an area of closure and of Lusska Clash, a high-level hotel which has already been bombed over football flights.
Brush players are due to change the hotel at the weekend, but Mr Mora admits that problems can arise during the period when bad weather is available outside.
'We have security arrangements', Mr Mora says.
'The concern is that people can reserve a room and describe video from it, which is not an exaggerated concern.
Quite a lot of the video described by Mr Harbour is paid for.
But we have the guards there and the stopping area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to make too much effort.
We have a plan '.
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections will take place on Friday in Central African Rwanda, where the winner is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing his third term of office, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel RPF stopped the genocide organised by extremists.
We were the RPF commander.
Kagama has been criticised, among other things, for breaking up the opposition and limiting the freedom of expression.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Cagah will be able to work because the Constitution that has been blocked by the presidency has been amended for two years.
In Rwanda, however, we are also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, social reforms have taken place in Rwanda and international investment has been flow.
Furthermore, Kagama has played a major role in combining a country that is divided into genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, the Kaghdad has also promised more freedom for its people since the country has been raised on its feet.
It could be a good time to start.
Facebok is fighting currencies by stepping up the verification of facts.
Mr Facebov intends to send more and more potential currencies to independent inspectors and to present the results under the original article, which was announced by the world's largest social network on Thursday.
On its website, a company published an opinion that it is beginning to use up-to-date machinery learning to identify currencies, which could be sent to the inspectors of fax and which could be published under the original article.
Mr Facebo has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of the currency, many of whom think that the American presidential elections had an impact in 2016.
This topic has emerged from a political debate in Europe where the French electorate was bombed with currencies before the May presidential elections and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to finalise social media networks without delay.
On Thursday, Mr Facebov announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the verification of fax was tested in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
'people want to see which infections do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors, and they also want more background information so as to be able to decide more clearly what they read and distribute ', Mr Sara Su wrote in the block of the company.
He added that Mr Facebok will continue to test the relevant articles and will make other changes to his news to reduce the number of currencies.
A sarch book has been produced: The story of a birth.
A little Scotney in the county of Kenin is now known as Squez's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hidden place in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has 700 years of storm history, however, and now, in the watchful presence of the Beell river, this bird is the subject of the Sarapeaker book written by Jamie Rhodes, the author of the old documents with mophiliacs.
'I think it is a good thing to have a look at the text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago ', Mr Rhodes says that he is a nice thing.
'I have a personal connection when I conceal the letter in my hand '.
The Rhode book, the A Castle in England, tells the families of the families who lived in Scotte for the mediaeval period, which has been characterised by a different artist, a promising British sarchitect: Isac Lenewicz, Brion Milliam Smith, William Exley, Beky Palmbey or Isabel Genberg.
This is not the first book by Mr Rhodei, who, in 2014, appeared from Dead Men 's Teth and Otter Stevener, whose source of inspiration was the documents of the British national library, a project which was well known.
'I was cynical when I discovered the clubs in the letter, which had written the twin agents working for distribution in the 17th century ', Mr Rhodes tells me.
"That was his finger!
And letters come from the cigarette because the literature was used at that time.
Three centuries later, that importer will feel that he is on the ground.
I love the archives! "
A writer exporting to the old documents was allowed to live on a holiday with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Trust Council, which seemed too good to be true, and he admits that he did not have a little longer than would have been desirable.
He spent the days examining the wild 'new' birds, archives, archives, blocks and rare sites, such as chickens fed up in the centuries.
He fought the old holidays with ruins and accounts and discussed with foresters, wood breeders and sometimes also with the artists who describe the book.
Tonight he 'took whisky and started to write'.
The closer history of Scottney is fairly unknown, as the birth was only completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation after the last literature, Elizabeth Hussey, will die in 2006.
When Mr Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation had only just begun to go through the architecture, and Mr Rhodes tells us that the archives had been held for centuries by the same method: By exporting everything to the test.
The archives had daily books, letters from the time and maps of the English empire as to who owned anything, 'one might imagine that the land disputes are daughter', Mr Rhodes says, 'whereas families were even killed by one hour.
It was remembered that it would be an excuse to be '.
Some of the stories in the book are progressing from birth to history, as The Labourer is telling us about the man who will soon be joining the birthplace after the bird was completed in 1381.
'King Familes of Kent and Sussex 'states that the bird was in 1380', Mr Rhodes says.
'The British Catalonian rebellion began in the same region and reminded us that the captain can start from mechanical.
Perhaps these events are linked? "
The other story of the books is closely related to the history of the bird, such as The Priest, to the priest that was concealed by the family of Darrel for seven years during the English cleansing.
Smugler again tells the smugglder of the seventeenth century, Arthur Darrel, who is said to have flouted his funeral by filling his funeral in the architecture (as we saw many years later when his baby was opened).
Darrel is Rhode's favoured family in Scotney: 'The men of the family seem to have been a great deal of veterans; they have constantly had to get into debt and buy things that they would not have been able to afford.
The Darrel men solved their debt problem by going to women with older women who are wealthy, and I see them as beautiful stretchers who were able to slip the carrier '.
Now Mr Rhodes is seeking new written experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a Sarchitecture book on the Emperor, a paradox at the beginning of the twentieth century, which is now only a refined liquid.
There is a special place on the Scotney birth.
'It was sad to leave there ', he says.
"I would not have liked to go back to this horrific."
The worst then waged the Cold War in Russia.
On Thursday, the military alliances with NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commenting on the NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stolenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
In 2014, however, due, in particular, to the continuing instability in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Mr Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not get worse.
As long as we are strong and as long as we can predict, we can have political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid further deterioration and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, said that the US-Russia relationship was even at a dangerous disadvantage.
Mr Trump urged to thank the country for its bad intermediary congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitsky will stop - the temptation against Anthony Jospo will not happen.
Vladimir Klitsky will end his career.
On Thursday morning, the Ukrainian Klitsky, 41, announced its decision.
In the Atlantic Olympic Games, the invaded Klitsky, 69 times a profession, won 64 matches.
He was in possession of the various Miss between 2002 and 200615.
He lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyon Fury identified him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshstan met Anthony Joshun in Wemny stadiur stadiums and lost eleventh hurricane after the Hungarian match.
Joshua and Klitshire were expected to meet in a funeral in Las Vegalia in November.
However, Mr Klitsky did not find a reproach.
I was deliberately using a few weeks to make a decision in order to get enough distance from the Wememitley match, as Mrs Klitsky said in her communication.
As an amateur and professional church, I helped everything I dreamt of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful cabinet.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at the Klitshire's explanatory statement for its decision on video.
Klitshire continental agent Bernd Bönte stated in a report that the decision to end was difficult for Klitsky.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, as Mr Bönte said.
Since 2009, Mr Klitsky has been following an American player with Mr Haysen.
Paris has a child, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshire's big brother, Vitsky, is also a former World Cup of Racism.
Between 2008 and 12 brothers managed the various Missile federations at the same time.
The Finnish weather suffers from the circumstances: 'Export'.
Minina Nicole has suffered from the circumstances during the summer's external railway.
Minina Nicosia has had problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cynicism have taken women out of the female profile.
Even in London, there are unstable circumstances.
Mina Nicole is talking about savings.
The conditions have been in place in this light against Minina Nicole.
I do not want to blame the line, but it was inconceivable that I did not get even a little mixture to move properly, as Mr Nicholson said after the Insbruck.
I have competed and worked here for how many times, and I have never experienced the same variable wind in this place, as Mr Nicole said in Papuo Nurin Games.
It has been very difficult to stabilise the smile during this period, when there have also been such unstable winds, Mr Nicole said that the King is starting.
On Thursday, London spoke.
The time has come to get technology right - whether it is cold or not.
It has been cold and wind, and it has taken the fiasco.
It makes no sense to spend energy in a bad light.
Thanks to 455, he got his head on the Miss.
445 out of the world has gone.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
We must be moderate and wait for better winds.
The aim is to exceed Friday's map by 460.
Why is it that they are treating abroad?
That is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I had a sleep and technology stagnating.
Surely we should have done the same now.
Normally, we have been able to exercise control, now we have had to adhere to it.
What would be the ideal cup?
25% of the average.
A small wind will also take place as long as it is stable.
The experienced extra-official daughtened politicians in Yley: 'We have no room for division now or for many years'.
In spite of the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sikhai must remain rigid and guard against the cancellation of the State's budget by means of debt, warn the Finance Minister of the budget for decades prepared by Erkki Virankosen.
He says that there is no room for division.
Mrs Jle challenged Wednesday morning, which was retired from Viranta in 2015.
The country's budget for next year is starting.
Recently, two political proposals have been put forward, such as the increase in the guarantee pension, the reduction of car tax and the promotion of electoral cycles by Mr Virankoski.
They are mainly telling us that the elections are about to take place because, when 10% of the state budget is financed by an additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I even think it is a fraud to talk about the distribution of debt, as Mr Virankosen said.
Mr Virankoski stressed that all debt is indebted to children.
The Vitanen has had a long experience of preparing the state budgets: He began in 1978 as Secretary of Budgets and then worked as DG Administrative and Budget Director.
Last time, before retirement, he was the Chief of the Ministry of Employment and Industry.
In an interview, Mr Virankosen pointed out that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasts think that this is a gap that will be set aside as early as next year and Finland is waiting for 1% growth for decades.
Washington will change the rules for a permanent residence permit.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that the rules of a permanent residence permit, the Greenland Cardump, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten up the requirements of temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars from taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens in other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
According to the media, Mr Trump, the applicants who are able to live English and who have the skills to benefit our economy will benefit from the new process.
The half of the Danish Queen does not want to be buried with the Queen.
Prince Henrick does not want to be buried with King Margarea.
The phrase 'Prince Henrik and Queen Marggee' was described in April.
The Danish Queen Margarea, 77, and the Polish prpro-Henrie, 83, does not bury one another, tells the Danish door.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The House has today indicated that the priest, Henrik, does not want to be buried in the Rosska Church, the door says in its communication on Thursday.
According to the BTTV, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the prprprprprprprprprprprprprprime in the UK family.
It is no secret that the priest has been dissatisfied with his role and enlightened in a Danish monarchy, the Head of Chancellor of Communication, Mr Le Beelly, made a comment in the newspaper.
The decision not to bury him alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of the fact that he is not treated on an equal footing with his wife.
According to Hover, the Queen has long been aware of the desire for a host of his husbands to understand and understand the decision.
A dream on the road: The car was on the motorway.
Tommil had an unmarried partner and two small children in cycle.
They did not insult the accident, but they will not receive insurance if one side is not pursued.
This accident occurred in the case of Kimolan.
A perceptible picture of the framework of III construction work.
On Tuesday, Vantarian Tombus tells his family how wonderful it was to be in a car accident.
Tomus, his unmarried partner Rio and the two small children of the parent were driving through the motorway for Kimolan.
The framework of the accession of the IIII to the Häniciness was used to accelerate the white car, which was a driving force for the cars of the family, Mr Tombu.
Without an outrageous movement, the car would have been more involved.
Mr Jarrush and I converted the car at the same time and it left its hands, Tombu tells us.
The car of the family fell at a heavy rate.
Parents and two small children in the back season were not injured.
One of the children is a little under the age of 30s, another under a year.
It was apparently quite a good joke when we did not have anything.
Nobody at the top did drive us down, even though there was a great deal of traffic in place.
The accident occurred at around 7.20 p.m.
According to Tokyo, nobody stopped to create them, and the family was a centre of emergency.
They got out of the car by their own means.
The staff of Mr Ambulansson and the rescue facility were present and the family's condition was reviewed.
The car went to the ground.
Tombus tells him and the unmarried couples of the small incomes and they received aid from the car a couple of years ago.
Without information from another car, the family will not get any money from insurance.
That is why the family wants discoveries from the brink of the car, which is why the family has gone to the street.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children into account and work without it, as Mr Tombu says.
Tomo saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably at the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 200s.
In his opinion, the beginning of the car register was a brand.
If the guilty is not caught, I do not know how we are going to stay financially, we will have to calculate every Senate today.
Tomo hopes that what has happened, or what you know, is connected with the police.
The police in Eastern Uudan and the Central Civil Protection Institution have been confirmed that they have had an accident on Tuesday evening.
The title has been corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally stated, the other car did not appear to be covered by Total, but instead it was a time to speed up the village of the family car.
The Loya Jäph proposal deals with human relations by humble means - the Itseiller will be seen in the Mexican theatre on Friday and Saturday.
Loya Jäppers from the Child brings his special guidance to Mectheatre.
The music revealer is a music theatre proposal for the past human relations and inadequacy.
Loya Jamar says that is still a good idea.
It is a matter of humility.
It is not a pleasant emotion, he says.
A rotating summer theatre proposal has been carried out in a piecemeal way, according to Jäph, with a large, young budget and with a great heart.
The title of the motion is a challenge to reflect on what man is revealing when he is familiar with the new person.
Perhaps he will play a role or will he be approaching another shop?
The unremarkable proposal confuses fax and philosophy.
Mr Järm has both steered and dramatically brought the proposal forward.
He is also responsible for the light.
The proposal is made up of the working party's texts and does not have a drink.
The director believes that, although the proposal goes back to the ideas of young people, it speaks of all ages.
Mr Järm underlines that the envoy of Itseventh is not directly reported on his own or on his relationship with the people of the working group.
Fax and philosophy are confused.
I am sure that my own world of values will be transmitted.
I do not think that human relations are bad, but nor do I think that human relations, especially relations, are a prerequisite for success.
Many of them learn from their distinguished parents.
The Jupppph believes that the Itseiller is characterised by the current picture of young adults living in a hundred years of age in Finland.
According to him, many people have learned a great deal from human relations with their parents, many of whom have distinguished.
At least that we should listen to ourselves.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The proposal looks like Minea Liven, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The working party also includes a joker Estonia Sellman.
Music reconciliation is Jäph and Rok.
Love to the theatre was born in Kovaka.
The Loya Jäpm, 26, is studying the theatre as the guiding point in the Tamil Cacademy of the Turkish professional college.
There are two years ahead of us and another motive.
The Jewish enthusiasm for theatre has begun over the years.
The music classes have grown as a assistant in Kouvan theatre and have seen, among other things, the Ylitigation theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, in Linnatheatre in Turu.
Guidance has begun to be of increasing interest.
Last week in Helsinki, the envy arrived on the Narri scene.
A lasting proposal of around 45 minutes has also been seen in the future, at least in the Jewish city of studying in Turkey.
At 4.8 p.m. and 5.14 and 19 p.m in Kouvan Memorandum.
For a year, the Finnish Olympic winner recalled a terrible accident of motivation crossings - the coast collapsed.
A few sportsmen and women in Finland have the same unstopped natural force as Jaya Lakhstan.
In the middle of the bill, the world was rooted in hundreds of days a year and divided its dream of the Olympic Games.
The dream was realised in 2002, but the Lah movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainer, but also an experiment for new species.
There are probably not many forms of sport on the ground that the lakes would not have tried for once at least.
It has inspired to do so.
There is always something new, Mr Lah says.
At the end of the day, one of the pressures was to stop Lakar altogether.
In 2014, Lakar suffered a motor crossroads accident.
As a result, his crossroads and both hands collapsed.
I was not working anywhere.
I lived at home for a year, Lakar.
Lakar had bad luck.
He also admits that the age could have a part to play.
Driving through the back can sound like a hurry.
But I did not apply for borders.
It is just as a species that it is so hard that you do not overload the mouthpiece!
After the accident, Lakar was faced with a special situation.
His urgent life stopped like a wall.
Behind it was a long chalk as the main chief chief of Japan's frestle.
Lakar began in the wash immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was fifteen years old, I had to be there.
I did not really do much, Mr Lakar says.
Even at the time of the lowering time, Lakar has often challenged his protection in the body and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and psychologically so tired that our own ideas did not seem sensible either.
Not even with species.
It was good to be here.
I actually enjoyed it, because for once I was really allowed to be.
The compulsory outbreak was raised as the main Finnish Head of State.
Without interruption, he fears that he would have returned to the end.
It is easier to find places that have gone out of Croat rather than club!
Without an accident, I would not have realised that I had to sleep so much.
Lakar began as a Finnish pharmaceutical driver about a year ago.
At the same time, he put a safer burden on the female creatures.
I changed mothers to frisegiegolf!
After all, it left the law immediately.
At its worst, I was seven hours thrown up every day.
Although Lakar has always been a superficiary tree, he does not insist that his enlightenment be the same as he did.
I am not imposing on everyone the same memory.
There is room for our own variety culture and ways of becoming the best in the world.
Mrs Freestone is free, and the mentality has always been in line with what Mr Lakar says.
The chromium will come and we must be concerned.
It is here: A report on technological developments in the sex sector - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 can no longer become strange.
Yes.
The chromium has now been beaten.
The Foundation for Respongiform encephalopathies, FRR, recently published a report on the development of sex robbers within the next 5- or ten years.
'We must start to take the increase in sex robbers seriously ', say that the foundator of the Foundation and Professor Noel Sharararky Sharararky, the academic professor of the University of Sheveloping.
Customers can choose the type of colour, shape and fingerprints of robust eyes.
'Sharay 's report was made public.
The Sekets have developed from the puzzle to robust robust, which have a widespread silicone and an intellectual characteristics which remind people of the use of human beings.
The user can also adapt the robust to his own preferences from colouring to shaping and colouring.
It is all the more worrying that the Roma have a 'personality' which makes the women of Stepford look like progressive freedom fighters.
The Sekets have developed into rabies with silicone human beings.
For example, the characteristics of Realtix can be adapted to the preferences of the user, for example, to the user.
The Roxy Company has been characterised by preliminary heritage: Frigigrich Farrah seems to be a mockery, Wild Wendy is adventured and so on.
'Roxy y Goldin's heritage is as adapted as possible to the heritage of the user as far as possible ', the company's websites are advertised.
In other words, Roma is keeping the same things as the user.
It also has different views:
It may, for example, be tired, in the wind or in the wind.
There are many disturbing features of the increase in the increase in the number of atrocities, replacing genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the subordination of women and direct rape fanaticism when the user approaches, for example, software robust and counter-software.
True Companio compares his website with the Roxxy robottle to vibrator:
'Women have a vibrator; why should men not have sex robust? '
However, chromium is not just a fresh or a new form of sex.
Their increase and development illustrates something that is worse and deeper in our culture: The recession towards gender equality, where exposure is one option among others.
The majority of men do not, of course, acquire sex robust and continue to favour them from a margin, even though the FRF report has reported that they are growing in favour.
Marginal phenomena, however, show much the spirit of time.
And many people will only start behaving bizarre or insulting once the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sexes have become more common, while women's rights are threatened throughout the world and the Belarus has a president who has praised women in their harassment.
In Television, The Handmaid 's Tale' is not the most worrying language, for example the picture of fed bodies and overstretched eyes.
The Republic of Gild is far from reality, but it seems surprisingly short journey at the moment.
Attempts are being made to make chromium as many real women as is technically possible.
The authors of the Robles want their people to feel genuine and movements to trace as much as possible human movements.
However, their 'cancellation' is far from reality.
It is not possible to leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history - there is no sign of independence or of total resignation.
They are pleasant service providers.
Mr Ortuondo.
The police doubts: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group led Mr Isin.
The extremist organisation, Isin, led a group of Australian men suspected of exporting a bomb to the Ethhad Airways plane.
According to Sydney Morevy, Sydney had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
There was suspicion that the bomb was to be exported to aircraft on 15 July, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police do not say more precisely why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a equipment that separates toxic gas and to take the equipment to a full public place, for example in public transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings will continue.
The good aspects of Trush?
Let Mitt Romney look like common sense.
During the Trushi period, it has already been repeated from time to time that the strong division of the electorate has also dissolved families at arbitrary level.
On the path of Christmas and Day of Protection, the American newspapers learned how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trushi.
We are all called upon to clean our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to the ability of Mr Trukumpi to unite families.
I say this because my Serbs went to me this week in New York and he is a left-wing poet in Chicago, who has for a long time been married against our relatives with the Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a strong combined effect.
Now that Trump is in Belarus, my Serbs are all familiar with - including republicans - with which he has been arguing about politics for decades are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
In the middle of the table, it is a good thing, but, in the broader sense, there are significant risks.
Mr Trump has given the Left a new impetus, but the distorting effect of his presidency can in fact take us all right.
When we talk about Trumpi and 'normalisation', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be horrified by his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more appalling chance that the Republicans of the Trump normalise the right extremism, which suddenly appear to be quite reasonable compared with Trumpei.
I would like to remind you of the tempted version of Mit Romney on madness: The downstream of a car, the 14% income tax (and his tax notification we have seen at least), which seems to be very slow in comparison with Mr Roennea.
Once the Trushi era is over, the next presidential candidate for the Republicans only needs to be clear, and that seems to be a considerable improvement immediately.
When my Serbs were visiting me, we dreamt our children of the Middle Ages, which is the biggest caricature and the best that New York receives in New York with three dollars without dogs.
The horses in the carrot are enormous, the middle-east - bogus cluster and horror-looking animals - are harmful and the underlying music is strange.
Many of the symptoms of New York will, in time, be disappointed: The prospects for high buildings are starting to be flouted, the city's brink is too familiar and the reality of the city is not in line with the dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, Mr Swiss Cotage has not gone completely beyond the fact that Swiss Cotage is not a Swiss mess, but a major transport circuit in Northern London, although Ye Londe Swiss College is a Switzerland pub, but it is not calculated.
On the other hand, it is still strange - even to the extent that two years of age, one and two four-quarters of women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carrot full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately nobody had asked.
On the other hand, I was asked this week in a freight house to evaluate my 'experience of payments' in one of the five lines before I put my credit card on a number of articles.
The same thing happened in coffee corridors, but I am also given the opportunity to combine an evaluation of the 15% service money when I go to search for a coffee.
This will slow down the everyday interaction and will put pressure on customers to put their own house in a situation in which it is not necessary.
The freight house sales smiled to regret the fact that I had tirelessly given my credit card five sets of experience.
Shevikh Kuysci was given a boost from Interreg - 'I was not a leader's confidence'.
The FC Inter has today released the Sheft Kukhope club team of Representatives from the task of the selector.
The responsibility for reducing reductions to include Fabrizio Piccaretta, who was the assistant in the past.
The rest of the team of enlightenment will continue with its current tasks.
In the past, the Italian Piccaretta has been a assistant in the English, for example, Sunderland.
In January, the 51th anniversary of the Interpol Group, Piccaretta, has carried out the UEFA Pro licence last year.
The President of the Government of FC Interreg, Stefan Höss, is sorry to see what has happened.
It is never an easy or pleasant task to change Valencia.
However, Mr Kukhope no longer had any confidence in the management of the club, in which case there was no alternative now, Mr Haids commented on the report on the follow-up.
The Piccaretta Agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He, together with the other team of enlightenment, is already responsible for tomorrow's domestic match with the HIFK.
According to Iltalitarian Santini, the team has overturned Thursday.
On Thursday morning, he told the players that the club managers Piccaretta and John Alli have been removed.
Last Saturday, in an INTERREG match, the PS was strongly received by Mr Kuchi and Mr Piccartel.
Linda Lindh published a young image of the 80s - would you recognise a serious window student?
Linda Linda Lamphem published a youth image in Instagrage.
The picture has been added to the picture a number of alarm scares which would make it possible to conclude that the music describes a 16th-year-old student in Siblius Akatea.
Mr Lampheus himself is wondering about a young woman looking at a serious camera.
Long ago, he is sending out a serious message.
If you do not see the picture, you can see it.
In the past, Lampheus has published pictures of its past and has also talked about painful subjects.
Just a year ago, he published a few descriptions of his own in Instagrage.
The second description is to see him 20 years ago, the other way he is now leaving, as mother of two children.
In his pragmatic text, Lampheus considers his own growth as a human being and refers to the cancer disturbances that he suffered as young people.
Just 20 years ago and today...
I still seem to be very much like that 260s girl, but the difference is that I have learned to keep myself and what I see, Mr Lampus wrote.
He had added life to the text in English, eating disorders, insecurity, self-confidence, self-confidence, love for himself, 1996, 2016, older people, girls, women, ageing.
Lampheus has spoken openly about its eating of previous years.
He was already 14 years old in hospital because of his anthrax and his orphans.
A little later, he also suffered from his bull, which eventually only came to light in 2006.
The improvement began with a little bit of a moment.
In addition to theory and comparative aid, Lampham has helped a new love.
Oscar Piscus was sent from prison to hospital because of breast blocks.
This is the second time that Mr Pistos was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for the messages in his anchovy, which, according to the prison authorities, he had disappeared in the Czech Republic.
He was sentenced to murder from the original death sentence of the accused.
He murdered in early hours on the Day of Sthens by shooting a number of blocks through the WCs at home in Pretoria in 2013.
Mr Pistos claimed that he was a daughter of his daughter in the WC at night.
The public prosecutors have told us that they intend to re-complain because they consider the judgment of the six years of the Piscard to be too far.
The Quartet intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of Eastern Africa, and the complaint will perhaps be dealt with as early as this year.
If the complaint is adopted, the judgment of the Piscard can be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in Eastern Africa.
Two Bosnians were arrested for illegal dissemination in Greece.
Two Bosnians who have been illegally released were arrested in Greece, notified by the foreign minister of the country according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a number of people disseminated in Sithonia on 1 August morning, including two Basque people.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the television channel, the Department of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced that it released the Basque people.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the free rules for camps and have already made substantial fines available to all those who are spreading in other areas other than the destination.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The minister stated that the right to fines may be imposed.
The Nestone part of the Nestone is sinking - it has already fallen by between EUR 7.7%.
The oil processor, Nestone, has fallen by about 7.7% at around 11 p.m.
The result was reduced before taxes, but it exceeded the prediction of Inquiry Financially.
The trade in swine fever has begun on the packaging side of today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
A little since the opening up of the markets, the large European Stoxx 600 index had been weighed by 0.2%.
The overall index of the Helsinki stock exchange, OMXH, had fallen by about half an hour since trade, by 0.3% to 90.48 points and by 0.3% by the most replaced companies OMXH25.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, nine million of which were the interpreter of this morning.
Livestock, milk products and chocolate may alleviate the symptoms of an ageing chocolate.
The watchful meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmare of the food chocolate system.
Research, however, claims the opposite is true: Food diet containing a great deal of meat protein and milk products may facilitate the symptoms of obsolete beef.
The symptoms of an ageing Holocaust are an incurable disease which affects around 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 in Britain, causing crude, frustration, repeated or bloodshed, weight and extreme floods.
Those who suffer from the ancient Holocaust are generally called upon to avoid meat and milk products, but the Washington university researchers found that the indispensable amina in the protein will help the organ to develop immune cells which will strengthen the silicone's ability.
According to the leader of the investigation, Marco Colonn, immune cells watch the sky and ensure that harmful microbes do not get into the body.
Cells that cause infection are balanced on cells that strengthen silicone performance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the birth, the symptoms of the anguish may be.
Experiments have shown that immune cells that strengthen swine fever are in carbon with a certain quantity of bacteria.
This bacteria needs irritates in order to open up immune cells, which is one of the buildings of proteins.
"We discovered the link between Lactobobobobobobobobobobaccus royalty and the evolution of cells promoting silicon, which is part of normal microbic biomass, Professor Colna says.
"The more of the carbon diet there were potatoes, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same applies to people, the combination of Lactobobobobobobobobaccus roams and a large catering village containing plastic can strengthen the potatoes of the marriage of the marriage and reduce the volatility of the future.
When examining immune cells to strengthen swine fever, Dr Luisa Cervantein Barraga discovered that, although one group had such cells, they were not found in the carbon species separated from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiological biologists in the microbiologists of the highways, that is to say the Food Schocolate channel, to the community of bacteria, in other words to the Community of Food and Mission.
When the DNA was investigated, six bacteria were detected in the microchip with immune cells but not in the rest.
When Lactobobobobobitus reactors were given to microchip in the stereotyping environment, which did not have microbic bacteria and which did not develop immune cells, they began with immune cells.
Researchers wanted to clarify the impact of the immune system on the immune system; they grown up in Lactobobobobobobobobacco clothes in the bud and transferred small quantities of nitrogen - without the bacteria - to discarded impotent immune cells.
Music conditions developed into cells to strengthen piracy.
When an active ingredient was cleaned up, it proved to be a by-product known as an Indian-3.milk milk.
When researchers doubled the quantity of carbon dioxide in food, the number of cells that strengthen silicone capacity increased by around 50%, and when the quantity of cells was halved, the number of cells fell by 50%.
According to Mr Cervantevsky-Barragan, human beings have the same cells to strengthen silicone levels as coal, and most of us have Lactobobobobobobobobobacco corridors in our food chocolate.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of Lactobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobaccus from various bacterium can develop in human beings in the same way as carbon, but those suffering from the ancient Holocaust have been found to be gene errophysical errors.
'We certainly want to promote the development of these cells, because they regulate the future of the inside-the-spot, Cervory Barraga.
"High levels of cyclical fanaticism, combined with Lactobobobobscills, may contribute to their widespread use".
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester Union had a 'nice' agreement with Nemann and Matichone.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester Union had a 'narrow' agreement with Nenmann and Matichi, a central player in the jargon of Manchester Union against Samphud on Wednesday evening.
On Tuesday, the 40 million pounds transferred to Celesseas, Matic began 21 victories in Dublin, the last Union match before the UEFA Cup match against Real Madrid, which made an impact on a defending Middle Ages against a target such as Paul Pot and Andreas Pereira.
Mr Matic was not yet in the best condition, however, because he was not involved in an Asian blue prior to the beginning of the period, and he went for only 45 minutes - that is, according to Mr Mourinho, a change will have to come before the beginning of the magistrate.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and philosophy make him anonymous - he has a great football philosophy", Mr Mourinho says.
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later '.
Not only Mr Maticho, but also the newcomers, Victor Lindelopf and Ronoise Lukashenko, were starting to play at Aviv stadium when Mr Mourhinho began to visit the start of the period.
This week, Independent revealed that Mr Mourinhinho would like three more players, even though the follow-up has already done 'excellent work' by acquiring three of the four players that he prioritised.
"Three out of four - for which we should thank the follow-up" - he added.
'I am more happy if I receive all four, but they did excellent work '.
For two separate periods, Germany was persecuted by world women.
The Finnish flight daytime screen disappeared from the fourth match of Mexico to Germany directly to 03 (2325, 2325, 1425, 1425).
There is a high level of German routine for saving.
They were playing on an equal footing in every sector, Tapio Kangatsniei, the Finnish chief Director-General, said in a notice.
In the first two of them, Finland kept its opponents hard, but in one third Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the way.
When we were saved patiently and with enough aggression in certain places, Mr Kangatsnieemi said so.
The most effective Finland had collected Piia Korhonn from 14 points.
Three complaints have disappeared from four points in Finland on Sunday.
Reuterckx: A large power of power has already sent out challenges in connection with the Trump Jrust meeting with Russia.
In the United States, the great ruler has sent the challenges of Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyers in connection with the meeting of Natalia Veelsky.
The great secretariat invited by the European Prosecutor Robert Musur has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of the Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veysnic.
The news office, Mr Reuterckx, is telling us that, at the same time, Wall Street Journal, revealed earlier on Thursday the convening of a large number of white crew.
According to Mr Reuterski, a large power of power has sent out the challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr and the famous Veystile with the United States presidential elections in June 2016.
Donald Trump Srike was also present at the then campaigner leader of Donald Trump Srikfort and his colour, the current adviser of the Belarus, Javid Kushner.
According to Mr Reuterster 's sources, the fact that the special prosecutor, Robert Muller, has invited a great supervisor in Washington, is a step closer to the pace of investigation in Russia.
The source adds that Mr Muller wanted a large power of power to assist a investigation into Russia's involvement in the American presidential elections and whether the campaign in Trushi or his vicinity cooperated with Russia in this matter.
A large power extends the rights of Mr Musur to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to prove literally.
A large group of ordinary citizens work behind closed doors.
A large superstate is weighing up the evidence that the prosecutor has examined and deciding whether or not to prosecute.
The British microchip itself in order to get their homes and cars together.
The British inventor has been the first to microchive himself throughout the country so that he can open his home door, get his house in office and start his cars with the hand.
The microchip is between a 3rd-year-old Steven Northama's shelter and front, now offering services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of the Northama Beysah.
Northam cooperates with Geopf Watson, a Royal Hampshire hospital in Winchescheschesche in Hantster, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip.
Microchip uses the same technology as cats and dogs in microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The attempt by Northama to convert the number of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip will cost 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child and has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 cars, which begins when he draws his hands on the steering cycle.
Thousands of dollars were paid to the taxpayer by showing the white house.
The decision of the white house last month to fly the helicopter of the marine forces to the southern hemisphere of the Belarus was to cost the taxpayer USD 24 000, as is evident from the documents of the TIME army.
The name Marine One, the President of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, is used for a white Sixsky VHHHHD-3D helicopter, which was a milestone at the events of the American construction programmes in Belarus between 17 and 7.17 p.m.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of officials from the Belarus were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Cotte, there were sailors from Mainin, the fire car from Wisisisisconi and the town Missir.
The White House 's military service had requested only about 36 hours before it landed to the south' exceptional ', as is evident from the documents of the HMX-11 helicopter ship.
'I just wanted to ensure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event which will give much visibility ', the Deputy Commander of HMX-11 wrote in the e-mail to his leader, who is the Deputy Commander of the Appeal of Maritime Safety.
The message was that helicopter would arrive in the south between 17 and 7 a.m. and that it would start from three this afternoon, and that the Hellkophop would only leave after the nineteenth heckler would be empty in the evening between six and nine.
The message also stated that, if the source of helicopter from the Belarus had been delayed, another crew would have to be required because of restrictions on service time.
The original crew was in helicopter during the event and the staff of the unit were helicopter when it was there.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The American Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state ownership for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMXI-1 asked whether the incident was in breach of the law.
'one of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was being violated here, and we were told that it was not a violation ', the commander wrote.
'It sounds as if you can take part ', the Deputy Commander replied.
The United States of America was an official event in the Belarus, so it was not covered by Hatch Act.
But official events also have political treasures.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of the health reform that was discussed at the Senate and of less state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys;
But using them for photographs is unusual.
The actions of Mr Trumpei were revealed in February by Air Force One in the background to the presidential campaign campaign in Melbourne Florida, a country in which Mr Trumump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's official plane in Twietter.
"The white house is very pleased with the event in America of products from all 50 federal states produced by American workers", Lindsay Walter, Secretary of the press in the Belarus.
The crews of the HMX-1th unit regularly carry out training flights in Washington territory and carry out in the south of the south, with the accuracy of the centres of the Belarus convicted by the President.
When, at the God Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMXI-1 made 58 training landfill for the white house.
According to an official, flights to the event in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The helicopters of the unit were also flying eleven hours in the 'Ethiopian President'.
According to the White House, this incident did not cost the taxpayer any other expense.
Mr Sixsky 's spokesman said that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter' s presentation in the south of the Belarus.
HMX-11 do not have accounts on the flights relating to the presidential duties, and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event carefully.
According to the Defence Ministry's compensation of 2017, the level of compensation for VHH380 per hour is 24 380 dollars per hour.
According to the documents of the HMX-11 unit, flights from Quantho to the white house of Virginia were held in total by an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using helicopter is considerably lower.
"A reduction in the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading", as Mr Walter says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staffing, maintenance and many others, the so-called decommissioned costs that are taken into account in the annual budget."
According to a study by the RAND research company in 2015, the levels of compensation do not contain personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.
At the time of the event, the former Secretary of the press, Sean Spichter, was arguing for the use of helicopter in the event.
'The idea is to present American production ', as Mr Spicer said.
'I know that Mr Sixsky and the Länder of Cotte are very proud that they are involved in securing national security and will therefore employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I believe that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopter and other defence equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to point it out '.
It is not certain whether or not a fire driver visited Trump helicopter, but at least he spared a fire driver.
In the white house, Mr Trump went to the press for his own Sixsky ship.
'I know Mr Sixsky very well ', the President said' I have three of them '.
The secret identified Vaastro - trains have to be replaced by bus.
Passenger trains between Seapore and Vaya are an exception for technical reasons, announcing the Rault Centre.

The Secretary of State of Venezuela calls for the right to prevent a new delegation from being appointed.
The Public Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court ruling to prevent a new delegation from being appointed.
The President of Venezuela, Nicola Maduro, has stated that the elected representative of the Venezuela was to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a delegation was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Mr Luisa Ortega, the Public Prosecutor has been asked for a non-electoral decision.
Mr Ortega has also started a vote on an electoral fraud inquiry.
He appointed two judges after a British company holding a parliamentary vote reported that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuela authorities was approximately one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only the allies of Madame were conditional on Edysjidau, and the elected 5550s include, among other things, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the delegation can dismantle the congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro has been described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers that the constitution should be amended as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have stated that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is a solution to the political and economic crisis in that country.
The anxieties in Venezuela have been continuing for months.
Many people have been injured and more than one hundred have died.
Venezuela collapsed in the economic crisis following the fall in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is expected to prove itself on Friday when the new delegation is due to start.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States.
On Thursday, in the United States of America, Mumim Senah, who is 411 years old, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for the involvement of the global computer body.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to Fontano, Senah was on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, tells the AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March of this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah had 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the US Ministry of Justice, Senah will be expelled after a prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Finland after the arrest and said that man should not be handed over to the United States.
In its opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for the fact that the arrest took place in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the name 'Erasmus', which infected tens of thousands of computers throughout the world.
The virus was used to fish users' names and secrets.
Since then, pedestrians used the data by still controlling Internet transport, which made crossroads and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blancon, the head of the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs, the case shows that the United States is also capable of squandering other Cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them before the courts, as Mr Blanco said in his report.

Kolan does Paris by name Day and Night.
The themes of this action are a lie and darkness - day and night - a sun and a taste.
The deeds enlightened the headquarters of UNESCO, Fonteno, and the Globe monetarist on which it is represented.

A letter from Timo Soinin in a questionnaire entitled 'then there was a water aquaculture'.
On Thursday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Timo Sov, published a bloglogical letter, which has been named in a questionnaire.
The wording is short, only two words.
In my time, the party became thirty-seven members' government party.
Then there was the aquaculture, now all the night, Mr Soini, wrote.
The Soini text contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XVV or this love of love, we are known to have used a water comparison.
Depending on interpretation, the words' after us' or 'water aquaculture' have remained in history.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
The elections will only be representative if they can vote for all the members of society, including women, on Wednesday, on the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
The ad hoc leader of the UN delegation, Nicholas Hayshoom, said that there are hundreds of women in the elections of the provisional councils, three women seek Vice-President and more than 30% of the recently registered electorate are women.
'Women's role cannot be emphasised too much ', as Mr Hayssen said in his statement on Wednesday.

Haysom said that the contribution of women to strengthening democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent Afghan electoral commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
Friday is sad and wind.
Friday will bring a great deal of rain to the south.
In the urban areas, the tone is harsh and fairly wind.
This afternoon, the clouds will shape and can develop chickens.
The evening is clearer and absent.
A coalition imports a great deal of rain from the south and medium-sized part of the country, and in the south there is also a link.
In the south of the evening, there is lunch wind and clearer where rainfall can become.
The temperature is approximately fifteen per day, more uniform off the south-west coast, near two hundred per cent.
In the north, the reason varies from one cloud to another.
During Friday and Saturday, low pressure is dominated by weather pressure in the south and medium-sized part of the country, and the rain is common.
In the north, the rain is minimal.
On Saturday, hundreds of places in the south and medium-sized part of the country are also present.
Sam also extends to part of the Kaishstan.
In the north, there is plenty of clouds this afternoon and individual rain rains.
The south coast is winded from lunch, in the middle and north of the country air traffic is in the east.
There is a strong low pressure on the north of the British islands, with a combination of rains in the south of Fennosososcus.
There is a Western flow in Western Europe and there will be some deaf rains.
In southern Europe, the weather is solar and hot and the temperature is in some cases above 40%.
In the eastern part of the Mediterranean, there are rhetoric.
The flooding of a certain number of tourists threatens the culture of the region.
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rape focuses in particular on the form of tourism represented by high-risk ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it 'e-and-fley tourism': Just a few hours are being targeted and the galleries are being weighed through in large groups.
Venezuela is going to be exposed to tourists in the city quickly.
It is difficult to move around on the streets and the fine embryos are so full of visitors that the people of Venice will no longer be able to join.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre while hotels have been replaced.
The problems posed by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon a bad tourist - a loyal Tourism.
When a large high-risk ship arrives, time will be given to two or three hours.
The doctrine of the Pizale, Piazale Romale, the bridge of Rialton and the Markus, and the conversion, the Italian Minister for Culture, Dario Franceschini, is describing tourism which causes problems.
The Italian cities' beauty is not only in the architecture but also in the operation of places, shops and employers.
We must maintain this part of urban identity.
The Speaker of the Holy Markorn is also one of the most popular tourists of the historic centre in Venice.
The Church of the St Markus is located on the window.
Local indignation is also mainly directed at risk ships.
50 000 local people are still living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were around 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, 2 000 vets demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants out.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time, there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, to say that the Carlo Belfrhar, who has organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships produce the income that they urgently need and create needs for a number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of crossroads, it is envisaged that the risk maps would go further from the historic centre.
According to Luciano Bortone, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Venetta Administrative Region, in which Venice is also located, were to have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Approximately 2030 million tourists are visiting Venice every year.
Are you in Kuopoulou?
Bad kilometres of congestion on the motorway
On Thursday afternoon, the motorway between Kuopoulou and Siilage has had congestion on Thursday afternoon in the north.
The region is working on motorway pricing, which is causing delays in traffic, tells us what Mr Sakharov said.
As far as knowledge is concerned, the speed limit of 50 km per hour instead of the usual 120 km.
In a 50 km limit area, however, transport had progressed at some point this Thursday afternoon at a phasing-in rate.
Road work is testing on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Constance in the case of the Ilistens station, that is to say the gold rock.
I will do well without such a attention.
The 23th-year-old drink has been seen to be public.
Amalie Iuel has published magnificent images of himself in the countries of Grand Canyon, among others.
The Danish Norwegian Amine Iuel has become a popular sportsman in his current country, Norway, not least because in March he violated the record of the 400 metres of Norway by circumventing the barrier of 51.81.
A month later, he improved the atmosphere of 400 metres in Norway at 5.38 p.m.
Iuel Iuel, who is working hard on the social media, soon discovered after his record, has its shadow.
Men throughout the world began to send their gender images to Iuel in the hope that young drinking maternity will be interested in them.
It was forced to exclude Snaphakesh accounts.
I received a lot of 'photographs' from unknown people, so I was forced to turn my accounts into private, Mr Iuel told the VGGs.
Iuel did not want to specify exactly what images he received in an interview with the VGs.
I am sure you can imagine, Mr Iuel 's.
It is painful to receive feedback after drinking, but I will do well without such a different kind of attention.
He was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, a father in Denmark.
The family changed Norway when the Ammians were 22 years old.
In the case of the 12th-year-old family, the father 's work changed first to Namibia and then to Pakistan.
Then they were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
He spent four years as a university sportsman (University of Southern California) in Los Angela, who returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norway.
In Norway, there are three selectors in Norway: Left Olav Alnev, Canary Warhol and Elisabeth Sledm.
Norway is much more open to discuss than the United States.
In the United States, the complainants are not doing anything, they are simply laying down rules.
In Norway, the selector has much more time to deal personally with the sportsman, Mr Iuel said to the VGs.
Amalie Iuel is holding the Iuel record of Norway in 400 metres and 400 metres in the atmosphere.
A fertiliser, Jan Korrima, went to the clothes of the whole career - now included in the Miss: "Nice when you get nowhere."
It has now been a pleasure to calculate when nothing has happened!
During this period, the most successful club players in Finland, Jaya Korrer, 31, have actually been able to enjoy their drastic species.
Until last summer, the continuation of the career was at stake.
The burdens on the table had been forced on the table in January and the noble did not want to improve at all.
They too had taken the lead in a crackdown.
In the summer, I knew nothing I did about whether or not to go ahead.
The Spouldonidians were blocked and many things were open, Mrs Korra says.
But it is said that things are usually organised.
A noble paradox, sponsorship continued for two years, and blood began to be put on the ball again.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that at the latest when I went on the club.
I was hoping that a few more will be watered down, yes that is so fantastic.
It was only in October that the Korrr was able to calculate properly, but, after a long calculation, only a painful recession has been a father.
Only a few walls have been circulated by the Korrr.
That does not harm.
The competition has never been the most important weapon in the gallery.
I have never counted for one wall.
He thinks it is frustrating to go to the cats for four years, and then you will hear it for a week.
I do not think so, Mrs Korer says.
Today, Korrhar is raging in the cheapest penny of the MMGPs in Sierra Neddddddu in Spain.
Even if individual cats do not like him on the plate, he is always born with a hard watch.
According to Korakas, the value of the Games organised by the International Coal Alliance has increased over the past few years, even though some of the players chose to hold Norway XX-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important cats, the visibility is a big one.
However, in other words, the value always depends on the conditions and levels of the cats.
Korakas is the oldest sportsman in Sierra Neddddu, the elderly sportsmen and women in Finland.
The team's deaths, the 170s of Rente and the Emmi Parknership are 14 years younger.
It is unacceptable to monitor the expenditure of the younger stretches.
I remember that, at the time, everything was new and was so enthusiastic about everything.
It will bring a new post for itself, Mrs Komer will think.
I shall stay in Rino to some extent, but otherwise I do not have a flow!
Jan Korrhar has also built another sporting career.
Mr Pekka Koröder has become a man in the field of raw materials: The player has his own food horses for which he is submitting treaties.
As I am in the realm all the time, it does not make it possible for me to be black.
But every day I see at least the results of the raw materials and, in general, something of origin, Mrs Korra tells us.
According to Korra, guidance and nutrition are a potential career plan when the spring career comes to an end.
I do not want to go so far, but that is at least a realistic alternative.
I do not see that as a bit as if I were studying it alongside the scaffolding.
I will try to keep up with time and develop, perhaps in the summer too.
If it is a future profession, then it will not be difficult to start when the species are ready.
The drink carrier Jakoo Linnon also includes Elitrates.
The crash has dropped the risk cargo, which will focus on the Elitrates competition at the end of May in Stockholm.
Mr Korrar and Mr Liningo decided to revive the old heritage.
The risk has gone very commercially and people have been enthusiastic.
We are already at the point that there will at least not be bankruptcy.
A few months have yet to come, let us hope that the ship will be full, Mrs Korra will say in her enthusiasm.
Everyone has been surprised by the Atndon Department project Kie.
Atndo Esteri is the title of a new, 41st-place hotels for the elderly.
The building of a high level of 1 700 kerosene forest will be ready next summer for the other side of the Health Centre's neighbouring Terveyards.
The general miracle issue is where the new care unit is sufficient for customers, because many private care homes are now leaving the customer shortage.
Mrs Anne Flink, regional leader of the Holland Services, has commented on the fact that, in future, there will be more demand not only for alternatives but also for an enhanced living of services.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, Mrs Flink says that freedom of choice works better.
Last year, private care homes in Kanervo and Eervon were taken from Kanervo.
Trade was about business, but buildings are known to be a five-year-old agreement.
Mrs Flink says that she does not have an acute need to remove activities from these farms.
Further today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVie'Scottish factory.
The trade union will apply for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory from the Directors of the McVie.
According to the British DG GBP, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Toxin factory.
The factory producing Hobnobin and Rick Tea has over 500 employees.
The McVie-British company reported that it had invested over five million euros in its factory over the past few years.
The company added that employees and trade unions will be told 'will certainly be the first' if changes are taking place.
In his letter to the Director-General, GMB calls on the company 'to respond to the concern that no funding has been earmarked for modernising production lines'.
The fact that the Director-General of the GMBP trade unions, Dw Duffy, is not informed of the needs of Toxin's business and future investment plans, is extremely worrying.
'families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been heavily focused on the local community and the city area of Glasgow, which is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor incomes.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods and the constant reduction in the cost of living and production in the east of Glasgow, we urgently need successful McVie production. "
According to Mr Pladin's expert, the operator had only received a letter from the trades union on the previous day and the company responds directly because it appreciates the ongoing interaction with workers and trade unions.
'We had a regular meeting with workers and representatives of GMOs in Tollrosssos two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with the workers the fact that, like other companies in a highly competitive and precarious market, we are constantly assessing all our business activities and all our offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the scientist, over 5 million euros have been invested in the Tollows factory in recent years, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operation.
'We are aware of the long history of Mr Tollscross as a production plant and will certainly be the first to inform workers and trade unionists if we are to make changes to their factory '.
Was it three years ago that PSG was going to be moved by PSG.
Laga may disappear from Marco's interest.
Paris Saxon-Germans will not be abandoning Neymar after paying for the end of the agreement of 189 million pounds, but will he warn PSG Barcelona of a virtual transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most familiar case in the summer; the Lord 1 team in France is prepared to break the world record on transfers; the previous record was less than half that: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester Union with a transfer of EUR 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's costly footballer and also the world's best paid professional athletes, because PSG offers him more than 500 000 pounds a week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be brutal with regard to the PSGs and the way in which Mr Neymar has left with force, a source close to Barcelona tells us that the follow-up has been very good for Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSGs consider this transition to football three years ago?
When Manchester City declared that he was interested in Brian Malaysia in 2014, Nasser All-Khelifi warned the best players in PSGs.
'I am not concerned because they know that if they wish to see our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players', Mr Khelifi.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they look to our players, they will have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: It expressed its interest in Marco, the central player of the PSGs, in Marco, was compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italians to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcel will therefore lose its spring player in Neymar.

The white house recognises that two of the speeches made by the American President, Donald Trushi, have never happened, are reported in New York Times.
The telephone conversations by Mr Trumpi, both with the President of Mexico and with the leader of the Partido League, have proven to be invented.
Sah Huckabee Sanders, the spokesman for the white house, confirmed that there were no telephone calls.
However, he said that Mr Trump was not elected.
According to Mr Sanderson, many paradoxical leaders spoke to Mr Trumpi personally and Mr Pena Nieton, President of Mexico, Mr Trump had discussed Hamburg at the G20 meeting.
I would not say that it was a lie, it is a rather harsh accusation.
These discussions took place, not only in telephone telephone conversations, but in the case of vegetable plants, Mrs Sanders.
The speech to the paradoxical people was a source of contempt.
On Monday, Mr Trumump told him that the President of Mexico had praised him and praised Mr Trushi's success in eradicating illegal immigration.

On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a communication stating that this telephone had not happened.
On Tuesday, Polivia published a full version of the interview with The Wall Street Journal.

According to the information, the leader of the organisation, Michael Surban, has spoken for himself in his earlier statement, in which he had apologised to the paradoxists.
Mr Trushi's speech at the meeting of the Partido League gave rise to a great deal of astonishment, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
