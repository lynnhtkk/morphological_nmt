Mr Camuer wanted to correct his sex, diagnosed as meaningful and now he is doing the art of the subject - 'man should have the right to his or her own call'.
Dozens of pockets of potassium are flooded from the ceiling of Project room.
Every one of them reads the name of Camim Auer.
Papers show a multi-annual story of how outside people have written their interpretation of Aueria and its identity.
He decided who he is.
'I wanted to say something about my own therapy, so that the violence of the process becomes visible ', Auer says.
By means of this process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-old period of research, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with diagnosis studies carried out at Tampere and Helsinki.
Four years ago, the process started with Auer.
Even before that, he had used the aeroplane therapy that he had been holding through the Internet, and he had a very long way to go in his own repairment process.
He felt a woman, but under Finnish law a person must go through a process of correction so that he can also be legally corrected.
Transnational law, that is to say the law on the sexual consolidation of the Finnish family (563 / 2002), obliges transgenic people to fledgling, so that the right gender can be found, for example, in the demographic register and passport.
At present, psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability are required for everyone.
It is the right of people to decide on their own body.
'The situation is intolerable and violates human rights', says Auer.
The reform of the Transnational Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Council on Human Rights has made eight observations, and the ideal European Court of Justice is a precondition which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a legal amendment under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Mr Susette Hedvine.
Elections were held and the Peruvian people came to the government.
Now the change in law is again in the pipeline.
We are concerned here with internal political disputes which do not even relate to this law.
'The government does not want to put it on the table because there is disagreement within the government about changing the law '.
Two major institutions are dominated by this state of affairs.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions of medicinal products used by Mrs Auer.
For example, in the Statistics Institute, anyone can read the interpretation of Aueria in the university hospital in Tampere.
He met Camisi Auer twice and wrote a report on access to Auer.
The truth that is being investigated seems to be a threat to horror.
The perception of itself appears to be at a cross-border level to be highlighted by the unstable aspects of fragmentation and personality.
Mr Auer did not recognise himself.
'It was shocking to hear me diagnosed as', Auer says.
Even more shock was when Auerta was not given sexual repairment.
According to the staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
At that time, on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and saved a transnational TV.
Later on, this television was the emperor called Monud for the Excludd, where Auer reflew his experience of power and its use.
'It is madness that any person born as a woman can increase his or her vibrations, but that is what Mrs Auer says in order to remove vibrations. '
You are not your own if your homes were to be more than the gender defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of Mrs Auer is not the only one.
For many people, the process of redress is more severe for intellectual reasons than for purely medical operations.
There are dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to sexuality.
'It is madness that people who are in need of support and assistance should be denied treatment, on the grounds that their resources are not enough ', Auer says.
Many people involved in the process have symptomatic symptoms: Depression, anxiety, potential experiences of harassment.
In these circumstances, the staff can stipulate that the treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing access to treatment and aid can lead to an even worse situation than it was before the process began."
The self-exhibition by Mr Auer also deals with anxiety and ideas about suicide.
In the text of the debate, Mrs Auer writes: 'I have had some self-destructive ideas throughout my adults and that is something that people are generally finding difficult to merge'.
It has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it was easier.
He had at last been able to say the feelings that existed in children and teenagers.
Why did the bread not appear to fit in with its own call and why the guns had to be a wheel instead of an equitable circle?
The most important thing for Mr Auerta has been that there are people near him who see him.
We see a fundamental need.
"You have to justify yourself by talking so much, sweetening, using votes and movements," he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels that he is already being seen as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, a great deal of pernicious comments could be made.
The most striking thing is when people who are close to sex abuse.
"They should know and know who I am, but they do not agree or are not in a position to internalise", "he will continue.
Not all trusts, however, need physical changes.
They do not suffer from California, that is, from slavery, where the body or parts of it can cause distress and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, there can be no official confirmation of their own sex.
'There is no medical justification for these studies', Auer says.
And that is true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to legal gender.
The applicant is making a written application for a new identity card, saying that he feels he is another sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives a new identity card to the applicant.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition is also heeded.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for artists; it is a political and artistic compilation.
I want to believe that art is still important and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
To Camuer Auer, Antiphic Dick 4.8.8.2017 were exhibited by Mr Project Roomen.
Travel warnings were issued by the NGO in Missour
The National NAACPA has issued a travel warning about Missourir, the cause of which is the discriminatory practices of the federal state and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
'AACP's travel communication to Missourir will enter into force on 28 and 8.2017, calling on AfroAmerican tourists, visitors and local authorities to pay particular attention to and respect extreme caution when travelling in a federal state where a number of dubious racial events have taken place recently. '
The recent law in Misouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to justice, and the law of the Länder is being applied in a disproportionate way to minorities, and according to NAACP, these factors led to a travel warnings.
'The civil rights of people are being violated.
They are detained on the basis of a colour, ill-treatment or killed ', the President of the National AACP, Mr Rod Chapel, said to the United Nations.
'We have not heard in the past one of the many cases in just as short a time '.
Travel communications with Misska are the first warning from the organisation about the United States.
The organisation mentioned, for example, the racist comments made against AfroAmerican students at the University of Misouri and the death of Tory Sanders, who was a 28th year old from Tory.
Mrs Sanders died earlier this year and she was going to drive through the Länder when her car ended the fuel and Mr Missouri's police arrested him even though he was not accused of crime.
Reference was also made to the report by the Minister for Justice in Miss that the police will stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the White Paper.
'The purpose of the communication is to urge people to be careful and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Miss', Mr Chapel says.
"People will have to prepare, for example, by including funds to pay for guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the Länder."
According to the FBI, in 2015, hundreds of wine were recorded in Misouri, in other words sixteen most of the United States' Länder.
The travel warnings are also a response to the new Miss law, which makes it more difficult for companies to take recourse to justice in terms of living and working relations.
The ACLU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after adopting immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people from immigration commission, according to which this will increase race-based profilment.
Travel warnings are generally published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and apply to other countries, but recently they have been published by non-governmental organisations in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle Linkohr asked for an explanation from Mr Finn on the supplementary pension of the Director-General.
The State's owner Minister for Industry, Mr Mika Linree, has asked Mr Finn for an explanation on the supplementary pension premium received by Mr Pekka Vauramo, the director of the airline company.
According to the Minister, this runs counter to the state 's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 in Vauramo came to light this week when the Helsinki reports on rewarding the stock exchange managers.
Finnish Kuvali reported on Vauramon's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said that he would abolish supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has maintained that supplementary pensions are not used to reward.
The State owns more than half of the Finnaire.
According to the company, this decision is in line with the principle of ownership last year.
Sanctions made speeches straight away.
Only a while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from the village to the warmest.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, seemed to be doing well.
Since then, the tunnel has fallen considerably.
The response to the new economic sanctions which the US Congress adopted last week and which were signed by Trumpi on Wednesday was smooth.
The most Tyrynical response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medina, according to which the Trumpi Act is a 'full-scale embargo'.
Even if the Russians' reactions were to be described as political rhetoric and excesses, the escalation between the United States and Russia is a reality after a short month of nervousness following the election of Trumpi.
In the United States, it was not simple to pass the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Admittedly, Congress adopted the law with a considerable degree of consensus, but, as has been said, it was much more difficult for the President to adopt it.
Mr Trump criticises the law he has recently signed as' significant defects'.
President Trumpen's boom may have been due in particular to Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own prerogatives should have been counterproductive.
As is well known, the United States is examining the possible interference of Russia in the presidential elections as well as the Trumpi campaign in connection with Russia.
The escalation between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of knee-jerk.
As the staff of the White House have changed to the strictest and various scandalous developments have almost been updated, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted under the leadership of the President of the United States, but despite the President.
This situation is certainly not desirable.
If Russia is a trigger in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also an exciting security situation in the Union's nuclear region, the Baltic Sea is tightening up relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the Minsk Agreement to be implemented.
Although the Union has remained united in its policy towards Russia so far, at least on the top of the top, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a country like Finland, which is doing a lot of trade, economic sanctions have been a real hurdle.
The effects of the recent United States law on sanctions are still unclear.
The EU has been feared that sanctions will hinder many European companies.
In Finland, for example, the effects could be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennover nuclear power station project.
Happato in Europe has caused the exclusion of liquid gas, for example, which is important for the American economy.
Trade sanctions are a way of demonstrating disapproval in world politics.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well thought-out and monitored.
Otherwise, they will easily be more detrimental than good.
Is nothing more sacrosanct?
Trumpi's white house now has the Vpoligoutus statues.
Intervening in Patrai is a clear sign of change in power.
The Americans know as well as others: The Iraqi people, together with American soldiers, dropped Saddam Hussein's statutes in Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trumpi regime, knew well what was being done in a heated debate with Jim Acot.
Mr Miller did not actually criticise the statutes himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by a huge number of glass of cross-border organisers and the bosses of the Vpoliudenstastastaire.
His attack was targeted at the statutes and, in particular, at the fact that Emma Lazarus - 17 years after the statutory.
This is what Mr Miller termed Aosta: 'I do not want to go into history now, but the Freedom statutes is... the symbol of the freedom of the Americans who are enlightening the whole world.
Red was added later, and it is not part of the original Vogudenstaire. "
Mr Miller was not in itself wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
What is essential is the words of Lazarte, the only quality in which the State does not just call immigrants, but the poorest ':' Your lar, your pot, / your masses of yarning to the breaufree '.
Red is more topical than ever.
Mr Miller did not criticise literature; he made it clear that 'the poorest' are not welcome to the United States of Trumpi.
The controversy about the importance of its Vpoligostan is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarote friends campaigned for the hull to be put on its feet, who knew full well that it was a very political act.
The purpose of the statutes was to reflect the links between French and American republics with the classic symbols, the women 's body of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: He is no longer an abstract figure; he has a voice.
It gives itself a new name: The mother of the expelled.
The integration of Red Cross into the imagination was a fantastic feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nation.
Lazarus changed the importance of its statutes and the right has long wanted to turn it back.
Rush Limbaugh - a trend that can now be regarded as some sort of prognosis of Trumpia - argued in 2010 that the Vpoliuduarial statues did not invite anyone, but were an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives who takes the United States to cover up the dreadful darkness of the world: 'Liberty comes to light.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
War does not pave the way for the United States. "
Rarely, Limbaugh was right in part.
The role of the Pensioners' Party depends entirely from the point of view.
Lazarus saw this, as the poor and the poor and the poor, but hopeful, immigrants are on the ship after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for protection and a better life.
His statutes are shocking by giving hope and welcoming.
And that is absolutely not what Mr Miller and Mr Trump want.
Their warmongering does not show the way, but is flouting the flames of hatred, their only source of force.
General sport's Mutual rivalry 2017: Neil Black praises the British Mayor of Iceland Members
Eilidh Doyle will remember for a time when only two Scottish people were allowed to enter Iceland.
Mr Neil Black, the leader of the British General Sports Union, says that 16 Scots members of the World Cup are 'significant confirmation'.
On Friday, a number of Scottish sportsmen have been elected to the MMMM competition in London.
According to Mr Blak, 'in Scotland, something special' is happening and British general sport must learn from it.
'This is welcome and we will continue to study it so long that we understand what is at issue ', Black says.
'I spoke to the representatives of the Scottish sports institute and they thought it was related to the institution's activities.
The Scottish Confederation, on the other hand, believes that it is linked to the Union's activities;
And the British General sports federation believes that it is based on their actions.
And the ordinary cabinet believes that he must have something to do with this.
It is, however, something quite wonderful. "
Many sportsmen and women compete seriously in London with measuring accounts, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcht, who is competing with Sir Mo Farah at 5 000 metres, and Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the land team.
'Air is, of course, modest.
His speech was incredibly wonderful. "
'The sportsmen and women left the opportunity to be proud of their achievements and highly motivated wherever they happen to live and practise.
Eilidi said: 'There was a genuine feeling and passion about sport'.
Eilidh Doyle is a master of the Commonwealth in an axis of 400 metres, and these are his fifth of his world championship, and he believes it is' incredible 'that there are 16 Scottish nets in the taste.
The previous record was seven years 1983 and 2015.
In the course of the year, Laura Muir has sleaked five of the British and two European records.
He is competing in London with 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare running around 1 500 metres in London, and he should be watched: Man has an excellent period of profits in Iberian Mount and Anniversy games.
Mrs Doyle will remember her first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only player in the taste.
My captain says that he is' enormously proud 'that there are so many sweets, some of which are in serious competition with regard to the financial locations and measuring.
'Aapland access is a great honour, but even more so because the members of the Mayor voted ', Mrs Doyle says.
'I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who were allowed to join.
This shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished sportsmen and women who compete with the rewards.
What I am going to say?
In my view, that was all very well.
I concentrated on how lucky we are when we have households.
It is important that we enjoy domestic support and that we are back in the Olympic Games.
I will have another opportunity to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be a crazy joke. "
To prevent critics in Faceboards: Do not stand for public office if you do not hold criticism.
The father of our country knew what bad publicity is.
George Washington was loved by the Americans, but the newspapers were soon beginning to criticise him for any possible domestic policy in his political principles.
The criticism was certainly irritated;
But he did not silence his critics.
'Washington said 1783, if you remove freedom, you may end up in empty and quiet. '
That is what we shall get to the Governor of Marylanland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have deleted at least 450 comments and prevented their authors.
The US Civil Rights Association brought Hogan to court earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge to be unjustified, and their attitude was also minimal on the network.
'What difference ', after all, this is only Facebotage, a number of comments.
But it is important;
In the case of Hogan in particular.
Hogan is an amazingly popular republican governor under democratic control.
He has obtained the second best estimates of his actions among fifty governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive response to the hot.
He has led the Länder firmly and has kept to the principles.
He has also used Facebotage as his main channel of contact with his constituents and has published a picture of chemotherapy.
That is why preventing users from the Governor's Facebobotage is unnecessary and even dangerous.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chassen, defended his response to the post in his interview with Washington, which he said was nothing more than a question of modern comments.
It is, however, too easy to climb as trawlers, walls or anger.
Washington Post interviewed users prevented at Hogan Facebotage.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, not trawlers, but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and passports.
They told us that their comments were respectable, notable and relevant.
The passport quoted in his comment on the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic belief.
The lawyer, Lakshia Sarma Rai Maryland Bowieu, was not hostile but asked a question about wildlife.
'I will be polite enough to say that I am disappointed that Hogan had not adopted a position on fraud and other recent reports', he wrote in the news from Washington Post.
'I also find it unacceptable that when more people comment on the same subject they should be seen as something else organised and disregarded as a large group of people '.
The Governor staff called comments' a centralised attack '.
In the era of Facebotage, communication is easy to manage by preventing critics or by removing a critical comment.
In the past, the staff should have been sent to collect and incinerate newspapers with critical headings, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
However, it is the same thing, and now it is only digital.
Hogan is not the first public office to be accused of playing Facebool and other channels of social media.
Trumper users have appealed to him.
A first important decision was taken in Virginia last week.
According to Mr Cacheriöld, the government of the Louds Registrage was in breach of the American Constitution by blocking the first increase in Facebotage.
And the US Civil Rights Association had a conversation with the republican Governor, Mrs Matt Bevin, on the use of Twitter and Mr Faceboy.
That should not be difficult.
In Washington, cheap postal charges had the same effect as they have today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased four times from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers shouted Washington.
Even then, there were troika.
Mr Juricola, Mr Valerus, Mr Belissius and Mr Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they funeral the decisions of Washington.
The President's office received petitions criticising the Jayn Agreement, that is, the US-British Cooperation, a trade and sea agreement, as shown by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the cornerstones of our people.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer nutrition of birds must be stopped immediately.
Samples have become around ten places, and net notifications of a few, three.
Some of them have come from Earth and Warsaw Finland, but then individual Hapua and Seas, the specialist Marand ISomuru Eflow.
Video boys have died of a tricomonosis splendid.
It is caused by a scientifically called Trichomonas gallery in the early life.
It has been known in the past, especially in the dilemma.
In the twenty-first century, however, the disease was also detected by peacemakers.
In 2009, a very good approach was taken.
At that time, a tricolonum was caused by a major collapse in the Finnish wildlife position, and since then the species have recovered.
Sick wildlife has now been, but certainly not yet on the scale of the 'organic scientific centre' of the University of Helsinki, Juha Honfisa.
It is to be feared that the previous outbreak of wildlife will be renewed again if nothing is done.
What needs to be done is very simple and can be done by everyone: The immediate end to bird feed.
More will be done later.
Ronan Raffert hopes to benefit from home affairs in Renaissance Clubi.
The former European supreme player, Ronan Raffert, hopes to take advantage of home affairs for the next three days, when Renaissance Club is organised in Renaissance-Eastern Lothiana, 25.
Last year, the Archerfield Links, a Nordic Raffert, was led by a peak in neighbouring countries before the last round and finally lost Paul Eales.
'I followed the construction of Renaissance Club and, as a result of this event, it will come to full credit '.
'The players see their best on the ground: It is in a wonderful condition.
Jerry has done an excellent job with this place.
He is the most enthusiastic Ambassador and he is proud of his achievements here.
Peat is a wonderful opportunity for presentation on the ground. "
For the first time, English Eales defends the championship, even though, in its 32th-year career, it has won both the rotation of Europe and the European interview.
'There really seems to be a special opportunity ', a player living in Southpora says.
'I was unable to defend my victory in Extremadura Openi, because peat is not part of the circle this year.
It is wonderful to return.
This is a wonderful place to play golfia.
The memorandum of last year reminds me: The victory of security was wonderful for me and for my wife, Mr Sharon.
It was a wonderful time, which we will always remember. "
Gary Orr is returning to serious activities in his own country and he went to the rotation earlier this year after fifty years.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
'The game is always more important than usual ', the Order living in Helensburgh says.
'How you wish to succeed, but you are also familiar with extra pressure.
I have once again enjoyed cowardice and had quite a lot of fears.
I am pleased with my game so far. "
The three will be allowed to follow the example of the former Masterski winner, Ian Woosnanam and the Senator Majorn, Paul Broadurt, Roger Cacidman, Mark James and Mark McNulth.
Six Scottish dogs are involved: Orr and former Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldorn, Stephen McAally, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access, and stopping a car costs 5 pounds if there is only a driver and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in a car.
All products will be donated to the Prostate cancher UK.
In the village, the potential internal problems of the plant were cleared up.
In the village of Porin Brigade, there have been no internal problems, at least for the time being, with the polls being reported on Thursday.
Studies in the field of air transport will continue.
The reports started when a man who interrupted his service for health reasons thought that his health was weakened because of a lack of home affairs.
According to Mika Holman, the chief chief accountant of the Pori Brigade has not seen any problems in the health situation of other men.
It became clear that this was an isolated case and that other servants did not have health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any problem with the internal sky, as Mr Holmes says.
It says in the press that, due to the arrival in July, there has been a need to transfer goods to the army, which has allowed dust to increase for a moment.
The aircraft have therefore been able to appear emotional, as Mr Holmes says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia
Bardina Degno uses the food plant.
He rarely uses him.
Degno lives in the wood building in Enaroo, the capital of the Paniai region, which is in Indonesia's troubled Papua province.
In six hours' time, the bathwater that has been returned to livestock is eaten with fire, with no washing.
Mr Degei has no room in his home, and he is sitting on the other side of his target, in which he usually carries out his daily casualties, such as the bathing season from the beaches.
It is the mother in an unwieldy room that is going to be sent.
Degno is the youngest man from four wives and he has not been set to be treated.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: The majority of men in the village are unemployed and many drink, as well as soldiers.
"No one dares to go to the village after five in the evening", Degis says.
This is a rare Kurd in the Papua village, in the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, and was preceded by a controversial referendum forcing 1 026 villages to vote in public before the occupying forces.
The Jakarta government, which keeps the region under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from being able to enter.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua.
Enaroo is a peripheral and a cholera, and the journey from the capital of the province to Jayayaka from Jayaya to Nabie is continuing and will continue to be sinned at the village of a five-hour temporary car.
There is no public transport here.
Around 19 000 inhabitants there are wood houses surrounded by the Bambosoes, whose wayside is tired of the clock.
Few people in Indonesia have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian embassies get into the Papua Mema Pago tribes were able to return to Uga Tamee.
Other changes have been made.
'We did not have such clothes', Degno says, 'he means colour, starts dying at his peak price, a mouthpiece of woodland and a chronic cash.
"Before we only had the newspapers as a cover of our theirs."
It is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the corner of Indonesia.
Only about 100 km of Paniai is Gkberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold, owned by the Freeurt McMoran company in the United States.
In 2015, the rain brought to Freeede a value of USD 3.1 billion and a couple.
In addition, Papua has an estimated USD 78 billion.
For the Papuans, however, these wealth is a source of misery, which is the stifling presence of the strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost USD 20 million to local military personnel and to local army units between 1994 and 2004, and up to USD 150 000 were paid for for individual sinks.
This source of income is threatened by the demands for greater self-determination and is being ignored.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 priests and rape, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, collective superiority at the heights of the tribes of Papua in the 1970s gave rise to genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
The Brisban Archbishop report from 2016 contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture, rape and electrical attacks, which are particularly popular - and intransigent attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week", says Andreas Harbour, Human Rights Watch.
Food has been tightened up as Papua's natural resources attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as the wealthy islands of Indonesia, Jaata Jata, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi, convert Muslims into the region in the hope of a better living.
Bonemeal bonemeal is selling dried chickens and gadoos in the magic fodder.
It is difficult for local people to compete.
'For people have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaply than local ', Abet You, the 24th-year-old man who comes from Panian and changed to the capital of the province in the form of work.
"Local women lost their customers."
During his election campaign in 2014, the Indonesian President, Mr Widodo, promised to address the injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Aid consists of 29 regions, and this former puzzle won the vote in 27 regions, including the Paniai countries, on his visit to the President of Jakarta.
Little has changed in Papua, however, and local experience has been deceived.
'We grew up because we voted on Jokow in 2014 and expected him to fulfil our wishes and restore justice ', Mr You says.
Only two months after Jokows took office in October was Paniaya.
Eleven children were in receipt of Christmas shells in Enaroo, 7.12.14, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on the motorway.
Children who have been afraid told soldiers that they should use driving valves.
There was no comment from one soldier: According to the local passport, Yavedt Tebai, a man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the witnesses, children were caught and ill-treated by soldiers who were abused.
In that way, one soldier shot children.
One child, Yeimo Yeimo, was beaten by ill-treatment.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Board was put into fire and the next day began.
Around a thousand priests - young men and women and children - met in the football field to call for justice.
They had hunting forces for celebrations, and they started to present the Papua My Pagitao trip 's traditional Wild dam, which is dancing in and trailing the holiday box.
Some demonstrators started to tighten up the police and military structures.
When the tunnel hears, the soldiers in the internal radio system got the impression: 'If there is more resistance on the part of the human forces than three times, shoot them into death', based on the official document published in the TIE newspaper, which is not published by the local media.
Yerker Kayakhstan, 56, the leader of the Kego Kego Koto, deserved the situation out of hand and asked for violence to be restored and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen any more.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left on the beaches," he told the TIME 's chronic timber on the dead.
We still do not know who shot him, but created the ranks of the soldiers.
'The skirts were shot '.
Alfus Youwi was shot three times.
'Yohanes TIMEE, like many indonians, used just one name. '
'I saw him dead... '
Yotje Mende told journalists that the police were only 'protected' because it was the target of the attack.
'We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us', the spokesman for the Papua police, Mr Pudjo Sulido, said by 2015.
"Then it is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many injured.
The day after Jakara was murdered.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a speech in Jayaya expressing his sympathy with the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
'I want this case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again. '
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Mr Wirana, said that he would start enquiries outside the legal system of human rights violations.
He started to withdraw his speech.
'The majority of infringements took place a long time ago;
In the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but that requires certain processes. "
In the interview in Jakarta between 5.6.2017 and he said that he did not intend to start enquiries in Papua.
"Everything will be clarified by the courts."
The UN accuses Mr Wirana of 'crimes against humanity'; these crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the tax vote on independence in East Timor in 1999.
The families of the victims are disgusting themselves.
'I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way ', as Mr Yohanes says.
'I am already tired of this'.
He says that he is still in fear, despite the fact that it has been going on for years.
"Yes," he says.
'I fear that the army will arrest me, and I fear I will be shot. '
His brother, Mr Yacobus, confirms that the banks do not dare to discuss this.
He says that he had been beaten by the soldiers when he had helped to burial four victims.
'The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are burial ', he says.
Ambassadors have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villages in the neighbouring region of Paniai.
One died and 17 injured in the conflict between the leader of the village and the building company, which began when the leader refused to take his train to hospital, including children.
A man who needed medical care was a man between two and four years old, Railanus Douw, who had had to fish in a close river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The wealthy villages demonstrated in the building country before the company office.
According to the police, the villages were stoned by police officers who responded with warnings.
According to the local authorities, however, the police force in Indonesia opened the fire to violence and killed one village.
'We are horrified: 'We fear revenge, says Dominggu Badii, who lives close to the hospital and saw when the injured was brought into care.
'I have hidden two days at home '.
Mr Deiyai's Parliament has called for the police officers shot to be held accountable and for the police force to be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real progress is feeding dissatisfaction with the Mee, Monia, Danes and Damalale that are living in the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement, OPM, the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of priests with random attacks and kidnapping the soldiers of the Indonesian army.
Some OPMs leaders are Panian, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the priests, Paniai is known as' a sad, forgotten place '.
Poverty breeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice in Enaroo, and that is too expensive for local people;
As is the case.
People are growing their food themselves: They are mainly babies and a certain amount of fruit and journalism.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five bars.
Most of the 100 are to the family and the rest is sold on the board.
Ten bars cost only 10 000 rings.
As time goes on, the differences between local and transporters have grown and the number of modifications has increased since new routes were opened to Nabir airport.
There are few jobs and generally go to better educated and wealthier local change.
Few people have sufficient capital and know-how to wheel their own businesses in a competitive way.
"Young people do not want to remain in the village because there is no work and no money," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai tribal Council.
The peripheral nature of Papua is of little importance in the world.
Moreover, the restrictions on international news are still tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Franck Escud and Basian Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been given a rare description, and the official reason was the inability to cooperate with the local institutions.
The Deputy Director-General of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kev, has not kept his electoral promises; he has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by lifting the restrictions on press reports.
'The most troubled protagonists in Indonesia are new risks for journalists from Papua and West Papua: A visa and a black list ', as Mr Kine said in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government only pressures the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, six countries in the Pacific - Tonga, laughter, Palau, subsidy, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - invited the UN Council of Human Rights to examine the 'numerous and widespread infringements' of Papua, including Paniai amputation.
They have traditionally supported the liberation movement in Papua.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that 'Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so that it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations'.
Local governments want to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation under the chairmanship of the human rights envoy, Kees Van bar, visited Jayaya 4.5.2017, the local delegation violated silence and expressed its desire for freedom, it is an anonymous source of stagnation.
Indonesia has presidential elections of 2019, but the Pakistani tell us that Jokowi will probably no longer be voting.
'Yokowi is good, but he is surrounded by people who have sleaked the Paniai amputation ', Mr Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the banks: They live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army, in a lack of health care and education facilities.
According to Mr Gobi, banks, like other priests, consider the votes he has given to Jokows to be a 'debt' which must be paid back.
"They do not want money; they simply want justice," he says.
Despite intimidation and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai amputation once again demonstrated a symbolic resistance: They buried one of the victims to a country which is opposed to the police station and the army.
They know that perhaps they will never get justice, but at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
'Yacobus says the end of the pressures'.
'What else? '
Dereck Chisora is burial about the withdrawal of Robert Helenius: 'Even his own fanatics do not want to see'.
A heavy series of boxers, Robert Helenus and Dereck Chisora, were due to take place on 27 May in Hartward.
However, it was for commercial reasons that it was withdrawn.
Chisora is flying in a recent interview with IFL TV for reasons of completely freezing the neo-offensive on the shoulders of Helsinki.
My dream in Finland was flat, but that was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fanatics do not want to see him abducted because he is misleading, Chisora suffers.
Helsinki and Chisora met for the first time in full Hartward in December 2011.
Helsinki won the game with a controversial judgment.
The sale of the ticket was very smooth and its protagonist Nisse Sauerland told Iltaland in May that it was postponed until the autumn.
There was nothing new about it.
However, it is no longer the case that Chisora will be spared.
After all, it would probably have had to be withdrawn.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I was struck by hard stones.
Tyren was explosive.
In the hospital it was said that I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The British says that it is in some 45th condition at the moment.
He does not seem to be interested in rethink with Helsinki, but in Dillia Whyte.
Chisora suffered the defeat of Whyte in December.
It came back to Dubai for the second time.
On Friday, hundreds of people had to escape 337 metres of high 79th floor building.
This was another fire within two years of war in a building called Torch.
The building was shut down and no one was known to have been injured.
'We were sleeping and burning the voices and people's drugs.
We protected the gateway from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes', the man of Georgia told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the rainfall came from four local times this morning and left the building behind.
The government announced that it would organise accommodation for those left.
This case may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used for high buildings in foreign affairs around the world.
Following the fire in the Torchi building in 2015, the board of directors commissioned a study which made it clear that the most affected people are the public's blood and the dissemination of their districts.
In Britain, the police believe that the spread of Grenfell Tower could contribute to rapid progress in the skies in the fire where 80 people died in June.
A mopo was stolen from an oral parent during the night.
It was stolen between 21 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from the NERA 2 address.
Mopo was his sea, Sky Team Monkey.
It is red, and the register is 27V.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.
The police are asking for evidence of the mysterious or anachronistic e-mail address to be protected from scotterbox.
You see the support for Joven Script. or a telephone for a police updating in order to be able to cope with the figure of 95 4320.
3.8.2017 p.m.: The police informed us that the mopo was found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take part in the aircraft, reveal the investigation into Question Time.
A survey of questions to air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or without knowledge of prohibited objects crossed the inspection points of the US TSA.
Less than 1% said that they had only been informed afterwards that they had transported arms, ammunition or explosives in error.
This questionnaire provided more than a thousand passengers, which was carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters, and it also reveals that young passengers are more likely to challenge the rules than others.
The ESA rules were deliberately sulphur-free, 19.7% were representatives of the generation and less than 15% were part of the X.
More generally, the rules were violated by putting food and liquid on board.
More than three per cent of women and 3.7% of men informed their exports of prohibited drugs.
The company carrying out the questionnaire wanted to see how many illegal goods had been exported by accident and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that those who travel most are also most likely to overrun security checks - consciously or without knowledge.
However, as the company that has drawn up the questionnaire says, the TSA guidelines are very complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what livelihoods can be exported and how much.
It is no surprise, therefore, that most of the ESA 's seizure is liquid.
There was also the belief that the plane should not be exported.
Barriers must be exported to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
The Director-General of the United States Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt, has wheeled his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obaman period.
A day after the 15 States had challenged the head of the US Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt, the leader of the EPA, has withdrawn his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce pollution during the Obaman administration.
According to Mr Pruiti, the change shows that the agency he chairs is more sensitive to the needs of decision-makers in the Länder in environmental matters.
Mr Pruitt did not mention a single position against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should start to comply with the requirements of 2015 on ozone at land level from 1 January onwards.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year, so that his office would have more time to look into the plan, because the agency 'does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth'.
He was the public prosecutor of the State of Okedo before President Donald Trump appointed him as the EPA leader.
Since Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions against the chemical industry and the industry using fossil fuels.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the latest setback to the Pruiti plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted the decision that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in trying to delay the implementation of the Obaman regime for oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce metal leaks.
In its opinion of Wednesday evening, Mr Pruitt claimed that his U-turn on the ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
'The EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected the groups of activists and others to take the right to reach an agreement on timetables', as Mr Pruitt said in his last speech, and to call the Environment Agency to court more than ten times.
'We do not believe in legal regulation and take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our actions and its powers. "
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt can continue to exercise its' powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers' in order to ensure that the provisions' are justified and are based on the best available information '.
The Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the decisions of 2015 by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in Senate.
EEP, which has been brought to justice this week by a coalition of Länder, was told by Eric Schneider that it was going to continue to exert pressure.
'EP change as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for the 6.7 million neyorists and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of rain in in their communities', as Mr Schneider said.
Not only New York, but also California, Connect, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, advertising, Massachusetts, Massachusts, New Mexesta, Orego, Pennippin, Vermont, Washington and Districh of Columbia.
Ozone in land is created when emissions from cars, power stations, oil refineries and chemical factories, for example, react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
This rainfall could cause serious respiratory difficulties for vulnerable groups, and it is also part of thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the dramatic change in direction in Pruiti.
'It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the cabinet responsible for our survival used common sense 'says Lori Burd about the centre of biodiversity.
'We must continue to fight the regime in Trumph, because its ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups that are in favour of their own interests'.
The car manufacturer is becoming a catalyst - '? In the style of Ferrer'.
It also intends to invest in hybridique sporting cars, while at the same time trying to maintain its expansive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen at the beauty of the Ferrer, the Director-General, Mr Marchiani, said the plans at the media conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents his five-year plan, Automatova News.
All cases of same type of virus in Austria
The disaster of the Rantasland is the same type of virus as in the past, namely information on THL.
On Thursday, the laboratories of the health and well-being institute have ensured that the five-thousand cattle infection from Austria is the same as previous infections.
THL has secured the same type of virus as the previous cases of Austria-Savo on Friday 28 July.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected by Austria SASAS relate to the first category of destruction that was detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because that means that we have no other type of destruction.
It is possible, however, that new infections can be presented between August and August, and it is therefore no longer over, the Doctor for infectious diseases in Soster's basic health care, Mr Mirkassa, says.
No new cases of destruction or suspicion have emerged after five confirmed cases.
It is still important, however, that everyone should ensure that their own vaccination protection is updated, as Erkina reminds us.
I should like to add that Mr Pirker secured three new categories of destruction - 'Father infection or epidemics are extremely unlikely'.
Finland is preparing for a licence shield.
The liquidation of the Pontika was not even considered to be legitimate.
The argument is that the process is producing a methanol which is toxic.
Preparation at home will be legal next year, but it will not even be thought about legalising the box.
Kileu is being prepared by means of use, and the driving force is being restored by Islam.
Behind the regulation of the Islam, the reason why the process is producing a methanol which is toxic.
No political will has been shown to make a sword 's right', government advice from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the Islam was not considered to be legalised.
It was not put on the political table either.
There was no debate on liberalisation, as the representative of the People 's Party, Mr Oui Mäyk, says.
He is at the negotiating table of the government parties which took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
In the future, even an application will not be granted at home.
Commercial manufacturing is also valid.
It is a simple rule for the domestic manufacture of alcoholic drinks: Alcohol can be manufactured at home.
This means that, in addition to beer, siller and wine, the home can make a kilogram legally.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law abolishes requirements for mafias and flavourings and allows the manufacture of a kilogram to be specified.
The manufacture must also be made in such a way that the mafias and flavourings that have arisen in connection with the use of these substances are clearly detected.
Under the new law, drinks can be manufactured as much as they like, and self-employed alcohol can be made a gift.
It must not continue to be sold.
In Finland, public health is no longer a problem. It is a belief.
A much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EEU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law is now before the Ministry of Justice.
As soon as the summer recess begins, the All Act will be on the table.
The plenary sitting is 5.9.
The law will come into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House had already adopted a position.
Oscar Pistorius was stoned to the hospital with armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius was stoned to the southern African hospital because of deep-rooted misgivings.
Pistorium has already been excluded from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is suffering prison sentences in Atteridevie.
According to a British newspaper, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning with armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from breast beaches, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison information officer confirmed that Pistorius was exported to the hospital.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family told us that the former top sportsman was in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the golden paralysis list of the Olympic Games for six years in prison for the assassination of his golden friend, Reva Sthrai.
In February 2013, Pistorius amputed Sthens.
Spam telephone conversations reveal the pressure exerted by Trumpi on Mexico to build a border wall.
The telephone conversations between the American President, Donald Trumpi, and the Mexican and Australian leaders have taken over Washington.
In a telephone conversation of 27 January 2017, Mr Trump invited the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieta, to stop his public speech about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
"You cannot say to the press" Mr Trump said. "
Mr Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published the first telephone call to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbullet, during which there was a heated exchange of views.
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbulli that the agreement that the United States would include refugees travelling to Australia is ridiculous, 'wretched' and 'stupid'.
Mr Trump stopped the telephone by saying to Mr Turnbullet that 'this was the most unpleasant telephone every day'.
Georgia's bloodshed: Activists restored the right to racist cynicism.
The Ford Mercury car goes beyond a number of violence in the small town of Monroe in the countryside of Georgia and continues to travel towards the small bridge of Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers and white drivers in the car, four armed men crashed the road before the car gets on the bridge.
The leader of a group, the man of the middle-aged who has fallen into the rubble, is taking a deep life from his husband and is passing through the wind.
Passengers are afraid.
'Roger, nice! 'The man gets asleep.
"Out of the car!"
The horrors violate silence when a young black man is taken away from the front.
Fortunately, this tragic event is nothing more than a repetition that was presented from 22 to 7 to 2017.
The shocks of shock are, however, real when the horror falls into the trap of 'Roger'.
Human rights organisations have returned to the bridge of Moore's Ford since 2005 to resist what happened in 1946, when Ku Klux Klanna lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malc and George Murray Dorsey.
Nobody has been accused of murder.
'It is perplexing that no one has been arrested over these years - although the murderers live amongst us and many have to know who they are? '- Tyrone Brooks says which will help in the restructuring of the fleet.
'it is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that puts our soul under pressure '.
Mr Brok is the 71th-year-old civil activist and the former representative of the Georgian Congress.
He is being rejumped, and it also reminds the people of Monrolla that injustice has never been rectified.
'We want those responsible to be brought to justice, we want to see things finally come to a conclusion and we want to recover the grief and reconciliation, but above all we want justice ', as Mr Brok says.
'We cannot recover and come to an agreement before we have the right. '
The health scientist is hiding the body of the victim who died in the massacre in Georgia from 27.7.1946.
According to the reports from the FBI, more than 50 men from Monrou and its surroundings were suspected of cynicism.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty parties have been free for decades, according to the activists, the motives of the cynicism have always been known at local level: Politics and the wall.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia were given the right, by the Supreme Court, to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, which took its decision in April and was held in the summer.
According to the FBI, a incident occurred at the time of the elections in which a black temporary farmer Roger Malcom timber, a whistle-blower, Barnet Hester, was killed.
According to Mr Brooi, Hester had a relationship with Dorothu and Doroat was wasted.
According to FBI, an influential white land owner, Loy Harbour, paid USD 25.7.1946 Malcoli 600 billion in guarantees against which he was released from prison.
On their home trip, Malcoli and Doroyn were following their Service, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The violence stopped their car before the bridge of Moore's Ford.
'The Harriso statistics and the organisation of the murders' appear in the FBI report.
'it is also obvious that there was a secrecy between the Länder and the local authorities, who were involved in murder and lost evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses'.
Mr Brok will be more concise.
'that was a assassination of voting rights'.
"They were murdered because they wanted to be told that they would do the same if they were to vote".
Cassandra Greene has been following the reversal of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
This proposal is extremely realistic and imprisonment, a description of appalling racism, which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States today.
It is difficult to look at this proposal, but it is even more difficult not to see what is meant by Mrs Green.
'We do not want to talk about cynicism, because we would have to face up to our own dark side '.
"But I cannot create a relationship with you if you do not hear me or do not want to hear what I have experienced."
The exercises of this year began in June and, on the first day, around 30 spectators - 10 black and haemophiliacs - met to listen to a summary from the Greenen.
Wade Marbaugh is the Deputy Guardian of Greenland.
He has presented the local Ku Klux Klank leader in reparation for years, but this role is always as difficult and counterproductive.
'There is a liquid because I am not myself ', Mr Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history should be kept on the table, so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the bad, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Bart Hester.
This proposal begins with a situation in which Malcom shouts and tears Hester, who is ravaging the fact that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothu.
'Net you not hear? 'I said that my taste, nice!'
Rascona, that is Hester.
Then you are going to beat.
And then all (at least all black exhibitions) sleep.
Greene laugh hardest.
'Why? '
He is in no way.
'It he asks? '
'No ', Greene heighten.
I do not believe that the White Paper used the word 'nice' at the time.
So ', the other black box confirms.
'it is a slander, you must use a longer version '.
The subject of the motion is unpleasant, but it is bad power.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the motion; they want to respect the memory of the dead.
The problem begins from the outset.
Now the words of Rascona are glorious.
No one laughs.
The rehabilitation will end quickly and in a violent manner.
Drugs, ferries - and silence.
Women who have fallen into black funeral are standing alongside the bodies and under Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is divided in every other word.
A few ten metres away, there were five watchdog and tears.
Almost half of the public is black and half of the white.
One of them is a couple which has come to look at Ithaca from New York, but the majority are local.
They have been through the guidance of Mr Broov in the printing reprisals of the victims in Georgia.
Murders have turned from the story and the tunnel is heavy on the ground.
After the Laulue, Greene invites a number of violence to check the bodies.
Children are able to look at the blood and the non-mobile bodies and crash each other.
'they are not really dead ', a small boy is beating like reminding itself.
In a few minutes' time, Mrs Greene will thank the public.
The showers who put forward the cynical samples rob their sign and wipe out tears.
Mr Marbaugh, the local leader Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona wants two exhibitions and then comes after the cynical beaches.
"No" is disgusted by the women involved in the proposal.
'We know that he is not.
You are doing so for good reasons. '
Later, the public and the spectators will meet for a common evening.
The white couples arriving in Altant are talking lively with the black couples that they have just met.
It is difficult for Denise Duplinsk to find words when he describes the feelings raised by the motion.
'It is difficult to listen to the horrific words and look at the atrocious acts that people say and make, who appear to be the same as you - precisely because they seem to be the same as you. '
'It is still the case, 'he added:' They are called detention '.
On the other side of the bad, Mr Brok takes note of the development of civil rights for listening to those sitting on the same table.
He is already saying that he has begun the planning of next year's proposal.
'The charity is a great experience, because it reflects the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a teacher experience ', Mr Brok says.
'The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it. "
Speeding up growth in the shops is disappointing: The removal of this' surplus' by means of a genuine saving.
Is it permissible to dissociate the dead's newspapers from trade even before calculating?
What about taking the anchor out of the bitter part - however much it presses?
The replies are very divided: For one, it is a sign of the nonsense that it has been exported, for others do not want to pay for the parts which are not used and which, however, go home.
The phenomenon is identified.
For example, there are bad carriages of vegetable in the Helsinki City, because many of them, for example, dissociated the bulldozers of the dead.
The newspapers are exported to biowaste.
According to the news published by the press, the new nonsense in the vegetable is a source of surprise to the dealers.
But how much will the elimination of surplus parts of vegetables actually save money before calculating?
How significant is this?
We women tested how the price will change when newspapers or positions are taken away by anchor, latcher, sleep, scaffolding and flowers.
Consumer: EUR 1.80 came at the price of a dead man who is paying EUR 2.10, when all the newspapers are removed from it.
Anan: EUR 2.30 cost a whole anchor, when it claimed that its position was withdrawn, totalled EUR 1.95.
On Latvia: EUR 2.60 price became EUR 2.40 when the short-term position disappeared.
Sleep: Two gentlemen paid 75 cents together.
Without a stock, sixty cents were paid.
General: A medium-sized coup paid EUR 1 and without a position of 80 cents.
In conclusion: If you leave the newspapers and the positions, you will save a few dozen cents at best in one case of hatred.
The price of hatred, considered to be 1%, fell by up to 20%.
It would have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a blanket agreement with the PSG for five years.
Brazil star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSGP.
It was reported earlier on Thursday evening that the representatives of Neymar had paid a football price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelon in the Spanish flag.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was in Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogbisa in France.
The Spanish flag was blocked earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first attempt by the representatives of Nymar.
According to the rules of the oligopoly, a club cannot pay directly for a purchase price. Instead, the player himself must buy out his contract, which is to be done by recycling money via the gold.
In practice, the PSG has paid a sum to Neymar and this representative who, through the leg of money, sent to Barcelona.
Mr Neymar is supposed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will probably be presented to the new home public at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA will examine the details.
Mr Barco also stated in his communication that he would provide information on the payment of UNEEF, so that the Association can determine the possible disciplinary measures.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish Consular, Javier Tebas, has suspected that the PSGP would violate the rules of the UEFA's economic fair play.
The UEFA can punish a loss of over EUR 30 million over three years.
According to UNEFA, the transfer of Nymar will not automatically break its economic chapter.
The transfer of Nymar to the PSGP will have an impact on the economy for many years, but it cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with considerable sums, and UNEF was informed.
PSGP owns the government to Qatar Sports Inwaterways.
As President of the Council, I am following the former tenderer, the Cape-Khelaifi.
Olympic Games to Nymar
Aust, 21, received the limits of more palpable encryption - the sludge fell into the safe seas of airports.
Austt Dunn had to take ordinary working measures on board a plane at a south-east International airport with a couple of workshops when suddenly a sail from a skies.
The power of secrecy triggered the plane in Dunn.
Dunn was rushed into the hospital.
He had a third-level fire injuries around the body.
My father warned me and told me that he received an electric shop and he is in hospital.
I asked, rather, whether he was in livelihoods, the guerrillas of Austini.
He spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the fires, he had fats and brain drain.
Experience was a beacon for the whole family.
That cannot be expected.
It is traumatic for everyone, Astumn says.
According to the representative of the airport, the secret warning system was on the spot and the hauliers themselves decide whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and reinvigorates business by cutting back.
On Friday, my British education team, Pearson, announced that 3 000 jobs would be cut and a 72% cut by 72%, by launching a new restructuring programme in response to pressure from its business.
According to Mr John Fallon, the chief job losses will be made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third savings programme, aimed at revitalising the downward business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of the Random House publishing company to its partners, Mr Bertelsman, who announced that it would keep its prospects for this year, with turnover increased by 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
The attack in Kabul: NATO soldiers died in the suicide attack.
The suicide bombers raged in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, which claimed that NATO soldiers and many others were killed.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were killed in the attack in the Qatar region.
On Tuesday, 30 people died in the mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in the attack on suicide bombers in Kabul.
According to NATO 's opinion, Thursday afternoon' s explosion took place when the collective partnership between NATO and the Afghan army was subject to 'attack by a person on an explosive equipment'.
The opinion states that the situation of all those injured was stable and treated in the United States of Baghdad.
According to the exporters, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISA terrorist organisation in QArar are of major concern to NATO forces near Baghdad.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in an suicide attack in Kabul in a region which mainly lives with Chiamen.
The Taliban declared themselves to be behind the attack.
On the last day in Kabul, over 150 people died in a bomb attack by the country's most devastating militias since the American-led forces plunged the Taliban regime in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan, when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the converters, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people 's confidence in the government, in its policy and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghana.
EPA is passing its decision to postpone the implementation of the exhaustion provisions.
The US Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, has wheeled its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce emissions from rain under the Obaman administration, a day after 15 countries had brought the Agency to its jurisdiction.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called 'ozone control' of 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, shows its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
'We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder ', the leader, Scott Pruitt, said in the Agency's opinion.
In June, the Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone levels by one year to October 2018.
On Tuesday, the Agency brought to justice 15 states controlled mainly by democrats, including Districh of Columbia, where it was illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's regime has sought ways of mitigating the modern environmental provisions of Barack Obaman, which according to him are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The Trumpi measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to EPA websites, ozone-containing air can undermine the activity of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
According to Sydney Herald, a person belonging to the leadership leaders had also sent building blocks to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be exported to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the safety checks.
The police do not specify why the company was interrupted.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a equipment separating toxic inertia and to take a stamp in a public place, for example a public transport tool.
The Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Republic, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One man has been released, but his hearings are also continuing.
Mr Nesta's Director-General: Renewable fuels did well.
The result of the oil refineries, Mr Neste, fell before taxes, but the forecasts were found in the second quarter of the year.
According to the Director-General, Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales of renewables rose in record terms and the turnover of marketing & Services was heading in the right direction.
Last year's comparative turnover improved the US Tax Crets tax relief.
According to Mr Lievi, the turnover of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales rates and a more favourable market, even though tax relief expires.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our clients and our growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments that we have already announced in 2017, as Mr Lievon said in a communication.
Messy Garcia and Vasyl Lomatski are discussing possible matches at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatsu and Messy Garcia, who should be at a collision rate towards the most interesting boxing of the near future of less than 6.7 kilograms, met on Thursday, for the first time.
Men were in their own room in the possession of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles until the winners of the WBC, Messy Garcia, greetted the Lomatis, the Mayor of the WBO 's superior Speaker.
Mrs Garcia won Show by a unanimous decision of the former World Cup, Adrien Broner, and since Saturday, Garcia and Lomatko have been among the five best on the list.
Garcia took his hand and asked: 'How do you go?
Good luck! '
Lomatis defends its rapporteur, Mr Marriaga, at the ESPN channel on Saturday.
When the two photographs were dismissed, Egis Klimas pointed out that the male match would be 'complete for the dogs'.
'I am a former layer ', Mrs Garcia reminded us.
'I went from a set of superior [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I am not so big.
I am a small shield of 63.5.
I want to come back to a light.
He has to go into a light span [61.2 kg], and then we can take it.
That is what our fanatics want.
They will fulfil their wishes'.
Lomat was in agreement.
"Boxing needs to be taken."
Mr Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on a liquid basis, and that is part of his strategy for Lomatski, that is to say that Lomatis debatko devil in a light series later this year will be taking place next summer against Garcia (370, 30 disgust profits), which would also be of interest to Mr Jorge Lines and Mr Luampelles-Luampelles in Campelles and Mr Linet in Dr on 23 September.
'This could be on the way, because fanatics have asked for it ', Mrs Garcia said and later declared that she was prepared to take a stand on a channel which offers the best remuneration package.
'We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else gets as much attention.
As soon as an agreement is reached... "
Mrs Garcia said that she appreciated Lomatista as an incredible broker and perhaps she intends to look at Saturday.
Lomzenko broke up the beaches of Garcia and said that this master of three nightmare from Riverbean seemed 'truly slow'.
Mrs Garcia said that she concentrated first on the slogan and then on the boxing.
Men said that they wanted to become increasingly involved.
"This is the game that is expected.
No other match attracts just as much attention and interest.
As Mrs Garcia said, I am definitely involved.
Lomat said that he had expected to accept the best.
It will be a fine joke. "
Average salary of EUR 5 300, education - the situation of investment advice - was' wild and free '.
The quality of investment advice has been much talked about recently.
The last time, Helsinki told us about Ritta, 68, to which the investor of the banker's box spoke completely when he sold investment products.
The rules on investment advice and the various sales of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
The tightening-up is based on the new financial market directive, which is to be applied at the beginning of next year.
At present, an evaluation of the knowledge of investment advisers and investment workers who sell investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define the skills requirements.
The financial sector itself recommends that investment workers should carry out their own Athens or Apt..
The financial sector has helped to provide for the organisation of studies on the ApCs, whose investigation team is composed of experts from both financial control, universities and industry.
The qualifications are between 1215 and 12 study points, and their tenders draw up a wave EE, that is to say the Union's Executive Services Oy.
The net boxes tell us that, in general, both tents are 'very broad in terms of requirements'.
The catalogue of qualifications includes 1015 books, as well as numerous other lessons and works.
The Executive Director of Oyo Savelo tells us that the number of children passing through is around 70%.
As far as the staff of the major banks are concerned, more or less all investment services have carried out either Athens or Apper, because they are mandatory in accordance with their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers' names, without mentioning those whose staff seem to have been affected, Mr Saviko says.
According to him, there are 'few' movements of this kind.
According to Saviko, 13 000 to 14 000 people and more demanding research into Apyrio for investment advisers have been carried out since 2000.
Some bankers believe that this is an advantage.
A number of other areas of activity have significantly stricter knowledge requirements.
Mr Savello says that a recommendation made by the financial sector requires an Appendix study, because that is where knowledge in the investment sector will be ensured.
According to the Centre, several thousand euros per month have been passed on average by financial and investment advisers, including profitability, and income premiums.
The average salary level is about EUR 5 300.
On average, men in positions of tasks know over EUR 5 900 per month, and women also exceed EUR 4 500.
The tenth most deserving of an average of around EUR 8 100.
The dozens of the most densely populated men earn more than EUR 9 000 a month or more, one tenth of women who know the most.
Investment advice under the investment law can only be issued by a licensing company.
So far, self-regulation has been created at the level of employee and tasks.
According to Mr Fava, it received individual cases in which the investor 's skills and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the advice' s activities.
It is also possible, in principle, to sell investment products, even if skills and qualifications are at a disadvantage.
On the basis of this, the situation has been wild and free.
More sectors of activity have significantly stricter knowledge requirements, as Mr Savello says.
According to Mr Savello, this will be tightened up from the beginning of next year with the new directive on the financial markets (MiFID II).
This means that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently qualified.
Financial control, for its part, has the power to determine what is to be done.
Marko Hovi, the leader of the Fava market, says that one of the current clear changes is the legislation on the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investment products.
According to the hot, the new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms and to stakeholders who sell products on behalf of a company.
Mr Hovi says that, according to the government's proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Mr Fiva has the power to determine know-how and experience.
It will be decided on exactly what they are.
The company will also have to provide for the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and supplementary training.
All this must be documented, and the company has a duty to show that this has also been done.
Mr Hovi specifies that, in practice, a company must, for example, map out the staff 'work on an individual basis.
This will certainly be different, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the hot, the new requirement is also to work with a more experienced time limit if knowledge or experience are insufficient.
In other words, if a company employs a new worker who does not fully meet the criteria, the worker will have to work with a person who fulfils the criteria.
Hot air tells us that the rules are being tightened up and put into practice.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of 2018.
The picture is: 787 Dreamliner aircraft surrounded the United States of America with a waste aircraft.
The plane was sidelined by the United States in the Flightradard 24 service.
On Thursday, the flight was carried out by 787 Dreamliner, which tested the long-term sustainability of the Rolls Royce engines.
The aircraft left Seattle for 18 hours and for 1 minutes 15 700 km long than any permanent commercial retail in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States.
It went through 17 Länder.
Imatra's perseverance schoolchildren are not being exported with the help of the baby or the sunshine - Iines Kajesty machine - perseverance with the help of the baby village.
Iines Kajesty went well, followed by Talways Itlem.
The Imatran beaches round Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Although sometimes hundreds and then flew again, young bathers are not at fault, Talways Itingen.
In this week's baby school, a bathing site is shrinking from 13 children, 10 next week.
It seemed that the number of children in the coming week was already starting school and pre-herd.
The Imatra Coalition Centre is organised in cooperation with sport and the town of Imatra.
On Thursday, the bathing bathing was a nice tunnel.
I wonder if the baby beaches and young beaches were to retreat on the surface of the bathing polls, somebody from the air.
There were also smaller guerrillas.
Iines Kajesty, 5, first thought of going deeper into water.
However, he was encouraged by Talways Itleen to burn on the beaches.
Well done!
Iines Kajesty said that he had a lot in baby this summer.
He is a good bathing.
Like Iines Kajesty, a bag was practised with the bathroom, Vili Huhtan, 5.
That too was to be welcomed by the achievements of today.
Jami Kallio, 4 and others wanted water to be watered down.
The beaches of her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, the beaches, Ilena Villberg keeps a good start to a doctrine of utility.
Although the weather has been what happens, Anna has been fooled to go here every day.
Sometimes, we had to get through.
The schoolchildren were shut down.
Boys walked up with a fine found off the beaches.
Miland Lussina, 3, and Anna Villberg spread on the ladder, naked fruit and fled the day.
The lesson has already been learnt, but there was no rush.
That is not part of the summer.
Unknown soldiers sell water companies - "There is a semantic and combined story."
All kinds of things can be seen.
A few days ago, Sinland, which produces civil products, fertilised a non-known military test.
In other words, 'writers and beaches', as well as' writers'.
An unknown soldier refers to the films and marketing of their first flight in the autumn.
Yet there is something peculiar about this combination, and products have been cut off from the social media: When will the health links come?
We have to go and ask ourselves what this is all about.
What is to be said by the Deputy Executive Director of Sinatte, Aino Méry?
We are a partner for cinema.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and golden cinema, as he says.
According to him, products will become specialist and cinema will thus gain visibility.
Is this not a bit nice - often when you think that products and associated stories have something common?
Yes, it is a semantic story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, as Méry says.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish fundamental values, which are supported by those who have seen an old unknown military.
And cleaning up is not foreign to military culture, as Mr Méry points out.
Other business partners of unknown military film are, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and harvest.
So far, the market has been put on the market, for example, in Hartward, Hietana and Kosova.
Tour products have already been recovered by Finnish Kuvaleur bosses in Kallunn
There are also coffee and clover.
I would point out that there is still time left for the first time in the cinema, so we still have to go on.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, such as Valio, refineries, Neste and the German retail chain, Lidl, Kinnunen.
New results were published
The most recent results of medical age tests in Sweden have been published.
Earlier this year, the Swedish National Medicinal Office started a test.
The tests will be able to assess the age of asylum seekers more closely than before; a new test was introduced after the Swedish immigration agency was criticised for failing to define the real age of those who claim to be minors.
So far, the Agriculture Agency has commissioned 6 880 tests and the results of 2 481 tests have now been published by the Legal Affairs Agency, which took place between the middle of March and the end of July in 2017.
Of the 80% tested, 2002 was identified as over 18 years of age, and the Legal Affairs Agency established 25 cases in which it was' possibly 18 years old or older '.
432 cases concluded that asylum seekers are 'possibly less than 18 years old'.
The tests were carried out only where there were grounds for suspicion of the age announced by the applicant.
Johan Gothenburg legal agency tells us that the results are in line with the results of previous months.
'The figures are quite consistent, "he told The Local.
Although most of the applicants were identified as over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that they had complained about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and declared that 442 cases had "indications that the investigation would be carried out by the 18-year-old or older".
When Mr Dagbladet looked at the same results, it became clear that 243 cases had openly told the applicants that they had fulfilled 18 years this year.
The medical evaluation method used in tests takes arrogant images of wisdom and magneet pictures of polills and then toothphones and radiologists analyse images.
One sceptics is the endogenology of the Karoline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes an evaluation of the biological maturity of people, which will determine whether the person has become murderer in the normal past or later.
'I have had reason to think about this, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological life in this way is extremely uncertain.
If we are certainly unable to define the age, we should not pretend that we can do so, he said to the Metros newspaper.
At Gothenburg, however, the Legal Affairs Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: 'It may be said in general that the risk of identifying a child as adult is small.
It is the greatest risk in a situation in which tests are soon to be carried out for 18 years, with a risk of around 10%. "
Ilonen collapsed 30 pigs in Scotland.
Five more than a priest results in the third round spent Mikko Ilosen 's 30 pages on a bottom-down competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday 11, but at the end of the round there were 41.

It was also difficult for others.

Governor of West Virginia is changing party.
On Thursday evening, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Jim Jihad, announced that he would change party during the Trumpi campaign.
'Democracy simply rejected me ', as Mr Jihad said.
'I can tell you today, after many routine and in-depth deliberations... today I will tell the West Mayor that I can no longer help you as the Governor of democrats. '
The public expressed outrageous applause.
'The Republican party registered tomorrow added '.
'There is the time for a new game '.
Mr Trump promised earlier that the campaign in West Virginia would be made a significant announcement.
Mr Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because he did not support the democrats' candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Mr Forbesi, he was elected Governor in 2016.
He inherited a mining company and owns coal brains in five states.
His property stands at approximately USD 1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of Republicans (RNC) published the opinion that 'the party exchange of the Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party which is building up barriers rather than better America'.
"Democrats only have 15 governors and fewer Länder than ever before, and in this situation Mr Justice's announcement is the last step towards a party which has no leadership whatsoever and which is unable to find a positive message, which unites people," the representative of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel CSS, said in his statement to news.
The damage caused by the Salvador - on Thursday - is even becoming a very early anniversary of the summer.
From week to week, the bag will also be made available to Ethiopia Finland.
Over the past week, particularly in the central and north of the country and in the Warsaw region of Finland.
During the night of Wednesday and Thursday, the secret attacks caused many fires.
According to Medoros, Thursday may become a very baby day in the summer.

Over the past week, particularly in the central and northern regions of the country and in the Warsaw region of Finland.
By holding the House to the electric centre of rice, there is a small fire.
On Wednesday, the Pelvention Institute received a notice of a salary of about midnight.
At the end of the winter, the centre was located at the season.
The Pelassies Institution unleashed the bitter and the wall in order to find a return and a smokescreen.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
At the end of the day, the secrecy once again stepped up the militias of the external border in Harati before midnight.
When the rescue plant was there, the building was already in full swing and the rescue company could only prevent it from spreading.
The total external border of about fifty square metres was brought up to date.
In the Registrip of Kuopia, once again, the biscuit of the home home.
The people of the House were outside the building and proved a sectarian attack.
The Pelvention Institute was there to check the case, but this time it was not possible to bring about a fire - just a few merits.
As far as transport is concerned, the bag caused problems with the train between the Seavia and the Vaasa, when the hidden blow damaged the system of traffic control.
Information on wine was made on Thursday morning between eight and nine, and then the train was replaced by birds.
The problem was only resolved a little before five afternoon.
Since then, trains have been allowed to continue normally with a ramp of bag.
The people of Finland have sown disaster.
However, it has been relatively small this summer.
These utilities have been completely indiscriminate this summer and the meteorological Jari Thalvine, which updates the aeronautical system.
As far as Wednesday and Thursday are concerned, bathwater has been largely confronted, but thanks to the limited salmonella of the summer, it also appears to be strong in many cases.
This might seem to be a hard uproar, but that is what it has been, in comparison with the bag of this summer.
On Wednesday, the stretch of land was 1 700 times, and Thursday has had the potential even for the hardest anniversary of the summer: Around 16 p.m. there were 1 790 countries.
If encryption continues to take place at the beginning of the evening, it will be possible to achieve more than twenty thousand encryption.
The previous record year was experienced in 2015, with around 30 000 paragraphs.
By Wednesday this year, 18 386 countries had been kept secret.
So there is still room for improvement so that this year does not break the 'record' of two years ago.
However, the Ukrainian people can expect to continue.
According to the rule, the air on Finland will remain hot and reprisal in the last week, which is the natural environment for which it is born.
The main weight of the King will be transferred from Saturday to the south, where around 2 000 clandestine days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more homogenous sample in the central parts of the country.
That is the kind of uproar.
Coe applauds Russia 's' open-minded 'apologies for the Day of doping.
The World Against Sebastian Coe praised the excuses that Russia presented on Thursday because of the doping scandal, but added that it was not time to lift the Russian ban.
The Russian general sporting leader, Dmitri Shlitht, said at the IAAFO Congress on Thursday that the ban that Russia has received is appropriate and that he intends to combat doping resolutely.
He said that he regrets' on behalf of all sportsmen and women who were driven into competition by a golden or honey house '.
Despite his comment, the IAFO Congress voted in favour of extending the ban, which was excluded from the general sports competition in November 2015, after evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
'I believe that his reply today was very direct, which was a very generous proposal ', as the President of the IAAFO, Mr Coe, told journalists.
'The Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian General sports federation admitted that it was going through difficult times and that it was doing everything in its power to reorganise its activities'.
Mr Coe said that he was' also 'pleased that Russia accepted the conditions for a moratorium to be lifted.
'I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but the Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the time to lift the Russian ban ', as Mr Coe said.
'We must do everything in our power over the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean sportsmen and women separate from the system of tourism, which he added.
Nine Russian sportsmen and women are competing with a neutral sportsman, at MMAFO, which began on Friday in London, who have met the strict criteria of IAAFO.
On Monday, the leader of the IAFO Group, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still has to meet a number of requirements before its position can be restored.
'This testing is still inadequate and the whites who have obtained a ban are still free ', he told the journalists to the IAFE Council on Friday after his presentation in London.
The company disappointed the poor success of the Tom of Finand film.
Tom of Finland was not the success that the authors wanted.
If it is said in all honesty, I am disappointed that the film produced by the interview between Annika Sucksdorff and the leader of Helsinki.
I was afraid that the Finnish cinema could be Conservative and it seems that it is.
The cinema received its first appearance in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached 100 000 viewpoints, compared with the film budget, around EUR 5 million.
No holiday profit came from this, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful in the country of origin, they would already have had their money.
We now have to wait for small clubs to spread abroad, as Mr Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is the cinema run by Dome Karuvu.
The financial rules will affect the transfer of Nymarn to Paris.
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Nymar from Barcelona to the French Paris Sainti Geres, the most expensive football transfer ever.
Its possible sanctions for the PSG will be decided by UEFA, which can prevent the presence of teams from being respected.
In 2011, the UEFA introduced the economic rules of fair play, according to which the PSGP must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Nymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelon was paid EUR 222 million for the closure of the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary in Nymar is around 10 million dollars per year.
There are many economic aspects to the transfer of Neymar to France.
PSGP has no difficulty in paying for the transfer of Nymar and incorporating him in a daughter article, as it is following to fund the regime that is rich in the oil slick in Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on the purchase of players, but they need to be balanced on real sources of income so that football business is not defeated.
The rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the French President of the UEFA in 2007, Mr Michel Platin.
As a former football star, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was shattering and causing serious problems if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair economic rules was shifted from the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
This change meant that, for the first time in Chelsea in 2003, the business model used by Roman Abramovski was significantly hampered.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play will last until 2018, during which the clubs will be able to do no more than EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the UEFA chairman's tasks scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, wants to control the uncontrolled spending of clubs.
'The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future ', Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the economic rules of the UEFA, told the Office last week.
Although PSG paid out of his agreement with one-off compensation, it can keep the amount in accounting for the whole duration of his new agreement.
Mr Neymar has entered into a five-year agreement, so that the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual figure of EUR 4.4 million for the next five years.
In 2014, the first sanctions against the PSGP and Manchester City, funded from Abu Dhabi, were distributed on the basis of fair economic rules.
The PSG has received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was set to be limited to its 21 players for the period 2014 to 2015, rather than the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is monitoring clubs who may try to circumvent its economic provisions by increasing their income through the companies involved.
If, for example, a secular company supports PSGs, but the value of aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, then the UEFA will not reduce aid to a actual income.
This was when the UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar tourist Authority for the PSGP was overloaded.
It has also become clear that some of Nymarn's merits could be financed in Qatar by means of payments from the MMGs Competition Commission in 2022.
The PSG and the organisational Committee have, however, denied that Neymar would be made by the Ambassador to Mount Competition, which would be very easy to reveal.
As a result of previous sanctions by PSG, the UEFA is following the rules even more closely than usual.
On Thursday, the sources that are familiar with the situation told us that the UEFA had not negotiated with the PSGP on the transfer of Nymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Official Prests Office, provided that their identity is not revealed because they have no mandate to discuss the situation in the PSG.
According to the latest public accounts, the turnover of the PSGP during the period 201516 was EUR 52.4 million and a turnover of over EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Nymar to attract new sponsors and to increase the sale of followed-up products and toilers.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Nymar Agreement.
From the departure of the world 's best player, the Spanish flag tried to make it more difficult to move Nymar, which was alleged to be a breach of the economic rules of fair play.
'This is a clear economic case of doping, both for the club and for the state ', Javier Tebas, the President of the Spanish Consular, said to the Spanish newspaper ASS, which referred to the PSGP's indiscriminate possession.
Arsenal's manual Wenger also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club.
'The case is the result of an owner who has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years', Mr Wenger said on Thursday.
'It is possible after the state owns its football team.
It will be extremely difficult to comply with fair economic rules; there are so many interests associated with the famous player representing a state. "
It is a matter of urgency: Finnish athletes in Helsinki
The Pajesty Speaker, Artina Pajesty and the three Kristina Määäyan, is in the gates in Helsinki, even though he should be complaining about the general sport in Mukorn in London.
Mr Mälinen may have to compete without consulting his whoever.
Tomorrow, a Pajesty will compete in the shrimps of a long shell and Mr Määänte in the shrimps of trio.
But the Catholic whites, the Armenian Ghazzara, has not received a visa in Great Britain.
Mr Ghazzara has tried to deal with this issue in the British Ambassador without any results.
The public owner is invited to MMs as documentation, but that too has not been able to obtain a visa.
I wonder whether this is the first symptoms of Britxist or what the Executive Director, Jorma Kempaine, said.
He has always been successful in the past, but there is now a problem.
He will do everything he can to get there.

Much in Finland from London requires miracle.
Today, in London, the MMMs competitions will start on Friday and last the week on Sunday 13 August.
Sport, landscape and ice sportsmen are the species in which Finnish penal athletes will be passionate from one year to the next, whether successful or not.
The hearts of sportsmen and women are measured.
There are, of course, other indicators.
Less attention remains to be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young sportsmen and women, who, by acquiring experience, are capable of making sportsmen and women work to a level that is genuinely possible.
Now, there are no young sportsmen and women in the small MMMM team in Finland.
The MMMP for Finland is asking for miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport are that they can also be astonished.
It draws nearer sportsmen and women around television and smiles to watch the large ones, even though London's mentality is only settled at night due to the resignation.
With regard to the previous MMs, Finland received one gonstrol.
It was presented by the Speaker, Mr Tero Pittigaki.
Even now, the brains are waiting from Pittu, even though others tell us the results of recent times by him and others, as well as the fact that the Pittu was left at the forefront of last summer.
Whatever happens, the Pitellar remains a great Finnish sportsman in history.
For other Finnish sportsmen and women, access to final competition or making their own record is a good thing enough.
Hope and faith in the realistic minerals in the years ahead of Finnish general sport will be a good success in the international arena of young people this summer too.
The proclamation of young talents and financial support for their work are more important than maintaining a small elite of representatives.
Success will not come at once, it will require a great deal of hard work and patience from sportsmen and women, both in terms of education and in terms of penal sportsmen and women.
The Finns can also appreciate international sporting stars and enjoy their unique performance.
It is to be hoped that the London cats will remain in the history of Upper Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of fear or cowardice attacks, for example.

A small circle: Wet in America Summer and Comrade Detit
The story is simultaneous both of the days of the Lower 80s and of the Global Century (the time David Wai and Michael Showalter made a splendid State TV) and of their own time - 2001 - before Elizabeth Banks, Ammed Poey, Paul and others were moving to a larger championship.
It is both a coup and a description of the constant memory we have missed in the Faceyo era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for a long time.
The First Day of Camp operated surprisingly well, not just because of its absolute humour (it was, for example, reported in H. Jon Benjam 's voice as the background to the vegetable table.)
At the heart of the joke is that medium-sized spectators seem to be showing the passionate theatres that are approaching full life, which makes it impossible to achieve the past part of the joke.
Years later, where adults appear to be adults, is less well-known, and its parameter is more fragmented: It improves, for example, Stalinism in the nineties, as a horrific film bleed by the poor.
There is one point in which the Aple Powerboy, the insider species and the 'other street of 1991' are missing.
Many of the stories are the same as in the past.
Good heart Coop (Michael Showalter) is now the author, but has still not been able to get over Marguerche Moreau.
Victor (Ken Marino) is still stuck.
And George H. W. Bush, which appears to be well documented by Michael Ian Black Black, is involved in a madness.

But that is not much.
There are a number of good whisky identities (policemen spend time watching television scapegoats in the same way as the Americans are watching football).
There are a number of famous voices, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlolodge Sevigny.
Comrade Detive, however, remains too tight to tracking down the Socialist drama - for example, the killer hiding behind the Reaganmare morning - which is why a series often starts with a rather clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the vocabulary of SARS is not sufficiently rapid or generous.
In short, a series could function better as an agittle, for example when Gregor and Iosf repeatedly go to the United States Embassy and there are always two men in the skies.

Kouvolian Tony Tauru is coming up on Saturday in Macau - in response to the former UFCC.
Tony Tauru wants to keep the game.
Tony Tauru is getting his answer in Macau because last year a Brazilian Leandro was still in the UFCR.
Brazil also has a black boy and a World Cup of the species.
For once, I am against my parents.
It is a bitter cheque, Mr Tauru, who is 32,years old.
Last Saturday, the people of Kouvolia had to rise in Indonesia.
It was cancelled because of the logistical problems, but three struggles were won by a quick timetable for the Chinese Autonomous Community in Macau.
Mr Tauru has not met in the past.
This was the first time that my sleep was withdrawn.
It has irritated because preparation and my time took.
The complainant is pleased, however, that a new date has been set for the struggle.
The expectation of a week does not have much effect on preparations.
The transfer does not affect the situation, because it does not improve every week.
A municipality can become even worse if it is too much.
Mr Tauru has met opponents in his previous struggle, whose strengths are in a position to overcome.
This time things are different.

He is a rather aggressive player.
In the first place, he comes hard and tries to travel.
He has won the World Cup, so he knows the weight.

New motivation
A number of free-lighteers are sleeping up once a year, some of them are more rotting.
For example, the last time in September the future opponent was absent.
Last year, there were three matches.
We are now faced with the second battle this year.
Sometimes it has become a burden.
Over the last few years, I have taken up and been in good condition.
However, I have only taken note of this.
When the thirty-two-year-old person heard about the forthcoming meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espou and was able to do so again.
We have had some really good trees, including one cabinet in Sweden.
It was a great help, because on Saturday the Sunday of Hungarian people will have to be prepared for their physical struggle.
I have been given the opportunity to speak against the same-level opponents and to exercise the ability to act.
It is therefore the 322th-year-old main tactics.
We must behave in a sensible way.
If there is an opportunity, I will, of course, leave myself to export a tonne.
The protagonists must not be allowed free of charge, for they are the ones who consume the most.

The Bank of England has an interest rate of 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates as it has been in economic growth and that the reduction of inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow rate.
The decision-makers in the Central Bank's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided to increase by 0.25% this month.
In its tentative annual inflation report, the bank fell to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecasts for 2018 to 1.6%, and it warned that the level of income for households will be put under greater pressure because inflation is still expected to increase close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the Bank, however, interest rates will be necessary over the next few years to reduce the rate of inflation stepped up by Britxy, and the bank declared that the cost of loans could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexitsis referendum.
The Bank will end the Term funding programme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to provide cheap funding to banks at a cost of EUR 15 million, that is to say EUR 115 million.
The protocol of the bank 's card states that, according to the predictions of the Commission on monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years as the actual income of households reduces consumption.
As far as interest rates are concerned, the bank reiterated that, in order to curb inflation, there is a need for a 'somewhat more general' increase in monetary policy.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in 2018 in the third quarter and in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and a 1.7% increase for next year.
Now it was kept to 1.8% of its growth forecasts for 2018.
The pound was weakened in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
In relation to the dollar, the pound fell by 0.5% and was USD 1.31: 0.4% less than the euro and EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after the expected increase in the rate of growth in interest rates, which increased by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but a little fragmentation at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation survey gave little hope to households suffering from heightened inflation and low wage increases.
The bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent 'falling income' in the next few years, but it expects a 'significant' recovery at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a sharp increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak balance, which will override some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
This decision was taken a year after interest rates were calculated to 0.25%, after the result of the EEU referendum, which was sorely eaten.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of this decision will probably only start to become apparent in prices and the economy in four years' time.
Before the most recent decision by the Central Bank, interest rates had begun to be called for more and more vigorously, as inflation put pressure on households, and three decision-makers called for a 0.5% interest rate in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9%, but according to the Bank it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the increase in its target of 2% was due to a 'totally' poor balance.
In view of the recent drop in swaps cards, competition in the housing market would appear to be even more acute when creditors apply for clients and want to end the year with a strong desire to ', he says' Corece Mortgage Brokers'.
'The market seems to be particularly good for those who are at the end of the current loan agreement, which is even more popular, whose interest rates are low and which also offers non-cost alternatives'.
NHS number 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
From September onwards, patients will be required to be subject to the 'HIVs', the Supreme Court concluded the dispute concerning the funding of a medicinal product in the English public health system.
NHS declared that pre-exposure treatment (PREP) provides about 10 000 people during the first three years of experiment, and before that medication is found to reduce some 86% of infectious diseases by individuals.
NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS will be able to pay PREPEPP, even though it is claimed that it should be funded by the local authorities.
The leader of the English NHS, Simon Stevens, called the 'significant new intervention' decision announced on Thursday, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as a 'crucial moment'.
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffieland, the first to accept a reporting experiment which will be extended in October to other clinics.
Pre-contracting (PrEP) must before cynically take up HIVE, which reduces infectious diseases.
Tests have shown that the PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A medicinal product before being cynical means that there are sufficient medicinal products in the body that prevent HIV infection.
A medicinal product can be taken on a daily basis or two hours before sex.
The target group includes homeopathies, Biscuits and transgenics, as well as people with a positive partner HIVs, which does not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose to comply with the conditions of experimentation with applicants from men, women and transcendants and those who are not known to receive anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and who have been informed of medical treatment can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health clinical.
The programme will cost GBP 10 million, and this week the English NHS signed an agreement on medicines after international tendering.
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the potential of the PREPER by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its destination, taking and carrying out its treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and streamline the existing wide-ranging and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV", Mr Stevenson.
'It is yet another major achievement in the fight, which has been going on for more than 30 years, to resolve the greatest human health challenge. '
'This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV ', the leader of the National AIDS Organisation, Deborah Gold.
'PrEPEP 'may well affect those who need it and risk groups, but it could have a retroactive effect on the HIVs epidemic in England.
From September onwards, those who are at risk will receive a medicinal product whose use they will be able to decide independently without the need to negotiate with the partner, which will have an impressive effect which will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome. "
'The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group falls outside it 'says the leader of the Terrence Higges Foundation, Mr Ian Gree.
'PrEPEP 'has been produced and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people belonging to risk groups from HIV infection.'
'PrEPER experiment is a welcome event, which has lasted for no good reason for several months because of the government's delay ', Mr Sharon Hodgson, the Minister for Health of the shadow government.
'We have evidence that medicinal products can have a retroactive effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop this threat of disease spreading.
This experiment will help us to understand the real benefits of the PrEPP.
It is now important for this experiment to be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and make a further step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been able to stop. "
Quality of life: Inertia and fibres have made the home of the small Earl's Court a place.
The former banker, Joe Leigh Leigh, who was enthusiastic about the refinement of buildings, moved from the Earl's Courte region to a smaller housing in 2014.
The housing is on the first floor of the Horn Annan era: The success of many of them is that Joanne has not yet fled his fights and changed.
'Yoanne says that before I lived with me.
'I looked for something similar to that in my category of prices.
I was here to live and noticed that the bad were as high as my home at the time.
I was wonderful immediately and made a offer on the same day. "
Since then, around 90 square houses have experienced a complete change in form.
It was a twofold one, in which only a photograph was allowed, and you wanted more preservation and liquid in order to make use of the room.
'I wanted space, great windows and a great deal of light.
They were my demand, "he says.
Mr Erfan & Shed was appointed to work on the Efan Azady planning office in the Azadic Hille, whose task was to make use of almost four metres of high office and to create a housing site which is not just a remond and selling target but a home.
It was not quite enough to duplicate two situations, so the challenge was to build an intervals where it stood.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfanatics.
'The structures are quite complex.
The farms had to be organised overlapping in such a way that they do not need to be mature.
The structures had to be adjusted in such a way that the superiority is exactly the right one, both on the ground and on the spot. "
Erfan was able to duplicate the state with two full, heightened complicity.
The dirty window of residence is opened up in Rettivius.
Yesterday's rooms, hedge efficiency and Serge Mouille's gear are a slogan.
This theatre, knowledge and light.
The soft at both ends of the short corridors will be allowed to influence the real longer.
The window of air is like a window which opens up the prospect of another room.
The guerrillas of the mission have a preservation space for the aeroplane of Joanne and for shelter.
The fact that the spring is allowed to be disguised when it is not used is added.
The boxes fitted on the Taitis are not a new solution;
But the Joanne Spring is unique in raising the door in the same way as the door to the car station.
"It called for a little planning, Erfan says of the steel-fired MDF door.
'It is balanced, that is to say it is very easily brought to its place. '
With the rational use of farms and conservation plans, Mr Joanne has obtained 16 extra squads, another taste and a better basis.
The 'housing on the market' sector will decide - or the value of the property ', as Erfa says.
"In the basic case, the estate carries on to housing and falls on the basis of the surface."
The Joanne surface area was added by the use of high-quality materials that bring the opportunity to luxury.
'Interior is in contact with non-residential materials, and you know the housing is partly based on it ', as Erfan says.
'There is no one who is interested in electric power in the wall.
They too are important but not the same. "
The housing of Joanne is an example of the fact that good planning and licensing can make the basic home exceptionally good.
It may also happen that there is no wish to change the housing.
A pregnant player, Sofia, was radiated in its summer recess.
In Prince, the election of Sofia was married.
In Prince, Sofia was represented at Borstad in Sweden for the last time before she was born.
A Sustainable Tomorrow was elected by a penny of the penny.
Sofia was represented on this occasion as a smile.
In Sweden, Sofia has been visiting Bugstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented at the Acuinable Tomorrow seminar in a wonderful blue-beautiful mine, which splendid the last heavy games with its last few days.
Sofia arrived in a diamond population.
This is the last event of a delegation in which Sofia is represented before birth.
His calculated time will be in September.
Sofia had chosen a beautiful pasteurised measuring metaphor.
The supremacy of the supreme was the high rate of compensation and the elegant sleep.
Mr Pasteinsi has splendid photographs.
Sofia has been on the Swedish delegation mission this week in Borstad.
Sofia was supplemented by a small boat.
Sofia was actually irradiated in its summer records.
Sofia was in the process of even hanging over photographs.
Now, I only wonder, Sofia said a laughter and referred to his final pregnancy.
He is raising us with a taste.
In the summer of 1996, a dog appeared on the brink in which sanitary food was sold.
The people of Laos did not dare to land, they had the courage to walk.
In cook, food was sold between Panya Suamsina and Panja.
He did not have much Finnish, and the Finns did not manage to do so at that time.
Since it did not dare to eat, Panja offered free-minded sectarian.
In this way, they learnt to eat thairay, Spring.
From countries, he said.
I left a piece of work.
I visited more and more, in the end, every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panama opened the ferry in its Cairns trade.
There were two small forums, fewer than 20.
He taught us not only to eat the Cairo, but also to sit next to the boat.
When hunger and places are restricted, we cannot leave the wind behind ourselves.
We have become more familiar with little time and we have become companions.
Finally, I was sitting on Saturday with the text in order to learn at the end of the day.
Two years went on the trading side, but then the restaurant had to be changed because the taste that was made would be too much in control.
A new place was freed from the rule.
There is room.
Now, we clubs are again able to sit on our own tables, only at the most congested times, to ask the visitors whether there is room.
Mr Panja knows his client.
He is informed of what has happened and who has been seen.
He knows what each eat.
He has seen variations in customer life and changes in the food career.
He will remember which man I visited to eat my first spring.
He remember me as a sledgehammer and a fever, and remember what I was.
It is hard to go to lunch a little later than others to sit on my own doorstep and exchange their views with those of Panama.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has learnt tolerance and internationalism.
He has opened not only our taste but also our thoughts and hearts.
There are many who speak to him today - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Mr Panta.
Although it has been difficult, he is always friendly.
He is diligent.
He is at the forefront of the peace work.
Last week, a restaurant celebrated the two decades.
We clients were given a diamond club.
Without any need or attention, this important day took place.
The discovery of 173 Igueri terrorists who were prepared to increase in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list of work in the fight against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 information from the Iguerrillas who are prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each individual.
Over 130 are Iraqi, but six Europeans are involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Iltas told the list and a few weeks ago.
Now I have a list and the information it contains is more precise.
According to the press, the special forces of the Iraqi army found a list of terrorists' personal data and pictures when they examined the continental base of the terrorist organisation in Moscow.
The American intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to the Internet.
It was distributed by Interpol to all the security authorities in European countries in May.
The underlying fear was that a large and serious act of terrorism in the West would be planned after the collapse of Ir in the neighbouring East.
According to Mr Welt, not only are the names and images of all people on the list, but also the birthday, invented under-conditions and information on the country of origin of the person.
The list also specifies the specific sectors of terrorists.
For example, Sami J., a German pensioner, who is on the list, reads the battle at Abu Assid Ali, that is, German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, first in Egypt, then in Libya and then through Turkey, in order to join the Iji rivers.
Suicide bombers have been written next to her.
The fate of the man is not more precise.
Europe has gone to the Irishi riots together to some 6 000 fighters whose fate is uncertain.
The man fell under the carpet in Helsinki
On the basis of the interview of the rescue company, the man wanted to show that he was tired.
It can save the spirit of the motion.
On Thursday, a person under the carpet of Helsinki was saved.
According to Mr Valle Estonia, who updates the Helsinki Civil Protection Institute, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found from the water for about 15 minutes after the announcement.
He was swayed by the salvage company, the Estonian says.
It received half a four-hour notice this afternoon.
The person was sent to the hands of first care.
Esder says that he was about fifty-year old man.
On the basis of the interviews, the man wanted to show that he was tired.
The situation in the Tokyo coast is already over.
The Esder applauds the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guards and the police.
It was a task led by the Corps of Border Guards.
The winners also learnt very well.
It was over 15 minutes.
The man was saved from water together with the Corps of Border Guards and the police.
Two cars were hit in Eura - nine people, three people seriously injured.
There were nine people in cars, the rest of which caused less injuries, and a day-to-day fire.
Among the injured are men and women.
This accident took place at three days.
Mr Kolari was when another car turned into a warehouse to another car.
According to the rescue plant, the risk area has a limit of 80 km per hour.
Debt is fighting for property of more than USD 500 million
Two brothers dispute the most important property empire in Victoria, which is worth more than USD 500 million, which is linked to their Italian salt 40 years ago to set up a family company.
The former chairman of the Carlton football club and the estate developer, Colin De Lutis, are only living in Total in the value of three winds from his younger brother, Mrs Paulsen, a younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court for the sharing of property between brother and business.
Mr Paul has wanted to leave the family company as early as 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
Debts and their mother Anna together owns 38 property worth more than half a billion, starting to collect property when they bought trade in Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans trade there, which was extended to a chain of 160 movements.
The Caucasus package was sold by USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on buildings and today the family owns offices, building areas in Brunsick and Sorrent and housing in Gold Coaste and Mt Buller and shopping centres.
According to the last agreement with the father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company and Paul about a third of its assets.
According to the legal documents, the distribution of property means that Colin owns to the value of some USD 316 million and Paul about USD 176 million.
Mr Paul is not satisfied with the allocation of property and money.
'I believe that, in his proposal, Mr Colin left the best buildings for himself ', Mr Paul wrote in his first lie certificate to the law by 2015.
Last Friday, this case was first dealt with at the Supreme Court after a number of conciliation undertakings.
The debts are also now arguing about who dominates the existing business, and Paul claims that he has been excluded from the business.
According to Mr Colin, this claim is not true; he accuses Paul of poor management of some of the buildings.
Colin writes one of his first photographs that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," as Colin says in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of opinions, e-mails and reports.
Allow Mr De Lulling and his late husband Luigi to be Italian immigrants who set up land branches and clubs at the end of the 1950s.
They were used as an insurance to buy from Collingwood the building on which Colin established the first flu trade in the family.
Colin tells us that he was founded on trade in the last few years, when Paul was still a child (about ten years old).
Allow Mr De Lulling to tell us that he and Mrs Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer buildings to their boards.
'Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court ', Anna writes in his statement.
The other two fathers of the family, Mr Mark and Mr Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lulling group, which according to Mr Colin, has received USD 10 million and Luke 26 million while leaving the company.
According to Mrs Paulsen, Luke and Mark are 'bitter sources of economic conditions'.
Colin has kept a low profile, even though it is a former member of the Australian Government and a television star at Eddie McGuiren's best friend in this life which appeared this year 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Coland Paul De Lutte and their lawyer on Friday.
Only Colin replied; he said in his textile message that it was not really possible to comment because it is being dealt with by the courts.
'It is very sad that my colleague, Mr Paul, has decided to take me to court and withdraw the name of our family to justice ', he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the courts that he had tried to agree to the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have liked us to be confronted in this way", followed by Colin and said that he still hopes that a solution can be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have exhausted.
'We shall be resolved in the near future ', as Colin wrote.
Mr Trumpi 's new chief accountant is going to restrict the use of the President' s media.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will at last succeed.
First.
According to the newspaper Polticoo, the new chief accountant of the White House intends to restrict the use of President Trumpi 's media and the monitoring of news, so that the bombing does not often get into difficulties.
The journalist, Josh Dawsey, reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff in the White House, met with the management staff at his first working day, he raised a key problem that he intends to resolve: He intends to restrict the availability of information to President Donald Trumper.
Mr Kelly told the White House that all the information - both printed and heard at media conferences - must go through him because he makes better decisions when he receives good information. "
Mr Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to restrict the use of the Trumpi media and their failure.
President Trumpi has a relationship with television for decades, and he still looks at television a great deal.
"If the candidate, Mr Trump, was nervous by the unfair news, he was well advised to show that the sympathetic media had a more balanced approach to the matter", the adviser who worked in the Trumpi campaign, Sam Nunberg, told the Politicoo newspaper in February.
Mr Tara Palmeri, the journalist of Politico, wrote at the time that 'it is essential for him to have a balanced flow of photographs under control of the use of Mr Trumpi Twitter'.
Clearly.
But it is ridiculous to say that Trumph Twitter would ever have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know what we do not know - perhaps the Trumper would have done without their efforts even more.
We will probably never know what messages were not sent from Trum.
If his staff have been able to prevent him at least a few times, their work will not have been in vain.
No one, however, has been consistently able to prevent the heights caused by more Trugs.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House that are trying to drive their case forward by providing Trumpi with information which supports their view, which can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the President questionable information.
The journalist, Shane Goldmacher, mentioned a case:
'The present and former workers say that they can love a huge amount of money from the press in which they are criticised - especially if they are told about harmful information leaks - and then they will be forced to know where they come from.
At the end of February, when someone gave the President a copy of the news of the GotNews.Comme site, which was set up by Johnson, which accused the Deputy Director-General of Katie Walshia of several leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter and had previously spread false accusations and then withdrawn, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Mr Trump had begun to look at the staff from Wales. "
Goldmacher added that the then head of staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary of State of the White House, Mr Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a system for managing documents to go to Trumper. "
And what was the outcome?
If you do not try to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Mr Trump still has his own glimpse of himself and his assistants.
These unchanged facts make the task of Kelly extremely difficult.
Neymar-Gill Agreement of five years
Brazil star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSGP.
It was reported earlier on Thursday evening that the representatives of Neymar had paid a football price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelon in the Spanish flag.
The Neymar Agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dismantled and he was free to move to the PSGP.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was in Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogbisa in France.
PSGP owns the government to Qatar Sports Inwaterways.
As President of the Council, I am following the former tenderer, the Cape-Khelaifi.
Mr Neymar is supposed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The writer Rail Oranen explained alcoholism and air fear on the shelf: 'I am in order for my life'.
The well-known successful author, Raijan Oranen, spent just 69th anniversary.
He helped Rail Organia.
Five children, in addition to writing, see mutilation, that Rail and his husband Jyrski abandoned Spain 's sunshine and Fuengiroa' s home after 18 winter.
First of all, they sold their house, but now, in spring, they also left the temporary housing.
Light and solar, out of the old Olympic Games in Raijan at the time, the depression and alcohol he has encountered.
External action is also less than 20 kilos.
The pressure went on to fall when the Services were closed, they were the motives.
I was given help in alcohol at the time from shells, which was also a test of air fear.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, a purifying writer says openly.
Rail and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same journey for over 45 years.
I can better than ever.
Mr Oranen, who also worked in the field of Rail and tourism, has been working together for more than 40 years.
I walked up, and that was married for two weeks, Raijan.
The Queen of such a drama has always been, he stopped his life from that, Jyrki laugh.
Mr Oranen has made a great writer 's career just remember a good four-part glass tosax, which was affected and moved by the statutory time in Finland.
Once and for all, I decided to open the door to the clothing industry, when I read Liisa Seppänen's five-year interview on the plane.
I myself was a tyrant, my mother also had a clothing movement and I sometimes act as a diamond, Mr Oranen's memory.
He changed the attitude of the Finnish people to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savel's research and argument reveal it, Oranen says.
Raijan Oranen lives as an author of active time, has many hands - hundreds of ideas.
They returned to the brink of 'millionaires'.
The most wealthiest farmers in the West Midlands are once again on the line with the stubbornnnnnnnness rooms who managed to cross the season and return to the beauty of houses.
The Kerians stopped a couple of people from aspiring to a what is known as the 'near Solkul'.
They were driven out of the region in May, but they succeeded in overcoming the much-needed power, including children, horses and the army of package cars.
They succeeded in crossing a point which had not been protected by incineration.
The ravaged people have accused the municipality of Mr Solana of being 'absolutely incapable of solving the problem'.
An anonymous resident tells us that the rotating people were on Monday evening of Bentley Heath, where they had thrown windows in stone.
'The nation must be hard hit because it seems to be totally incapable of resolving the problem.
They were here in May, then they left but they returned.
They became more and probably more today this evening. "
He said that the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
'I live in Streetbrook Road and it is frustrating to pay local tax when the municipal tax is incapable of doing anything about it '.
It is ridiculous for the second anonymous person to return so soon after they were driven out.
'There are more than ever and they have even counted the horse. '
According to Mr Solana's information, the municipality is aware of illegal camps around Streetbrook Roadi.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many local as possible make police reports about disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
The ravaged people were surrounded by the Portuguese security machine.
In Portugal, men who were full of people on the coast have been consulted in court today.
Yesterday, two people died as a result of a patent.
Two men flying the plane can be prosecuted for the death penalty.
In Portugal, 16 years of imprisonment would be far from possible.
Yesterday, men had to fly on the beaches of Sao Joao da Caparica.
At an event, there were hundreds of people on the beaches, some of whom are landing in the water.
The plane went into a man of 560s and an eight-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first came to the man who was in a clear machine.
Immediately afterwards, the plane rose upwards and once it fell, it came to the end of the child, told the Filipe Janeira de Noticias.
The daughter who died was on the beaches with his parents.
Girls' parents were not injured.
On the beaches they were angry immediately after the security.
The girl and other people went to the machine and started to look for their family, reported the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the flying criminal, he was desperate.
It is miracle that more people have not died.
Two men in the machinery were not injured.
"Without accident, the Finnish pedestrian station, which had been tragically lost, would once again win MMM."
On Wednesday morning, the Matti-The Hamari celebrated Finland during the Competition in Big Whitehead.
In the past, the Great Lakes also won the Cros MM gold.
All in all, MMMs have already collected three.
Quite incredible MMMs!
On two occasions, the journey, the good tip, the Suri Hamari, which was won by the telephone.
The children of 30 years of age applauded their whistle-blowers and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamas, the number of interlocutors in species is increasing all the time.
The whole of the Maghreb has grown and has evolved a great deal recently.
The differences are decreasing and there are many new children involved.
One always wonders whether there will be a black horse.
There seems to be a different winner in the cat.
- The Great Hamari lost his second pedestrian in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from the young to his friends and did not want to get on with it.
I would like to point out from time to time that what life would be without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in getting bogged down.
They play the game of what has been distributed, and the Great Hamari emphasis.
It would be cruel to support a serious accident and a loss of time in the lurch, and it would not be the case that the Greater Hamas.
But he turned into a terrible difficulty.
I would say that the situation turned out to be a victory.
I would not be a three-fold World Cup without accident.
In the run-up to the accident, the main slogan of the Suremand Hamar was already slowing down.
It was only after the accident that my new colleague started.
As a young man, I was with the yards and we always saw X@-@ Games in our enthusiasm.
But they were distant dreams, which went some way in the long term.
After the accident, I found myself in something of the Xth Games store.
I would not have imagined in advance.
I was 23. I thought that this really will be a long life if I am here to break and mourn.
I decided to withdraw the havens and start work.
I would say that I have been quite successful.
It was with great pleasure that the wheelchair, Lok Peter, was selected as a year sportsman.
A four-fold Olympic opponent received his prize in the sporting Gulf in January.
According to the Great Hamas, profit is an important signal to the sporting community.
It was a big business, and the victory was absolutely earned.
This will certainly also open our eyes to the sporting world.
When is it time to launch a two-year sports campaign by the World Cup, the Matti-The Hague?
That will be seen in due course.
I will try to do my best to succeed.
As yet, the Great Hamari has not conquered all the energy that it has been so passionate.
Next year we will have a major objective.
In a year 's time, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
Yes, we are starting to apply for a mentality!
The majority of refugees in Syria do not believe that they will return permanently to their country unless the war is ended and Isis source.
A Voice for Youngh Syrian Refugees study explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are fleeing in the refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return permanently to their country of origin.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Iji are the most important things that should happen to enable them to return to their country of origin.
The Trumper regime does not see any change to the Syrian conflict.
The corridor Buronzon-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
In nine years' time, Buronista Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of the Arab people.
This year, the AVoice for Youngh Syrian Refugees study explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
In March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrian young people between 18 and 24 were responsible for research, half of them women and men.
Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin in the future.
42% of the defendants can think of returning to their country of origin and 4% could not be said.
According to this study, the decision on the return of young people will be most affected by the war in Syria and by the presence of Iji in that country.
Almost half (47%) considers the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the repatriation of the country, while a quarter believes that the most important thing is to leave Iji.
Only less than 10% will make the most important factors for the decision to improve the economic situation or leave Bashar Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
The young Syrian people were asked what the most important factor is for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar Assad.
A quarter of the President of Assad is considered to be a barrier to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that political and military solutions are needed in order to put an end to the current conflict in Syria.
The resolution of the conflict by means of military measures alone is only fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see the regime weakened in the last year, while the fifth experience is that it has been strengthened.
According to the opponents, the most important thing in the fight against Islam is that the media should inform people that Islam has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many have given priority to military measures and education reform.
It is fair to say that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
In the wake of the Trumpi regime's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of the opponents believe that the conflict will not change under the Trumpi regime.
Almost every four people believe that the Syrian conflict will deteriorate during the Trumpi era.
Opinions are divided over whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Mont Widenius spend half of his time in order to keep the net in order - his knowledge database, for example, uses Wikipet and Google.
MariaDB develops the 'fastest growing' database of origin in the world.
Michael 'Mont' The main product of MariaDB, which was set up by Widenius, does not cost users anything and can be developed via NET by anyone.
For example, Google and Wikh are the users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily the paying clients.
The databases will allow huge numbers of information to remain in order and available quickly.
If you use Linkekeys, Twitter or Booking.comia, for example, you use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
'All information, which is not in the form of description, comes from the database, and the pictures have been made there ', explains Widenius.
Mr Widenius, the technological director of MariaDB, spend about half of his time at home.
A man who works from the bottom of the world will help to ensure that the Internet works in a merger way.
Widenius developed the most popular open source database in the world, together with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technological company Sun MySQL amounted to USD 1 billion and, a year later, software left off with 7.4 billion.
When the Orace trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers declared themselves to be leaving.
'they did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a clear promise of the future of MySQL ',' Widenius will remember.
He had already set up a company which started to develop MariaDB.
He did not want to die.
I have returned from Sun to the best development and thereby ensured that the test is maintained with the same yardsticks that it was created.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name had to be changed.
The freedom to control the development of the MariaDB code was created.
'MySQL did not make these assurances', Widenius is a pity.
While many people have heard about Widlands and MySQL's billions, few Finnish people know anything about MariaDB.
'For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year ', it says the leader of MariaDB, Kith Paq.
MariaDB, which is concentrating on growth, does not make a profit yet, and Mr Pacq is a meagre company.
He reveals that, during the current dirty period, MariaDB estimates to be able to obtain opportunities of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it which business customers are prepared to pay.
MariaDB will also help to exchange databases, which may be more than a year 's career if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL will be able to move from MariaDB at an early stage because they are different versions.
One of the Spanish operators, Telefónica, and the largest Asian bank in Kaakhstan, is DBS.
The most popular pilot services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Coffd, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in the distribution packages of Linux, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small fira, we have connections with the major players.
'The world's largest telecoms operators, toilers, banks and even a few central banks', the Pakavalé list.
Giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP still exist.
Oraclelle MySQL is modest in comparison with the traditional closed database of the company.
Even though, according to Mr Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their share of the market in recent years, there are still few, albeit rapidly growing, accidents such as MariaDB in turnover.
Approximately USD 50 billion in the information market, the databases of an open source code are not even worth one billion.
The weight of the open source code cannot, however, be measured only in money, because the majority of users do not pay any for these programmes.
The research company, Mr Gartner, is predicting that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications for open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged or at least started.
Large companies will not get new customers, because the majority will choose the next open source code.
This has led to friction in the licence fees for commercial databases.
They want to do the same amount of money as they used to do in a smaller number of customers', Widenius is thinking.
Since the exchange of closed databases is cumbersome, the majority of customer companies have bought up a heated price.
'It is a great many customers for whom it is extremely difficult to move because their old applications and others are caught in a closed database ', Widenius says.
He believes, however, that the clients are about to become full.
As licence fees increase every year, customers will sooner or later move on to an open source database.
The price is between 10% and 20% of the past, and the service is better, because the customer can easily exchange information if he so wishes.
Moreover, many companies are facing major changes to the system in transferring their activities to pilot services.
At the same time, many people change information software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank.
It was the largest growth fund granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
A company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now going to recruit more.
One reason for funding the EIB was the impact of Mariatics on public procurement.
It has public sector clients, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move towards open source solutions, thus using tax money more effectively", as Mr Paq says.
It is regrettable from Widenia how money is being wasted in Finland, for example in closed health systems, when open systems are cheaper and the owner is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source method is ideology, but I think it is a better way of doing it.
The Community is helping and doing something that is neither feasible nor capable of doing.
As well as the 5th-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source-source promoters of the other Finnish, Linux developed.
Widenius will help other companies to develop viable business models in the open source.
I still have between 4 and 5 speeches every year in all parts of the world on this subject.
Italy is boosting its attitude to civil protection vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations which save refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they must not continue unless they commit themselves to complying with the new rules.
"If non-governmental organisations do not commit themselves to a new policy guideline, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate", the Minister for the Interior, Marco Minniti, said in an interview with the Technical La Stampa newspaper.
This warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized the German Jugend Red Cross, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with smugglers of human beings, which contributed to illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the Assistance Organisation refused to comment on the detailed accusations of Ambrogio Cartou.
'We save human lives is, and will be, the most important, and we very much regret that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area ', an organisation announced in its statement in the social media.
'We will only be able to judge the accusations once we have gathered all the information needed and we will be able to assess the situation '.
Since the beginning of October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Red.
Crews are suspected of taking boats gradually from traffickers in human beings who were re-used.
One such case is alleged to have happened only a few kilometres away from the Libya coast.
The crew is suspected of sacrificing the Italian Coastguard, which monitors the rescue operations in the region.
According to the guideline, vessels such as Iuventa should be involved in an Italian police force to monitor the activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the guideline: Pelastarian Lapset and Maltese MOAS, as well as the Spanish Professor Open Arms;
On Thursday, anyone who declared that the new rules would be superfluous but acceptable because they do not cause 'major changes or obstacles' to the rescue activities of the organisation.
Among those who refuse to comply with the guideline are the 'Nobel Prize for Médecins without frontiers'.
In turn, Mr Minni said that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy has fallen dramatically over the last few weeks, as he sees it as a sign that the measures to strengthen the Coastguard in Libya and that cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
'The lie at the end of the tunnel 'has started in recent days, as the Minister said.
He revealed that the plans are to continue to discuss economic development projects this month with the mayors of Libya, as well as with Chad, Nigeria and Malta, measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
The defendant is suspected of killing his unmarried partner, Enron, the suspected was found in the country - the prosecutor.
The suspected offence took place at the time of Enron in Kursk last December.
According to the police, a man of the age of 360s is suspected of killing his Scottish unmarried partner.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspects would have fled with two dogs in the country.
The man was found in a sown country and he did not resist when he was stuck.
It is necessary to raise the blame within less than a week.
The case may be raised in Lapland's secondary law until August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Pottert and all my esteemed friends, has died.
The Brittar Robert Hardy has died at 9 years old.
On Thursday, this family was informed of the death of the actor.
Hardy, which was born in 1925, started his actor in a theatre of 24 years old.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and television.
Mrs Hardy is particularly recalled about the role played by Mr Cornelius Toffe in Harry Pottert and the role of veterinary surgeons in the TV register based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC has been described in a total of seven months.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for textiles provoked by suicide.
A Massachussian woman has been sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for textiles and phones considered to incite his son friend, Conrad Roy, to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years in a conditional prison.
Mr Carter was sentenced to e-mail in June, and his son, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
'For my family has been murdered ', the father of Conrad said at the sitting on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter sought a change in the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened with 20 years' judgment, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Mr Carter, who has fallen into Red Houghts and the heighteness, listened to his sentence in the face of a faithful view of the country.
'The prosecutor killed Conrad Roy '.
'he chose Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility ', the prosecutor continued.
'he has shown no discovery '.
According to Mrs Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by 'appalling circumstances which Carter is deeply affected'.
However, the judge, Lawrence Moniz, was of the opinion that the Carter 's' age or village ', or even the problem of mental health, had a significant impact on his actions'.
The prosecutor read the statement by Mrs Lynn Roy, the mother of Conrad, who said that she was not going for a day to die.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I can cope with all this, and I will try to give him my best confidence in the pain that we always face. "
Conrad's guerriar Camdy Roy told the right that he was' persecuted 'that he never came to see his brother's plight and was never going to be his children.
'It is a painful man who has been in my life every day since I was born. '
This seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusts which states that inciting suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 1714 years old when Rome was found dead in 2014.
This incident attracted attention from the local authorities when it became clear that, in his textile messages, Mr Carter had encouraged his son to commit suicide.
"I do not know how many things are", Carter wrote in many of the messages he sent to Rome over the past two weeks, when Rome was on holiday with his family.
Just before Roy suicide, Mr Carter wrote: 'You must do it, Conrad' and 'Sinth must only start a Generator, and you are free and happy'.
The judge, Mr Monti, said that Carter sought attention on the death of Roy, which stipulated that Carter must not benefit by carrying out interviews.
This case has divided the opinions of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter; one defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, which was convicted of the murder of his British bad colleague in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the opinion polls of Knox, in which he says' Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison '.
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia since the worst of the Cold War
The military alliance between??????????????????????? On Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in his interview with the CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Krimin, in 2014 and the continuing instability in the Russian-Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tension does not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from escalating and the new Cold War.
Before Mr Stotenberg's comments, the American President, Donald Trump, had the time to say that he had even reached a dangerous level between the USA and Russia.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the bad-coloured Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines because of the setback suffered by car manufacturers.
A day before the announcement by Audis, the BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The leader of BMWs said that he believes that 'it is more sensible than driving restrictions', which he referred to European cities, including the town of BMWen, in Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Mrs Daimler announced that it will make changes to engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a call back.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States has been heavily marketed by European car manufacturers in order to achieve the CO2 emission targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and asthma.
The cost of stockpiling equipment will increase and it will be difficult to charge cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored and Chancellor Angela Merree has been accused of the goodwill of large car companies and of ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used to be fitted in Volkswagen's cars, which reduced emissions to tests according to the regulations.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of the leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are being examined.
Last month, the former director of the Audi motor development department was arrested in Germany.
Zackheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was invoked for a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which doubted that Audi had adopted a system which could circumvent Europe's emission requirements, based on a similar study in the United States.
The Volkswagen study could significantly weaken the position of Volkswagen: The car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
The vote in Venezuela began with lively, large demonstrations.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from Firman, who has no role to play in the election result, the chairman of the National Election Commission, Mrs Lucas, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end.
In a controversial vote on Sunday, Venezuela was elected by a representative to amend the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against changing it.
The opposition to Maduroa has postponed its own demonstrations so that they can take place at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais, the national security forces started on Wednesday evening at local level to take over the country's parliament building.
The forces are meant to ensure that the opportunity to appoint is safe.
Climate change poses a threat to the Provence ladder.
Laos has become the symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but it is now threatening climate change.
Laveni had fallen due to drought and the attacks on disease, and scientists and farmers are trying to find a solution.
'Lavent is actually endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked reduction in the rainfall in the spring, and especially in the autumn, 'says that the CREPAMD research expert in Provence, Eric Chaiscit.
"This reduces the life of the boat.
Furthermore, the drought has brought many small plants into the region which spread microbacteria. "
The stakes are high.
Lavenilian oil attracts tourists, and it is also a very well-intentioned component of volatile water and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have fewer flowers that are poorly developed or lacking", as Chaisse says.
"In other words, there is less and less oil-rich parts."
A solution is sought by stepping up irrigation, by slowing down soil reprisals and by slowing down the water mixtures by protecting plants and by developing more sustainable varieties of drought.
The murder of journalists in Mexico is a growing threat.
The transmission of a daily Riodoeu newspaper usually meets on Wednesday to discuss the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug in the state of Sinaloan.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routine.
Two well-known journalists are talking about which is safer: To leave children home or to involve them in the delivery that took place in 2009.
The safety experts have written three words to the table, which is in the worst interests: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They are asking for names from journalists in each group.
The table will be written on the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being subordinate to the government or to drugs cartels, who are criminals who make the chaos in Mexico a breath of news.
This violence is unleashed and, increasingly, attacks are aimed at journalists; according to the journalists' Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Carden, the founder of Riodock, the journalist and inspiration.
'The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be the journalist ', Mr Valdez wrote together in several of his books on drug violence.
He is being called on to do so, even though he is present everywhere, and the trademark of the Riodock building conceals a huge picture in which Mr Valdez appears to be concentric slamea: 'Justice'.
This meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Mr Valdez, journalists will discuss their common strategy, their nightmare, their dream and their anxiety as persecution.
A federal public prosecutor was set up in 2010, especially for the handling of journalists, but so far, according to the Conservation Committee, only two charges have been brought.
Very rarely do journalists have to go to court, as are the thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year.
Riodock journalists will continue to write about the violence in Sinala, even though they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the Security Council will be of little use because the killers are not known and are not hoping for justice.
'This meeting is quite frankly a waste of time '.
'We cannot trust anyone as long as we do not know the cause '.
Mr Valdez had left the delivery of Riodock in the capital of the state in Culiacanan this morning, 15.5.2017.
He had saved his Riodoon with just a couple of cards when he was stopped by two men and forced out of his car and shot out of twelve ferries, presumably linked to the name of the press: Riodoe means twelve rivers.
The shells were driven out by the car of Valdez and bought it at some distance.
Mr Valdez was fifty years old.
He left his wife and two-fold children.
Rumours move quickly and saved freely in Culiacanan.
The death of Mr Valdez is, however, a matter of urgency.
Sinala has been one of Mexico's most bloody battles since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill the vacuum.
On the streets of Sinena, someone or several people are shot into death on a daily basis, and the funeral has substituted two-tier funeral burial buildings of drugs couples, which are larger than many households.
The state on the coast has' peace 'when only one cartel dominates the ports and the routes of drug trafficking in the United States.
Even though Mr Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodock, the 60th-year-old Imail Bojorquez feels guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors led to the assassination of Valdez.
In February, Riodock published the interview between Damaso Lutz, a rival group which is waging war on Guzman's son.
It may have angered the boys of Guzman: The clients suspected of being members of the English newspaper bought every newspaper as soon as the newspaper came into the sales points.
The second error was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same home was attacked.
Valdez was a legenda in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had shown so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste, when he decided to set up with five colleagues in 2003 in Riodock, when shares in the press were sold on USD 50.
In Sinala, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drugs problem, Mr Bojorquez says.
Time and time, the cows started to feel their courageous and honest districts and their sale and advertising income increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing a hard-class journalism without fear, and readers stoned the doors of the press which nobody else had the courage to publish.
Eight years after Riodock won the respected Maria Moors Cabith prize in Latin America.
In the same year, Mr Valdez was awarded the International Liberation Committee's Prize for the Freedom of the Press, for having had the courage to follow the story of the drug trafficking in Mexico unheeded.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
'I want to continue to live ', as he said when he received the prize of the journalist Committee.
Drug trafficking is a 'way of life' in Sinala, Mr Valdez said that Rompean exports during the TV interview last October.
'The journalist must take on his assignment - or play a fool.
I do not want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown - why did I not tell me what was going on? '
Mr Valdez, the staff of Riodock, needs a scourge like a dock worker, a friend who always received cheap advice and a teacher who knows how to survive.
They put him in his pockets.
He always used an amateur.
He was at El Guayabo and always sitting at the same table.
They are now asking whether the routine would be to his fate.
The death of my colleague has also led them to reflect on how best to do their job and keep alive.
'The criminals do not like this if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret branches of the drugs trade.
They were left out ', Mr Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-regulation and self-protection;
Confidence in its own clothes.
If it feels that everything is not right, we must remain absent.
The problem is, according to Riodock's journalist, Mrs Andres Villiarreal, that 'the impression can be deceived, and that is what happened in the Jajaer case'.
Old rules no longer apply in Sinland, nor do they apply to Tamauliar, Veracruz, Guerrero and other Länder, where there are dangerous networks: Attractive smugglers, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The working environment is constantly changing.
A few days ago, it became clear that only activists and journalists had been watched by the Riodock security education programme.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought to protect themselves against 40%.
They had been ordered by the government of the Länder to control the Riodock passports in the four-class building in the Culiacan region.
Some journalists thought that they had halved whether these two police officers were among the 50% which the Governor of the Länder did not consider reliable.
It has been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside under drugs control.
This week, Mr Riodock 's delivery was scheduled for three headings.
The brother of the Nyrinth Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinala.
It was also intended to reveal that government spending had focused on the town of Governor.
In addition, one of the most expensive food supplements in Culiacan, and I only picked up the public prosecutor's office, was the tortured group.
There was no official information, who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: Everyone in the city knew that food supplements were in favour of drug dealers and authorities.
A journalist found out in public documents that a restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (Pri), who has managed Mexican policy at all levels at almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases that are widely publicised.
Mr Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which 'El Caco' Guzman's boys managed to escape and avoid an army ravage.
A few months earlier, the readers would have known that they had reliable information about the abduction of the Valdez Column.
'Flaco 'would have known what had happened in the past.
"Now all links with our sources of information are different."
The Valdez working machine has been turned into stockpile, preserving signs and stories against the persecution of journalists, with a new, unexpected task: They have become activists for press freedom.
The journalist, Miliam Ramirez, took note of a few villages when he left the next morning with a demonstration from the local Public Prosecutor 's office, which was responsible for another murder of journalists.
Salvador Adaus disappeared three days after the assassination of Mr Valdez.
After the disappearance, a incinerated body was found which, on the basis of the authorities' DNAs tests, is Asia.
Journalists have begun to protest more vigorously throughout the country.
Today, Mr Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for investigating the Valdez case.
On the day after the Valdez assassination, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinaloan and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has then asked for him to be taken away from the government because he is concerned that he will not be able to be objective.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, by the authorities and by an indifferent society.
In its last letter, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drugs gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
'Mexico is silent by killing people ', Mr Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralysing effect.
No one forgotten the death of Mr Elizabeth Macias in the north of the border state of Tamauliar six years ago.
His body was the message signed by the Zetasht cartel: "I am here for the sake of my writing."
He was cut off with a computer plate and a butcher.
Some newspapers have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of the border state of Chihuahua following the March assassination of Miroslava Breach.
Some will continue to do so, as did El Manana, the leader of Nuevo Laredo, who was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarz published a message on his front page to the drugs cartels: 'What do you want?'
Some journalists have fled from their Länder or the country as a whole.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and we must be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals look to journalists, as evidently happened with the photographer Rwanben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women at the housing in Mexico City in 2015, three months after he had fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Mr Ibarra - who had to become a poet at the time - admits that it is feared to write about drug trafficking.
'I was a journalist because Mexico is on his way to hell '.
A few days ago, Riodock journalists sit on the anti-personnel beer when the new number of the press had been finalised.
In an ammunition between the competing companions and the security forces, 19 people died on the beaches of Mazatland.
The war was heated, as promised in the messages from the map found in the region.
Journalists put news on the Riodock website in their intelligence phones.
The next day, the Estuary had to be put off.
The Sireence expires - another amputation.
Mr Bojorquez lived up with the policemen who are watching the delivery:
If they were afraid, they concealed it very well.
Mr Riodock 's mission continued the tradition of the murdered founding father of the press by the massive formulation in which the man seems to be concentrated on the whole of Sinala.
Mr Bojorquez says that it is not even possible to consider putting an end to this action, "how can I suspend the press when our practitioners asked to get to the streets on the same day as Javier Solana was murdered?"
Hannu Manna Olympic project began with a huge setback - 'The seat'.
In April, the celebrations of Hannu Manna, who has been up for 39 years, remained short, since the profession began to prepare for the Olympic Games.
However, the river period began in a disastrous way when the Manna became ill in its flu.
It started a long period of illness, which was reduced to almost five weeks.
In May, practically all of them went ill.
First there was the flu disease, and finally there was the child's disease, such as the replacement that I had to eat with antibiotics.
I was in a position to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I do not remember when I have been stones for about a long time.
It was a hard place when I was unable to take advantage of training, Mannan tells Ilyan.
Theatre out of office
The World Cup in 2007 only received a licence for training in the second week of June, which was reflected in the Institute for Sports and Exports on 12 June at the KIHU's prayer tour.
In the theatre, the sportsman sportsmen and women sleep on a land whose speed is growing every three minutes.
After every three reports, the journey comes to something like ten seconds and the test is being oppressed by sportsmen and women with milk acidification.
Last autumn, I took 32 minutes, but now I remained for 28 minutes.
Mr Manna says.
For the better.
After the initial difficulties, Manna says that he has remained healthy.
I have carried out a wide range of peaceful aerial exercises which I have tried to normalise the physical exchange of organs.
It is now a really good five-week period.
One and a half weeks ago, there was a holiday of flight homework.
I was also able to visit my family.
During the last period, the continent only participated in the competition of four World Cup before the Gulf Mountains.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manna increased at the top of 18.
Guidelines
Petter Kukonen has made a training and competition plan up to February next year.
We are now looking for a different rhythm over the last few months.
After the Enlargement, Rwanda would be at the weekend of three World Cup.
In December, at least one of the weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramallah.
At the end of January, the plans should be included in Seefle.
I hope that the name will then be found on the list of the Olympic Games, as Mr Mannan says.
The Olympic Games in Pyeongchang would be the sixth winter Olympic Games in continental life.
The most important thing now is to remain healthy, Salt Lake City 2002 is to carry out a numbered slogan in team competition.
Dinosai was protected by disguised enemies.
First of all, it appears to be frightening.
Today, scientists have revealed the first results of the study by Canadian mining workers on the basis of an essential role which was so well maintained that experts would call it Mona.
It was so well maintained that researchers were even able to define that its nice skin was red and had a problem with the past.
According to the Current Biology, it has always survived the most tanks and representatives of its best species in the world.
A recent fossil is a nodose which, at the central stage of the annex, was reached between 1100m and 112 million years ago.
Researchers see this extremely retained fossil as a very important piece of work.
According to the National Geograph, the varied herbicides in their species are best maintained by fossil.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium disaster in Canada, a mining man called Shawn Funk.
He went to something that seemed not to be a natural part of the earth and decided to look more closely at the discovery.
The flame retardant museum was sent from Kallit to the royal fire museum in Tyrrelli.
For six years, fraud was raised from 1100 kilograms of salmon.
The results of hard work are now on the way.
'if you cloud your eyes, you can almost believe that you were sleeping ', the scientist, Calb Brown, who is working as a scientist in the Kyrre Revolutionary Museum.
'There is one of the most beautiful and best maintained dinosities in the history of science.
Studies in NATO have shown that dinosities that eaten meat are likely to pose a major threat to this plant, even though it was a tank and it reminded us of the cash tanks.
It was disguised by its white tanks and protected from the headquarters by a more heat and more suffocated colour that still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better placed to confuse its environment with avoid its enemies, greater dinosities.
110 million old nowadays came under the headlines in May and it is now on the spot in the rebel museum in Tyrrel.
The scientists have given it a name from Borealia to Markmitchelli Mitchell, the museum Technical Technical Technical Technologist, who was part of the road that had taken up the dinosossus of more than 7 000 hours.
Nodossus has remained so astonishing that Mitchell and the International Scientific Task Force have been able to identify its poor dreams and their forms.
They found that it was still protected in the world by the general colour of the animal world, in which the poor is more heat and more elections.
It was, however, surprising because Boreper is much greater than the existing animals with similar colours.
It may come to the conclusion that dinoss eating meat penalised it to such an extent that the Evideo chose to survive as a means of survival rather than hiding behind the struggle.
The present animals, for example, have the same colour for peers, clubs and archaeans, which are significantly lower and therefore easier to catch, which indicates that those shares were also seriously threatened.
'The resignation of a high tank dinosaided dinosa tells us how dangerous the dinosai shares of the meat were ', Mr Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosossus reveals that its laughter was red.
Scientists will continue to study these skills in order to draw conclusions from their lives, including their content to find out what it was sleeping through its last meal.
Scientists believe that they lost their lives in a river and went to a sea where they sink into their seabed.
Alberta was as warm as it was today in Florida and rivers and seas probably went much further than they are today.
'This skills is extremely important, because its sweeping laugh has remained and has remained in its original three-fold form ', as Mr Brown says.
"That is why it seems almost the same as it was in the early accession period.
It does not require much imagination: If you put a little eye on it, you can almost believe that you were sleeping. "
The season was at the time of the theatre, of huge double-hulled dinosoes, of meat-eating dinosities.
Although their King, Tyrannosaux, that is to say millions of years of Boreper earlier, its powerful predecessors may have been able to catch up for this tanks of dinosai.
Tyrannosose's predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthorus, about 11.5 metres of long-fibre monster.
The most recent discoveries of researchers in Nodosequity have been published in the Current Biology, who believe that Borealia shouted after its death at sea and changed.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium disaster in Canada, a mining man called Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best maintained dinosaurs and tanks in the world from a baby.
On average, it was five metres long and highlighted as many as 1 300 kg.
They suffered two half-baked pieces.
Researchers believe that this tank carcinogens passed through the present West Canada until the river transported it to the open sea.
Its tanks have remained small in the sea.
Its fossil shells have remained so well that its laugh remains on the brink of bankruptcy.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geograph that such preservation is' as rare as a lottery victory.
The more astonishing it appears.
There is still a hole in its husbandry.
It is in its village, five secure upwards.
I will also be able to count on its landscape. "
How did a activist learn to answer the question: Who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked at 9.8.14.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier.
He then found the message from his reader:
'The police killed a young person just 18, and his bodies are still on the streets'.
With disgust, he noted that no one else had supplied the same information on his ethesis, which is why he closed Mr Faceboov and opened Mr Twitter.
There were a number of restaurants from the user, Mrs ALTheePharov.
The author belongs to St, and to a wheelchair in Louise who, in real time, swired on the death of Michael Brown, who had been shot by the white police in an unarmed 18th-year-old black Brown Ferguson Missguson.
The user had also sent a picture of the unlived bodies of Mr Brown on the streets, where it was left for four hours.
'that is incredible ', Mrs Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later this evening, he was told that people were collecting Canfield Drivi.
The users picked pictures of police stateless carcasses and people who were drugs, and the father of Brown, who said: "My unarmed son was killed by the Ferguson police force!"
Mrs Ferrell followed a veritable video, where the police stood before the demonstrators in front of the dog.
He also says that he has seen a video in which another police deployed his misuse and rumours: 'I shall kill all of you...'
"This is not normal", Mrs Ferrell will remember her words.
'This was not the kind of murder we have already experienced and could be called typical.
Then I knew the colours.
I was angry and I was. "
He stolen a return home for the next day.
Mrs Ferrell was able to go to her sixty-year-old daughter and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Mrs Ferrella and Mrs Fergusone over the next almost three years has been documented: 'Wose Street', which received its first appearance in cinemas 11.8.2017.
Cinema is an offer of survival and of demonstration, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Mrs Ferrell went towards Ferguson with her daughter and her daughter who has fallen into the crown, they have re-examined the debate on 'what is going to be black and under what conditions', which had spoken on countless occasions before that morning.
'That, when I told you how black people had to fight for what they believe? 'Mrs Ferrell will remember her words to her daughter.
'We are going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that is not right. '
'I could not resist my daughter ', Mrs Ferrell said later.
'The events of today are the culmination of the past.
My daughter has the right to know and grow.
He must be able to mobilise and organise, but he must also feel blackmailed by the various times and conditions of life, and he must know what we have to do to liberalise us.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as any other black girls.
It seems to me that I would damage him if I were to protect him from reality. "
The first station in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, who is against police status, who became the camp of activists when they were waiting for information on the handling of the case and finally found out that the police would not be prosecuted.
Mrs Ferrell and her daughter went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch bullets and distribute them to demonstrators.
Mrs Ferrell began to take a new approach to activists.
'St, at the University of Misouri, Mrs Ferrell was chairman of the organisation of medical students belonging to minorities, was completely changed after 9 August.
'I had no experience of organisation.
That happened. "
A few weeks later, Mrs Ferrell met the assistant at the demonstration this afternoon in Sabath Folayan.
Mr Folayan said that he and the description Mrs Lucas Alvarador wanted simply to say 'what was happening.
Mrs Ferretu was wondering: 'Do you really want to tell us what is happening or do you want a story that you can use?'
The countless times when people were appearing to the local community, the White Paper in general, who simply wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
'We heard that the birth and growth in Ferguso did not have a common voice ', Mr Folayan recently said in the interview:' We wanted to do things differently '.
Folayan had already contacted Damo David, known as his activist on the prisoners sentenced to death.
Mrs Ferreira 's presence led Mrs Ferreira to go along with six other local authorities and followed events in the years following the shooting of Mr Brown.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk" Mr Davis says.
'The most important thing for me is how local people are presented in films, because I am presented in the same way '.
According to Folayan, it was not the intention to concentrate on Mrs Ferreira's experience, because it was wanted to show that the popular movement is not a caricature but a community, but a community, but Mrs Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
That is why it is surprising to see the private side of Mrs Ferrella's life, such as love and navel.
'I felt quite naked ', Mrs Ferrell naïve, when she told us what it seemed to be for the first time.
"But I understand that this work and the human description of black people require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Mrs Ferrella 's story once and again brings the role of black women in the wider Black Lives movement.
The movement was born in the social media, after the police shot the black theatre Trayo Martin in 2012.
The leadership of black women has maintained the whole movement ', Mrs Ferrell says,' it is because we are constantly struggling on many fronts.
Black women have had to endure everything '.
Mr Folayo is of the same opinion: 'Women in actual fact maintain sport, including a large number of women'.
He emphasises, however, that Mrs Ferreira was not selected as a result of her 'queue identity'.
'he started energy ', as Mr Folayan says.
It is no coincidence, however, that he was in the front line, that black women are living on many counts and are at stake.
His energy is dismissed from the White Paper. "
The news groups have been leaving Ferguson a long time ago, but there is still tension between the Community and the police.
Mrs Ferreira still has two and a half years left, she was sentenced to having a motorway in a demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate is short and concise: 'Chaos'.
Nevertheless, he still relies on the slogan he learnt from the streets of external Ferguson three years ago:
'We have a duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our coffee. "
Fitting aspect: Artists create descriptions of Chelsea Manning DNA.
The Fridmand gallery in New York has rampant at the centre of the exhibition - white, black and rust faces - which, from a more precise point of view, can show unity.
These 30 works are performances made by the artist Heather Deweyer Hagborg, based on the post office of Chelsea Manning and on DNAA samples.
He sent evidence of Fort Leavenword's prison, where he was sentenced to 35 years' judgment, which condemned the leaking of diplomatic electricity classified as secret.
Deweyg A Becoming Resemance was opened at 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Deweyor Hagborg and Manning.
Deweyor Hagborg analyses the DNA and created 30 phrases from his genetic data, which are tough, although somewhat theoretical, position on the coverage of DNAs, on the multirad relationship and on the causes of the interpretations and on identity.
Chelsea Manning, his birthplace, Bradley Edward, has openly told us that he was sitting in women right from scratch, that he was found to be responsible for 20 crimes in 2013, including the violation of the espionage, cybercrime and theft.
The prison sentence on Manninga was just one image: A brutal, black and white explanation, in which the conditions in which Manning is sitting on the driver's spot, and he has been able to have a priori cancellation which came to his mark.
Deweyor Hagborga had the great merit of the Stranger Visons project that he carried out in 2012.
He created descriptions on the basis of criminal information, which received DNA information, for example, on tobacco subsidies and red tape and created images of what might have been shown by the people concerned.
Then the artist received e-mail from Paper Magazine.
'they interviewed Chelsea Manningia and needed a picture ', Deweyor Hagborg said a new exhibition at the information conference.
She was unable to visit and could not be described in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsean and asked whether she was interested in making the Manningan DNAA shaping.
Surprisingly, the Tamil and his detention became correspondents, who wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even carried out the Supplier Images report together, which was described as Shoili Kungo, describing a future in which the President would have mitigated the judgment of Chelsean and he would be able to look at exhibition.
In reality, Mr Obama's judgment was reduced only a few days after the publication of the compilation book, which was a happy coincidence after seven miles in military prisons.
It is also impressive that this exhibition is being opened at the very time when Donald Trump is engaged in his own war against information leaks and transgenital soldiers and is finding new ways in Twitteri to strengthen the strong divisions that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Deweyor Hagborg believes' everything has its purpose '.
In his opinion, the artist 's opinion is based on the opinion of the artist and on the great whistle of name in Manning, where he is at the heart of the family' s heart, and he calls for an end to the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based.
The opposite is true: There is a long list of Cs, Groups and Appeal written on lead.
This combination of 200 letters - or queue, as the scientific definition used by artists is - wants to illustrate how we are all, at least biologists.
'I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genome and that genetic manipulation is very personal and transparent for interpretation ', Deweyn-Hagborg says, and that it also includes his Spurius Memories video in 2007.
'DNA tells us countless stories. '
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: The Manning and Deweyn Hagorg Document.
That is where the Manning figure is flourishing the prison as King Kong when he goes to megafia.
"If they are kept quiet, they have won", the picture says.
"Never mind."
'The text is the letter I received from Manningen, the artist from Philadelphia. '
"It is so impressive that I still have cold colours."
Contrary to what was described in the SARS, Manning has not yet seen any exhibition, and when he comes here, he welcomes the face of his own genetic data than a number of demonstrators in the middle of exhibition.
It is deliberate, as it is all the rest of this exhibition: For example, the Manning DNAA period has been written on the lead rate, which is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
'The face was there earlier, but I wanted to bring a number of people to it ', Deweyor Hagborg says.
'I wanted to describe the mass movement born by Chelsean, which was also behind his release '.
Professor of the Northwestland University University University University and Oxford University Service are being sought with suspicion of murder.
The police tell us that they have launched the Indian search for a professor of the Northwester University and Oxford University who are suspected of treating a man to death in a chicago council.
Mr Cook 's documents show that on Monday the arrest warrant was adopted on Monday for Wydham Lathemen, 42, 56 suspected of being involved in the lives of Mr Trentin H. James Cores-Duranley, who had been sentenced to death by the arrest warrant for the murder of the first instance without the possibility of being freed from guarantees.
According to the documents, Cornellanu Duranu, 26, died after he had been interrupted several times.
According to the local information published by the Chicago police, the body was found from 27 to 7 to 2017.
The police deferred on the Grand Plaza architecture found a victim with many wounds in their bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornellanu was identified as dead on the ground, and timber was investigated, and two suspects were actively sought.
Lathem has been working as a deputy professor of microbiology and eggs at the Nortwester University since 2007.
Mr Alan K. Cubage stated in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now administrative freedom and is denied access to the champaths of the Northwester University.
'this is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating and the Northwester University will help in the investigation ', as Mr Cubage wrote.
Warre is working as an older financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
The opinion sent by the university and Sommer College, e-mail, states that 'we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are prepared to help the US authorities in every way possible'.
It also states that Mr Warrenen's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will.
The head of the police force, Anthony Guglielho, said that he was asking the suspects to be given a serious appeal to the authorities.
'The police have an idea of their place of origin and, as Mrs Guglieli said, we keep making our search. '
According to Mrs Guglieli, local, regional and national authorities will help in the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had a telephone hospitals from the office of Grand Plaza, who had received a vague suggestion that something had happened in the home.
The police described this as horrific.
According to Mrs Guglieli, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or in the past.
He told us that Lathem and Warre had been in the building.
'We believe that Professor Lathau and the victim had a relationship ', Mrs Guglielho says.
Grand Plaza 's management team published the following information to the people:' The police are currently investigating the course of events, the background to the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence '.
He threatened to explode the Islamic writer and 'kills Muslims' in London.
'I am not an ancient Muslim, I am Catholic ', said to the police.
Moffatt must carry out a 100-hour-free social service.
A 39th-year-old man was sentenced to his threats to explode the Islamic writers in London and to 'kill all Muslims'.
According to the Independent, David Moff was sentenced, among other things, to serious harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted on 23 May.
According to the staff, a man had 'threatened to explode the book and kill Muslims'.
The suspect left the trade after the threats.
He was caught by a war on the intimidation of the police.
This threat was not linked to what happened in the book trade.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had fallen into the same coin as the suspected police officer said.
I am not an ancient Muslim, I am Catholic, Mr Moffatt told the police that he had heard.
A man must carry out a 100-hour-free social service and pay 620 pounds, that is about EUR 690, legal costs and compensation for the victims, or about EUR 95.
According to Scotland Yardi's information, a number of wounds are not reported.
'We shall complete the WADAE road map in the near future '- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vey Mutko.
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Vey Mutko, has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map in order to restore the mandate of the RUADAC.
"Part of the road map has already been implemented and RUADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Committee.
The WADAE road map has been updated in this respect, "Wutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADAn road map, which lays down the conditions for the restoration of the mandate of RUADAC, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutska, it does not worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future. "
One of the points in the road map, however, presupposes that the Russian Anti-Doping authorities publicly accept the results of the study carried out by Mr WADAn, a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who will examine the state's alleged contribution to the doping of Russian sport.
I quote: "Research is under way because our anti-doping system has recognised failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist. "
In Mutko's words, the President of the Committee on Against Drugs Smith made a statement.
Mr Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian sportsman RSportu earlier the same day, admitted that Russia's anti-doping bodies had problems, "we have said on several occasions that this report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We are not going to accept this report unconditionally.
WADA ordered RUADAE to stop monitoring doping in Russia in November 2015, when the scale of the doping scandal had emerged.
Last June, however, it was authorised to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
Mr Olivier Nigeria visited the RUADAC headquarters in Moscow in July.
The British organisation, as a sceptical of Finnish innovation, is not evidence.
The British organisation doubts the benefits of maternity packaging for Finnish elephants.
Among other things, BC and Guardian say that Lullaby Trust prohibit their own prospectus from being used on maternity packets distributed in Britain.
The distribution of information packaging to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lulling trustt, there is no evidence that maternity packaging would reduce the risk of linkage.
Death is an inexplicable mood.
Lulling Trust is an expert of the British health authorities in the field of the safety of the child.
We will no longer allow our official prospectuses to be shut down because it would suggest that we recommend this product, as the organisation has informed us.
Finland has one of the world's lowest figures for child mortality, only two deaths per thousand born.
According to Lulling trustt, Finland 's good reading is due to a number of different reasons, such as the low number of theatres.
Giving every family a box may be a factor.
It cannot be said, however, that the Director-General of Lulling Baktes said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging will be marketed as products that reduce child mortality and conceal death.
It is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge for all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
Packaging contains various products, such as childcare products.
This year there are 53 products in packaging.
The packaging itself is a cardboard to which a child can be sleaked.
According to the Scottish Government, all safety standards are met.
Lulling Trust, for his part, says that there is no safety standards for evil boxes.
According to Lulling trustt, packaging can be the best way to sleep if there is no room for development or surface.
The organisation recommends that the packaging be used for the sole purpose of day-to-day trains and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
It also recommends keeping pet animals out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not grow or dirty.
Canned fish for another time from Japanese animal husbandry
The Japanese people are looking for a kilogram of carelessness.
The Indian shield has been surprised by the speed of its staff and has taken up for another two weeks.
On Tuesday morning, a kilogram of the Shibkawa animal infection in Okayama in Western Japan.
The stable seas showed that the fish left the animal husbandry through the headquarters.
It does not die immediately, because it eats food around animal disease, but we are very concerned, Mr Yaamane, who is working in animal husbandry.
The 35th-year-old fish are married, 5kg and around one metre long.
Mr Yamane describes herds as quietly and as pet.
In times of emergency, it is possible to move freely in the area of infection.
It has not received any evidence of a kilogram of manure.
The previous carcass in Kashmir took place in the week.
Mr Yamane went down the road of a caricature of 150 metres away from a zoo.
I saw this on my way to animal disease.
I was in my car and asked my colleagues, Mr Yamane, to help.
It will be able to get through more quickly than we can ever imagine.
These stories help to prevent Uberi errors.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the workers in their network trading company, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the workers were sceptical about them.
'The questionnaires were simply inconsistent and objective ', as Mr Errett says, and his hair care company Madom Reed focuses on network trade, with 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to external aid.
The market has become more and more new staff management companies, which will help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They are developing and listing software which can measure the commitment of the workers, and they can ask them and target certain roads and provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct access to the government.
'Fitbol's own health may be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbol ', but where does the company's Fitbol?' Asks the founder of the Glintsi Glintt, the Director-General, Jim Barnet, who offers companies analytical software to measure the commitment of workers?
Errett has used Glint's programme for three years and he says that he has taken a more in-depth view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
This programme will be able to carry out swift questions and votes on certain roads, and it will also be able to draw up a map which, at one point, will see the most unhappy sections of the workers and which managers have received the weakest estimates, which have enabled Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of work so that they do not become Uberia: They have died around the transport company since the former worker wrote in their bosses a culture in which workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For stories such as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business.
Corporate governance, regulation and modulation are a global sector which, according to the Let's wink payts, can increase to USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denveri, Convercent is a need to help companies detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour, an interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uberi's reputation was triangered.
Convercents has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uberi.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to carry out tailored questionnaires, to collect a confidential response in real time and to map out the problem areas.
In addition, workers can report uncalled 'irrelevant behaviour' with a text.
And if the director is suspected of being irrelevant, then complaints go straight to the business government.
"Public opinion has sidelined the authorities", says the founder of Convercents and the Director-General, Patrick Quinla.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or acts in an ethical way, the consequences may be expensive, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose workers and become challenged.
The Ruby Moesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 points; it has used Convercence for more than a year because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the policies and methods of action and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, it was customary that if a worker wanted to report the problem, he first had to clarify a telephone or an e-mail address which was able to make an announcement to the headquarters; then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
'There was often a frightening and unpleasant experience ', the leader of the judiciary in Rwanda James Vitrano, who said that it was difficult to follow up the complaints made by the workers.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another town or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be identified and dealt with more quickly.
'I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive picture of the worker's reality 'says Vitrano, who is leading the risk management group in Ruby Tesday.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from trials relating to working relations."
According to Mr Quinlank, companies started to take ethics, values and workers' commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of non-ethical activities in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the social media that companies realised that they could no longer block public debate.
'The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control '.
Glint and Convercent offer their programmes a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model and a business model accepted by capital investors, and both Glint and Convercents have their support for capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected USD 10 million from companies such as Sappahire Ventures and Tola Capie, which collected USD 47 million of capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million in November from Besser Partner and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investment is not surprising, given the link between companies, business culture and risk capital.
According to a number of studies, workers are waiting for more in their jobs.
In a competitive market such as St. Petersburg, good wages are being paid, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful business.
'The workers are more committed to the success of the company if they go to the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding ', says the leader of the Linina McQueen, who is responsible for rewarding and wellbeing workers.
It is the companies that will succeed when the workers commit themselves.
Analytical fish from third parties promise to strengthen workers' commitment, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the culture of employment, information about the commitment of workers is important;
But that would be pointless if action were not taken on that basis.
If a company asks for a return to its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change is not made quickly enough or nothing changes, the workers' commitment can be reduced.
'If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to hold four thousand debates', the Director-General of the issuing company, Mr Russell Rath, who has seen companies rely too much on simply collecting information.
"If a company does not take measures, the workers will start to consider whether they were consulted.
And is there any difference of opinion?
If a company does not ignore them, why should they pass on the company? '
According to Errett, Madeira Reed is currently carrying out staff questionnaires on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
When Errett had collected the feedback from workers who were frustrated by the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the roads and to organise communication training in order to solve problems.
Ruby is increasingly aware of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known as the great variation of workers.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose the workers", Mr Vitrano says.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
And without customers, there will be no companies. "
In Sweden, the 20-year-old man is suspected of describing his naked female neighbour, the news office TT.
At the end of the anthrax, a woman living in Göteborg had come out of his home.
According to women, a cash camera was picked up in housing.
A woman who had been ashamed of this case had drinked into another room.
When a woman had arrived to review the situation, the first step had been taken, but shortly afterwards the window was reclassified.
A suspected man has admitted that he has died.
He claimed, however, that he had only died of women's faces.
The video described in the wind had been removed and the police had not succeeded in restoring it as proof.
In the hearings, the man has admitted that he was guilty of a crime.
The man's argument was that he love his neighbour 'absolutely mad'.
According to the news office, a man is being prosecuted.
Teachers are demanding more leeway in the autumn negotiations.
Wage growth cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but should be reduced, as the President of the OAC, Mr Olli Laval, said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holiday funds highlights the difference, as he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements which do not in any way involve holiday-holdings.
Agreements will not be reached in the field of Sunday until private sector papers are signed and interest rates are clear.
A splendid forecast that the working conditions of the OAS, for example, have been agreed in January.
The laudable targets were not yet discovered.
Mr Juko, President of the Public Trade Organisation, is also a good one.
Splendid: Lomarishness increases differences in merit.
According to the OAC, the statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of employees in the public sector is being weakened while the private sector is growing.
It is a good idea that a fixed-term holiday-time period will further exacerbate the differences in income.
Finland must determine how many lessons can be drawn from one teacher per teacher.
Furthermore, the OAC points out that the equality of primary education must be guaranteed, as the differences between those who are best and the weakest are growing.
According to the organisation, training is deteriorating and the gap between pupils and regions continues to increase.
The day of the Bruinsin players, when NCAA reduced daily exercises to two.
It will soon be 11 a.m., and a number of American players from UCLAS have remained bogged down on the other side of the new field of exercises.
Some people have been deprived of their towers, who are stoning the sand since the first day of the exercising camp.
For many of them, this one or two minutes of fraud is the middle of the day.
The players studying at the university's summer courses will return to their homes after three hours of exercises and, the next morning, they will meet at the football centre in Washerman.
'The next three days will be fines for these casualties', the winner of Bruinsi, Jim Mora, says a little before Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for education reduced the number of daily exercises by two: The aim of this amendment was to reduce the number of players' work, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That is why the first trials in UCLAS started to take place over seven evening, and it was difficult for players to find room for manoeuvre.
Restricting the number of dairy companies in one day means that there are more training days, almost a week earlier this year than last, and this is the first time in the six Westwop photograph period, which has continued through Moran, while exercising at the same time as the summer courses.
These exercises are to be held 18 times before 20 August, when real preparations start to be made for the opening-up of the period: The UCLA in September is Texas A & M.
Mr Mora says that he supports the amendment of the NCAA rules, even though it made the deadlines for players even more stringent.
'We are going to bury them a great deal for three or four days and that is a challenge ', as Mr Mora says.
"But the players are prepared to work; they are fine cooks.
I believe that the situation will be made easier when we get to Saturday, when we will have more time.
It is not easy, given the direct prospect of a training structure for a detention area and the high-level hotel at Lusk Center, which has already been bombed by a network of shelter outside the paint.
Mr Bruinsin's players are due to change the hotel at the weekend, but he admits that problems could arise during a period of time when bad ones are available outside.
'We have security arrangements', as Mr Mora says.
'The worry is that people can afford to miss and describe their exercises for video, which is not an exaggerated concern.
The video described in the Harris is very much paid.
But we have watchdog there and in the parking area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to keep quiet about this.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in Rwanda in Central Africa on Friday, the victor will be made clear.
Paul Kagame officially seeks for his third period, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the RPF stopped the genocide of extremist organisations.
We were the RPF commander.
There has been criticism of, among other things, the murder of the opposition and the limitation of the word 'freedom'.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting the statistics on poverty.
For a third period, Mr Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which has been set aside by the presidency for two long periods, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, we are also a genuinely held leader.
In due course, social reforms have taken place in Rwanda and international investment has been mobilised.
In addition, Mr Kagami has played an important role in combining the land that is divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But we have also promised more freedom for our people since the country has been brought to its feet.
It could be a good moment to start.
Facebook is fighting whites by stepping up the inspection of faxes.
Mr Facebook intends to send potential lights increasingly to independent fax inspectors and to present the results of the original article, which was announced on Thursday by the world's largest social network.
The company published an opinion on its website that it is starting to use updated machinery for the identification of photographs, which may be sent to fax inspectors and may be published under the original article.
Facebotage has been criticised for being one of the main protagonists of the whistle-blowers, and many believe that the photographs had an effect on the outcome of the American presidential elections in 2016.
This is a political debate in Europe, in which French voters were bombed by false news before the presidential elections in May and Germany, preparing for September, supports the plan to finalise the social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Mr Facebook announced in a separate opinion in Germany that the verification of faxes would be tested in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
'The people want to see which stories are not passed by independent inspectors and they also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what they read and distribute ', the leader of the Faceyk news, Sara Su, wrote in the boss of the company.
He added that Mr Facebook will continue to test the relevant articles and will make further changes to his news in order to reduce the photographs.
The scapegoat of the compilation book: The story of a list.
A small Scottney walk in the county of Khent today is known as Squeez's music video and Margaret Thatcher's doctrine in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has a 700-year storm history, however, and now this wretched writer in the Bewl river is the subject of a series of photographs written by Jamie Rhodes, a mopping writer in old documents.
'I think it is wonderful to have the text written by more than 300 years ago ', as Mrs Rhodes says.
'I feel a personal connection when I look at the letter in my hand '.
The Rhodesh book, ACastle in England, reports the story of families living in Scottish from the Middle Ages to the Eardian, which each story has imagined the various artists, a promising British championship: Isac Lenkiewicz, Briony May May, William, Becky Imburg or Greng.
This is not the first paper on archives in Rhodesi, which was published in 2014 by Dead Men's Teet and Other Stories, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Legislature.
'I went to the cynical village when I read the letter on scapegoats: The letter was written by Mr Rhodes, who was working for divisions in the 17th century '.
'that was his oppression!
And letters come out of the sand, because it was used as an enlightenment at that time.
Three centuries later, the product will feel readily that he is on the spot.
I love archives! '
The author of the old documents was allowed to live almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of England, which seemed to be too good to be true, and he admits that he was not patient for a little longer than he would have wished.
He spent a Tutsman 'new fortress, archives, treasures and rumours, such as walls on the wall and centuries of admiration.
He was circumventing the old holiday on the rails and roads and talking to the foresters, the timber pieces and sometimes the performing artists.
She started to write. "
The closer history of Scotn is rather unknown, since it was only the last Friday, Elizabeth Hussein, who died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were only starting to pass the archives.
There were daily books, letters from the days of the English empire and maps of who the Commission is doing what.
It was recalled that it would be permitted to be. "
Some of the vertebral column goes on to the history of England, such as The Labour, which will tell a man who will shortly be joining the English Chancellor in 1381.
'The Families of Kent and Sussex 'states that the holiday was a mellic in 1380'.
'The Chancellor started in the same region, and it was recalled that the captain could start with the ruin.
Perhaps these events are linked? '
The rest of the book is closely linked to the history of the holiday, such as The Priest, on the priest hidden by the family of Darrelle for seven years during the English religious cleansing.
On the other hand, Mr Smugler tells us that Arthur Darrelli's story from the 1700th Century, who is said to be in breach of his own cemeteries by filling in the stone (it was detected years later).
Darrells are the favourite family of Rhodesh in Scotn.
The men of Darrelli's salt resolved their debt by going to married with the old women of the wealthy, and I see them as cooks who were buying the paper waste. "
Now, Rhodes is looking for new literature experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a compilation description of an improvement in Easte, which was carried out at the beginning of the 19000s and which only remains a tonne of feed.
The Scottish bird has a special place in his heart.
'It was sad to leave ', he says.
'I would not have liked to return to this panacea '.
Relations between Russia and the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between??????????????????????? On Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in his interview with the CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Krimin, in 2014 and the continuing instability in the Russian-Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tension does not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from escalating and the new Cold War.
Before Mr Stotenberg's comments, the American President, Donald Trump, had the time to say that he had even reached a dangerous level between the USA and Russia.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the bad-coloured Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitsho will stop - a rethink against Anthony Joshua will not happen.
The World Cup, Vladimir Klitsho, the World Cup of Amtosyrinees, will stop his career.
Ukrainian Klitsho, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
In the Atlanta Olympic Games, in 1996, Mr Klitshshko took over as a profession 69 times, winning from matches.
He held different MMMs protocols between 2000 and 02 and 200615.
He lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyso Fury snew him up in November 2015.
In April of this year, Mr Klitsho met with the stadium of Wembley, Anthony Joshua, and lost his life in 11.
Mr Joshua and Mr Klitshko were expected to face a new round in November in Las Vegasi.
However, there was no incentive to take action.
I deliberately used to take a few weeks' decision to give me sufficient distance from the Wembley match, as Mr Klitshko said in his communication.
As an amateur and professional entrepreneur, I helped everything I dreamt of and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful boxing.
I am very grateful for that.
I look at Mr Klitshell 's arguments for his decision on video.
Mr Klitshko's continental agent, Bernd Bönte, reported in a note that the decision to end was difficult for Klitshkok.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has the necessary motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, as Mr Bönte said.
Since 2009, the American actor, Hau Panettiero, has been following.
A child has a child, a daughter Caya, born in 2014.
The grandbrother of Klitshko, Vitali, is also the former Hower World Cup.
Between 2008 and 12 debts were managed at the same time by the various federations MMMs.
The Finnish Foundation is absorbed by circumstances: 'Take from Flemish'.
The Seippeaker, Mr Moven, has suffered under conditions during this summer's external border period.
He has had problems with circumstances.
Wind and cold have exported women from fibres.
There are unstable conditions in London too.
Mr Nikanen speaks of the Foundation.
The conditions have been narrow against the Speaker Mr. Nika.
I do not want to accuse the love, but it was incomprehensible that I did not even have the small seconds to travel properly, as Mr Niktien said after the Inbruck.
I have been competing and I have been here for the umpteenth time, and I have never experienced one variable subsidy in this place, as Mr Niktien said at Gamesi.
During this period, it has been extremely difficult to accuse the smile of having had such a low wind in exercises, as Mr Niktien said in the Gulf.
On Thursday, London also spoke.
It has been a challenge - whether it is cold or what.
It has been cold and wind and has taken from fibres.
There is no point in consuming energy in bad conditions.
It was 455 that he had access to MMs.
445 have gone out.
In London, it is not the same for everyone.
We must be patient and wait for a better wind.
The aim is to exceed 460 on Fridays.
Why is it that they are going to retreate abroad?
That is not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany.
I was given a sledgehammer and a standardisation of technology.
I think that we should have done the same now.
Normally, the administration has been allowed to exercise, and now it has been.
What would be the easiest thing?
25%.
A small wind will happen as long as it is a standard.
A experienced exile official fled politicians in Yle: 'We have no divisions either now or for many years'.
In spite of the favourable climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilan must keep its feet and guard against inflicting a state budget on debt, warn the Ministry of Finance of the Budgeting of Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing for decades.
He says that there is no room for division.
In 2015, Mr Yle interviewed the newly-populated Estonia on Wednesday.
The building of the State budget for next year is just beginning.
Recent pipeline proposals by politicians, including the increase in the guarantee pension, the reduction in car tax and the support of the electric wheel, will be heard by Estonia as electoral speeches.
They tell us that elections are beginning to take place, because when 10% of the State budget is financed with additional debt, we have no dividends either now or for many years.
I even think it is a disgrace to talk about divisions when debt is taken, Estonia said to Yle.
Estonia stressed that all debt is a debt to the child.
Estonia has a long experience in preparing state budgets: He began in 1978 as the Department of Finance and then worked as the Deputy Head of the Budget and as the Head of the Budget.
Most recently, he was the director of the Ministry of Labour and Industry.
Estonia pointed out in an interview that the forecast 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors believe that this is the wrong way to go as early as next year and Finland expects a 1% increase for decades.
Washington's rules for a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the Permanent Status, the Gree Carard, will be amended by a new plan for immigration.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 years, to increase the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens from other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The applicants for the new application process, who can live in English and who have the skills to benefit our economy, Mr Trump said in the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to enter the same place as the Queen.
Prinst Henrik does not want to be swept with King Margareta.
In April, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareu will be described.
The Queen Margareu, 77, and this half of the Danish Queen prinsi Henrich, 83, is not buried up with one another, is telling the Danish hook.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark are in the same place.
The royal today has announced that Prince Henrik does not want to fall into the Roskje Church, the hook says in his communication on Thursday.
According to the BTS, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the Brigades in their role in the UK family.
It is no secret that the prinst has been unhappy with its role and its rapporteur in the Danish monarchy, the chief chief journalist, Lene Bheby, commented in the press.
Mr Prinsk's decision not to bury him alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of the fact that he is not treated on an equal footing with his wife.
According to the hotel, the Queen has for a long time been aware of his wife's desire for a cemetery and understood the decision.
Honey: The car had to come on the motorway.
Toman had unmarried couples and two small children.
They did not become injured in the accident, but they will not receive the money if the other party is not reached.
In the case of the Keimolan.
The picture of the construction of II.
On Tuesday, a Vanian Tomme tells his family that he had survived in an ideal car accident.
Tomus, his unmarried couples and two small children in the couples were driving through the motorway for the Keimolan by Vanne in the direction of Husheand.
As far as body II is concerned, it was the white car that used to drive the family's car into the village, Tomme says.
Without the colourful movement, the car would have arrived on its head.
Mr Jarrut and I turned the car at the same time, and it left the gateway, Tomme says.
The family's car was hard hit.
Parents and two small children were not injured.
One child is a little less than 3 years old, another under one year.
It seems that it was quite a good luck when we had nothing at all.
No one stood up even for us, even though there was heavy traffic.
The accident took place at 5.20 p.m.
According to Toman, no one stopped in their creation, and the family soiled the centre of emergency.
They got out of the car with their own resources.
The staff of Ambuls and the rescue plant were there and the family family was checked.
The car went to the rehabilitation.
He says that he and unmarried couples have a small income, and they received aid from the winter to buy a car a few years ago.
Without information from a second car, the family does not receive any money from insurance.
That is why the family wishes to see discoveries of a car which makes it possible for the family to disappear.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children into action and to go to work without it, as Tomme says.
He saw that the car was white, the old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He felt that the car register was the beginning of a pig.
If the culprits are not adhered to, I do not know how we are going to deal with the economy, we will have to reduce each cent today.
He hopes that what has happened or what is known about it will be linked to the police.
The police force in Austria and the central New Zealand rescue plant are confirming that they have had an accident on Tuesday evening.
The title was corrected at 9.15 p.m.. Contrary to what was originally reported in the original drink, the second car did not receive the future solution according to Toman, but was driven from the kitchen to the family's car.
The proposal steered by Lota Jälta deals with human relations by means of humour - Ittemperatures are seen in the Mage theatre on Friday and Saturday.
Lota Jälen, from Kouvola, brings his espionage to Mage?
The panacea is the music theatre proposal for the past on human relations and inadequacies.
According to Mr Loka, however, it remains a good idea.
This issue is dealt with by means of humour.
It is not just emotional, he says.
The rotating summer proposal has, according to God, been implemented with a rapid budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the motion is a challenge to consider what human beings will reveal when they look at themselves.
Is he perhaps playing a role or is the other way round?
Juonese proposal confuses fax with deflation.
The person has both instructed and dragged the proposal.
He is also responsible for the lie.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working party and is not imprecise.
The director believes that, although the proposal goes beyond the ideas of young people, it speaks of all ages.
May I point out that the panacea does not directly explain his own or the working party's relationship with human beings.
Fax and physics are confused.
My own dignity will certainly be avoided.
I do not think that human relations are bad, but nor do I think that a human relationship, especially a partnership, is a prerequisite.
Many learn from their parents.
Anyone believes that Iceland carries out a topical picture of young adults aged in Finland.
According to him, many have learned a great deal about human relations with their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least it is necessary to listen to itself.
There is no need to remain a bad relationship.
It shows Minea Lordng, Niklas Raué and Otto Rocka.
The working party also includes the pump in Eena Snellman.
Music 's agreement is between God and Roca.
Love of theatre sleep in Kouvola
From Couvola, Lota Jäkle, 26, will study the theatre as the guide of the word 'Taokakay' in Turkey at the Taokakay of the University of Turkey.
There are two years behind it and there is another reproach ahead.
The passion of the theatre has started in the years of Kouvolan.
The vegetation of categories of people has been assisted in the theatre of Kouvola, showing, among other things, the Yliferum Round in Helsinki and, most recently, in Linnater Turkey.
Guidance is becoming increasingly interesting.
Last week at the Narri site in Helsinki, a great deal of censorship was obtained.
About 45 minutes of this proposal have also been seen in Turkey, at least in the town of Jenin.
At 4.8 p.m. and 5.8 p.m. and 19 p.m., much of the Couvola Mage?
For a year, a Finnish Olympic opponent recovered the horrific mood - the wind crashed.
Few sportsmen and women in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
One hundred days a year, a couple of days ago, the world was circumventing and divided its dream from the Olympic Games.
The dream was realised in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless player, but also an experiment for new species.
There will probably not be many forms of mobility on the ground, which would not have been tested once by the chemical layer.
It has been enthusiastic to learn.
There is always something new, Laos says.
Finally, one burden was to stop Lahtela in its entirety.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a mooring disaster.
As a result, his wind and both hands were crushed.
I was not at all.
Lahilla says at home.
Laos had a bad luck.
He also admits that it was possible to play a part in security.
It may sound like a laugh.
But I did not seek any borders.
It is just so tough that the neo-Olympic Games are not too fuss!
After the accident, Laos was faced with a special situation.
His urgent life stopped as I was.
It was behind a long chalk in Japan as the chief player.
Lahtela began in the wastes immediately after its own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my place.
I did not really do anything, Mr Lamy says.
Lahtela often challenged its protection in the rhythm and physics.
Surprisingly, stagnation was a good experience.
I was physically and psychologically so tired that our own ideas did not seem reasonable either.
Not even on species.
It was good to be here.
I am actually enjoying this because, for once, I was really allowed to be.
The compulsory ceasefire was a Finnish chief player.
Without stagnation, he is afraid that he would have returned to the end.
It is easier to find places that have gone by a boat than a father!
Without an accident, I would not have realised that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela began the Finnish Flemish team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer husbandry.
I change reproachi frisbeegolia!
Of course, a child immediately came from.
At worst, I was playing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a superficial treacheres, he does not insist that his complaint be the same as he did.
I am not forcing everyone to do the same.
There is room for us to be self-reliant and to become the best of the world.
The Freesle is free, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Boycotts are coming and we must be concerned.
It is here: The report on technological development in the sex sector - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer become strange.
Yes.
The boycotts are now big.
The Foundation for Responsibility Robotis, the FRR recently published a report on the development of sex taboos in the next five to ten years.
'We must start to take the spread of sex taboos seriously ', say the founder of the Foundation and the University of Noel Shary Sheffieland.
Clients can choose the type of Reverend, the form and the type of oppression.
'The boycotts are hitted, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more ', as Mr Sharon said at the public conference.
Vintage has developed from the pupils to the rubber stamp, with a noble soul of pigskin and its creative features, which remind people of their use.
The user can also adapt the Rrobl to the form and colour of the Reverend Cross in his own minds.
What is all the more worrying is that rabies have a 'personality' which makes Stephford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Vintage has developed into race boycotts with a silicone ideal.
For example, the nature of the Raltix Round can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example.
The True Company Roxy Gold has a programmed personality: Frigid Farrah looks like a baby, Wild Wendy is adulterated and so on.
"Roxy Gold 's personality is adapted as fully as possible to the personality of the user," on the website of the company.
In other words, Reverend keeps the same thing as the user.
It also has different motives:
For example, it may be tired, stupid or 'wind'.
There are many worrying aspects to the increase in Seattle, which replace genuine human relations, but what is even more dangerous is the subordination of women and direct rape fans when users approach, for example, the rabies that are designed to combat them.
True Compano compares his website with the Roxyne robott:
"Women have a vibrator," why should men not have sex robots? "
But boycotts are not just a fetter or a new sex.
Their generalisation and development reveal something more black and deeper in our culture: A step backwards towards gender equality, in which oppression is one option among others.
The majority of men, of course, do not have sex robbers, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reflects their growing preference.
The marginal phenomena, however, are a great reflection of the spirit of time.
And many will only behave curiously or injuriously if the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sex boycotts are beginning to become more common, while women's rights are under threat throughout the world and in the White House there is a President who has developed his plight on women.
The Handmaid 'Tale' is not the most worrying language, for example the images of atrocious bodies and disappeared from mining eyes.
The Republic of Ghilad is far from our reality, but it seems to be a very short journey right now.
Attempts are being made to make boycotts as much as is technically possible.
The developers of Robles want to see their skin felt real and their movements traced as far as possible into human movements.
Their 'personality', however, is far removed from reality.
It is not possible for the Reverend to move away from the relationship or the situation.
They have neither the will nor the history - no independence-free or total resignation.
They are pleasant servants.
Mr Orker.
The police doubt: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia and the group was led by the head of Iaffi.
The leader of the extreme organisation, Mr Iji, was led by a group of Australian men suspected of bringing the planned bomb to the Ethihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Herald, a person belonging to the leadership leaders had also sent building blocks to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be exported to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the safety checks.
The police do not specify why the company was interrupted.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a equipment separating toxic inertia and to take a stamp in a public place, for example a public transport tool.
The Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Republic, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One man has been released, but his hearings are also continuing.
Mr Trumpi 's good points?
Mitt Romney can show common sense.
During the Trumpi era, it has been said time and again that the strong divide between voters and men has also broken down families.
On Christmas and a day of thanks, the American newspapers were told how to deal with the newly elected relatives.
We all want to clean up our information circle.
Less attention has been paid to the ability of Mr Trumpi to unite families.
I say this because my Serb village in New York this week is a left-wing poet in Chicago who has for a long time been married against our relatives.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a strong combined effect.
Now that Mr Trump is in the White House, the Serbs all support - including the guerrilla guerrilla guerrillas with whom he has been arguing for politics for decades - suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
It is a good thing, but, more broadly speaking, there are significant risks.
Mr Trump has given the left a new post, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually deprive us all of the right.
When we talk about Trumps and 'normalisation', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer cloud over his tricks.
In the long term, it is even more horrifying that Mr Trump should normalise the right extremist republicans who, compared with Trumph, suddenly appear to be quite reasonable.
I recall the madness of Mitt Romney: Dog with cars disappearing, 14% income tax (and indeed his tax declaration), which, compared to Trumpi, seem to be very lenient.
Once the Trumpi era is over, the next presidential candidate for the Republicans will only have to be clear, and that seems immediately to be a considerable improvement.
When the Serb was visiting me, we put our children on the brink of the central park, which is the main caricature of the New York park and the best that can be done in New York with three dollars with no homeland.
The horse horse horses are enormous, the creatures in the middle - the bulk chlorine and the horror to look at animals - are beautiful and the underlying shield music is strange.
Time and time again, many of the aforementioned circles in New York are disappointing: The prospect of high-level buildings starting to flourish, the photographs of the city are too tired and the reality of the city is not matched by dreams.
After 35 years, Swiss Cotge is not a Swiss monster, it is a major traffic circuit in the north-west of London.
On the other hand, the map of the central park continues to be a curious one - even to the point that it enjoys two years old, one year-old and two two four-year-old women.
I would have given the map all the stops if someone had asked me for my assessment, but fortunately nobody came to ask.
On the other hand, I was asked in a trademark this week to assess my 'experience of payments' by one in five seconds before I put my credit card on the literate.
The same thing happened in coffee, but it also gives me the opportunity to combine the 15% service when I go to seek a coffee shield.
This will slow down the day-to-day interaction and put pressure on the customer to stop his family in a situation in which it is not necessary.
He smiled to be sorry when I tirelessly gave my credit card to my experience of use in five hands.
Shefki Kuq received the bullets from the Internet - "he was the trust of the leadership".
The FC Inter has today freed the Shefki Kuq Representatives' mission.
It is up to the Fabrizio Piccarta, who used to be a donor.
The rest of the Executive Group will continue to play its current role.
In the past, an Italian Piccar has been a donor in the English Sunderland, for example.
In January, the five-year-old Piccar, which was connected with the Intergroup of Info-Points, has carried out a UEFA Pro licence last year.
The President of the FC, Stefan Händer, deplores what has happened.
It is never an easy or pleasant task to change.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had confidence in the leadership of the club, and so there was no alternative now, Mr Heights commented on the follow-up in a report.
The Picisarta agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He, together with the rest of the Executive Group, is responsible for tomorrow 's home visit to HIFC.
According to Iltat. Sans' information, the team has died on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Mr Kurai told players that the assistants of the club, Mr Piccarta, and Mr John Allen, have been sidelined.
Last Saturday, Mr Kuwait and Mr Picisarta took a strong stand on the Internet against PS Kemia.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of youth in the 80s - does the student recognise a serious wine student?
In Instagrade, the supreme Mayor of Linda Lampenius published a picture of youth.
A number of casualties have been added, which lead to the conclusion that the walls are on the brink of a sixteen-year-old student of Sibelic Akatea.
Mr Lampenius itself is wondering about young women who are considered to be a serious camera.
Long ago, serious, he sends out a message.
If the picture does not appear, you can look at it.
In the past, Mr Lampenius has published pictures of its past and has also spoken about fascinating subjects.
Just a year ago, he published a few descriptions of his own.
He is seen 20 years ago in the second image, in the second place he is now posted as a mother of two children.
In his consumer text, Lampenius looks at its own growth as a human being and refers to the problems of cancer that he suffered as a younger person.
Twenty years ago and today...
I still seem to be much the same as that 26th-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learnt to keep myself and what I think, Lampenus wrote.
After all, the text had added to life, malnutrition, uncertainty, self-confidence, love self-confidence, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, obsolete.
Mr Lampenius has spoken openly about his hunger for previous years.
He was in hospital for 14 years because of his anticyclical and organ.
A little later, he also suffered from Bull, which finally became apparent only in 2006.
The improvement started with a small amount of effort.
In addition to therapy and comparisons, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital because of breast corps.
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the wildlife he had on his beaches, which, according to the prison authorities, was able to get his way.
Pistorius was sentenced to murder after the selected sentence of the prosecutors.
He killed Sthens in the early hours in 2013 by shooting several ferries through the WC door at home in Pretoria.
Mr Pistorius claimed that he thought he thought it was a girl who was hiding in the WC.
The prosecutors have told us that they are going to complain again because they consider the sentence of the Pistorius six years too fitting.
The Supreme Court is going to appeal to the Supreme Court in Southern Africa and this appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the judgment of the Pistorium could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece.
Two Bulgarians arrested illegally in Greece, announced the BTV channel.
In Sithonia on 1 August, two Bulgarians were among the police.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the television channel BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced its release from the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules for the area of leisure and already impose heavy fines on all those who remain in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry has announced that the right to impose the penalty may be the case.
Nesden shares sinks - loss of 7.7%.

Meat, milk products and chocolate may relieve irritating salt syndrome.
Meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmare of the food merger system.
Support research, however, maintains the opposite: A diet containing a great deal of meat protein and milk products may eat the symptoms of irritating salt.
An irritating salt syndrome is an incurable disease with approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain, causing stomachers, tourism, recurrence or bloodshed.
Those suffering from an irritating salt are generally called upon to avoid meat and milk products, but the Washington University researchers found that the necessary amino acidiology in protein will help the body to develop immune cells which will strengthen my ability to act.
According to the director of the investigation, Marco Colom is controlled by immune and ensure that the harmful microbians in food do not get into the body.
Cells that result from infection will be balanced, which strengthen the capacity for action, and which will protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the future, it may lead to an irritating salt syndrome.
The tests found that there are molluscs with a certain bacteria in salt.
This bacteria needs a doctrine if there is to be an outbreak of immune beer, which is one of the protein building substances.
'We saw the connection between the development of cells promoting Lacibacius reuteri and the development of cells that contribute to the capacity of intelligence.
'The more the diet there were trastographs, the more they had such immune. '
If the same goes for human beings, the combination of the Lactobacillus reuteri diet with a great deal of translator fax can strengthen the salt's ability to behave and reduce its incitement.
When looking at immune cells to strengthen their capacity, Dr Luisa Cervante-Barraga found that, although there were such cells in one group, they were not in the same mg of chickens that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was in relation to the microbiomass of the salt of dogs, that is to say, the food merger channel, the normal community of bacteria, pigs and viruses.
When DNA was investigated, six bacteria different people were found in the skies that had other beer, but not in other parts.
By giving Lacibacillus reuteri bacteria to retailes, which had no microbio-biomass in the Finnish salt, without any immune beer, they started to be exposed to immune beans.
The scientists wanted to see the impact of bacteria on the immune system, which brought Lacibacillus retard in liquid and moved small liquid - without bacteria - into other parts of the beer.
The transformation was developed as cells to strengthen the ability to act.
When an active ingredient was cleaned up from liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the transmission of DM 3.
When researchers doubled the number of tritias in hair feed, the number of cells to strengthen the capacity for fraud increased by around 50%, and when the number of militias was halved, the number of cells fell by half from the past.
According to Cervante-Barragani, a human being has the same capacity to strengthen it as in a skies, and most of us have Lacibillus in our food merger channel.
It is not yet known whether by-products from Lacibacillus reuteri can be developed in the same way as in cats, but with irritatively irritated salt for those affected by the symptomatic disease.
'We certainly want to contribute to the development of such cells, because they regulate the Info-Poraga ', Cervante-Barraga.
"High tritifax levels combined with Lacibacillus reuteri may contribute to their becoming more widespread".
According to Jost Mourinho, Manchester Union was given a wind after concluding an agreement with Nemanator Matici.
Jospe Mourinho believes that Manchester United obtained an agreement with Nemanator Matici, the central player, in Manchester Union theatre, on Wednesday evening.
In Dublin, before the UEFA was taken up against Real Madrid on Tuesday, he made an impressive contribution as a mediator, Paul Pogba and Andreas Perea.
Matic was not yet in the best condition, however, because he was not involved in the Aegean Round before the start of the period, who only took 45 minutes on the ground - according to Mr Mourinho - has to change before the beginning of the Sicily period.
'he needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a giant - he has a natural football mentality. '
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later '.
Not only Matici, but also the newcomers, Victor Lindeland Romelu Lukay, were beginning to start a game at the Avivar stadium, when Mourinho began to start to start to make a headache for the beginning of the period.
Independent this week revealed that Mr Mourinho still wants three new players, even though the club has already done 'excellent work' by making three of the four players he has given priority.
"Three out of four - and that is something for which I should like to thank", he added.
'I am more pleased if I get all four, but they did an excellent job '.
Extremes were tempted by Germany for two times.
The Finnish women 's flight team lost their fourth round of MMMs in Germany directly between 325, 2325, 1425 and 1425.
The level of play in Germany is high.
They were in every sector, the Finnish chief accountant, Tapio Kangasniemi, reported in a note.
In the first two, Finland kept its opponent on the brink, but in a third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading a blockade.
When we had enough patience and aggression in certain places, Mr Kangasnius said.
The most effective thing in Finland was 14 points in the collection of Piia Korakas.
On Sunday, Finland will have lost three matches.
Reuters: The great jury has already sent challenges in connection with the Trump JRC meeting with Russia.
In the United States, the major whites have sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jrt and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitsky.
The great public prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the Donald Trump Jritsis and the Russian lawyer known as Natalia Veselnitsky.
The news office Reuters, who, at the same time, confirms the information displayed by Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large public authority has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Mr Trump Jritsky and Mr Veselnitsky, who were known as the 'Veselnitsky', which was held between the American presidential elections in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr. the then campaigner of the campaign, Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner, the current adviser to the White House.
According to the sources of Reuters, the fact that the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has convened a large public prosecutor in Washington means that the Russian investigation will be intensified.
The sources add that Mr Mueller wanted a study to help the great whistle-blowers to clarify Russia's involvement in the American presidential elections and whether he did not cooperate with Russia on this issue.
The great jury extends the right of Mueller to collect evidence, to send out challenges and to force people to prove themselves lightly.
It is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The large public prosecutor is considering the evidence that he has investigated and deciding whether or not to prosecute.
British inventor, microchips, in order to reach his home and car with the hand.
British inventors have been the first microchief in the country to open up their homes, get their offices and start their cars with the hand.
The microchip is between the 33th anniversary of Steve Northam 's beaches and the ante, and now he offers companies and individuals who want to make life easier by means of the technology of the Northam BioTeq company.
Northam cooperates with the doctor of the Ryal Hampshire hospital in Winchester, the doctor of the Ryal Hampshire council in the hospital, Geoff Watson, so that the attitude of the microchip fulfils the medical requirements.
Microchip uses the same technology as the microchip of cats and dogs, and its attitude only takes 30 seconds.
Northam's attempt to convert houses and cars into line with the microchip.
Northam is married and has one child: He has installed microchips, both his home and BMW Z4, which begins when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The exhibition of the White House cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
The last month of the White House's decision to fly the helicopter of the maritime forces into the southern corner of the White House to pay the taxpayer USD 24 000.
The name Marine One, when the President is in office, is used for the Green Sikorch VH3 helicopter, which was a hydrol at the 5.7.20-17 event in the White House in which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials were familiar with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connectic, samples were sailing from Maina, palace Wisconsin and truk from Missir.
The White House Military Office had only asked for 36 hours before its entry into the southern corner for 'exceptional', as is evident from the documents of the HMXC-1helicopter fleet.
'I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event which gives a great deal of visibility ', the commander of the HMX1 unit wrote on the day before that event in an e-mail to his email man, who is the Deputy Supervisor of the Maritime Forces.
It was reported that the helicopter would arrive in the south at 17.7 a.m. and the event would start three times this afternoon.
In addition, it was stated that if the helicopter left the White House were to be delayed, another crew would be required because of restrictions on the time of service.
The original crew was in helicopter and the staff of the unit were the helicopter when it was there.
The documents received by the TIME are not clear as to whether another crew needed in the end.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX1 asked whether this incident was in breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether Hatch Aceh was in breach," we were told that Commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you can take part", the Deputy Commander replied.
America was an official event in White House, so it was not covered by Hatch Aceh.
But there are also official events in political terms.
At the time, the President spoke in favour of health reform, which was dealt with at Senate level, and of less tailor state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
They must use them on their way;
But it is unusual to use them for photographs.
Mr Trumpi's actions aroused attention in February when Air Force One rushed into the background to the President's campaign in Melbourne in the Länder of Florida, where Mr Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's plane in Twitteri.
'The white house is very pleased with the made in America which presented products from American workers' American materials from all 50 states'. Lindsay Walter, the press secretary of the White House.
The staff of HMX1 regularly make training flights to Washington and in the south, in order to bring the President to Belarus on the dot of the cents of his house.
When Mr Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX1 made 58 exercises in the white house.
According to one official, flights in the made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The helicopters of the unit were also fitted on that day with eleven hours of presidential support.
According to the White House, it did not cost the taxpayer any more.
Mr Sikorska's spokesman told us that the company was not involved in organising the helicopter's presentation in the southern corner of the White House.
HMX1 has no accounts for flights to the President's duties, and it is difficult to assess the costs of this event carefully.
According to the Ministry of Defence in 2017, the rate of compensation for the VH3-30 helicopter is USD 380 per hour.
According to the documents of the HMXC unit, flights from the Quantico base to the White House and back to a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using helicopter is clearly lower.
'The reduction in the cost to the taxpayer is misleading ', as Walter says.
'an estimated level of compensation includes staff, rehabilitation and many other so-called uprooted costs, which are taken into account in the annual budget '.
According to the report by the RAND research company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account the costs of fuel, rehabilitation and contract.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, the former press secretary of White House, defended the use of helicopter.
'The idea is to present American production ', as Spicer said.
'I know that Sikorch and the State of Connectic are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and therefore will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I believe that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopter and other defence equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to point it out. "
It is not certain whether Mr Trump will be in the helicopter, but at least he sleeping the fire driver.
In the White House, Mr Trump drained the press from his own Sikorsky ship.
'I know Sikorsky very well ', the President said:' I have three. '
A ladder for Vaasane - trains have to be replaced by buses.

The public prosecutor in Venezuela calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The Venezuela Public Prosecutor has sought a court ruling which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
President Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, has announced that the elected representative elected last Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
During a controversial vote, a representative was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Luisa Medina Ortega, the decision to block has been asked for because of electoral misgivings.
Mr Medina Ortega has also started voting on election fraud.
He appointed two judges after the vote by the British delegates told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately one million more than the number of real voters.
It was only with Maduro's allies that it had a condition, and the 555th Members have the abyss and wife of Maduro among others.
In addition to amending the Constitution, representatives can break the opposition Congress and change the law.
Maduroa has been described as a dictator.
The measures taken by Maduro have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitution to be a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduroi and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have announced that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in that country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Many people have been injured and more than one hundred have died.
Venezuela lost oil prices in the economic crisis.
Today, many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate its opinion on Friday, when the new representative is due to start.
A Russian man extradited by Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States.
On Thursday, Maxm Senah was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by the Court of Justice in the United States.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of an American demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontantan, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was back home.
In February 2016, Finland handed over to the US judicial authorities in Senegal to the United States of America, despite Russian protests, is reported by the news office, Mr AFP.
He was found guilty in March this year of a computer campaign which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after prison.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reproached Finland harshly after the arrest and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing beforehand.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the Eburyn computer virus which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
This virus was used to fish users' names and salmonella.
It was then used by sportsmen and women by stepping up the flow of the Internet, which led to chickens and spam being disseminated.
According to the leader of the Department of Justice, Kennh Blanc, the case shows that the United States is also able to divide up other workable criminals.
We have the ability and the will to identify, find and bring them to justice, as Mr Blanco said in a communication.
At 8.58 p.m., the name of the convicted person has been corrected.

The themes of the work are light and illness - day and night - sun and die.

Two men killed the trade centre in Espoo
Two men were born in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties involved, the rice was born when the other party was involved in an injured time.
There was a glorious dispute between drivers.
The driver who has been driven by a banned driver would be a driver of another car, as a result of which this car was set in motion by a crash.
He then found a car that was still encountered.
In an initial speech, the man has admitted that he has caused damage and has done the wrong thing.
The title of the question from Timo Soi was: 'Then there was a watershed'.
The Foreign Minister, Timo Soini, published a brick river called a question mark on Thursday.
The letter is brief, just two words.
During my time, the party rose from zero to a party of thirty-seven Members of Parliament.
Then there was the watershed, now all the clock, Soi writes.
There are indications in the Soi text in France of the 1700th century.
King Ludvig XV or this love-love madame de Pompadouri are known to have used a water catalogue.
Depending on the interpretation, the words of history have remained "the lack of water" or "after me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women.
The elections will only be representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, as the leader of the UN delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Baroness Haysom, the provisional leader of the UN Assistance Mission Mission, said that there are hundreds of women in the elections of the Legislative Councils, three women seek to be Vice-President and more than 30% of the voters who have recently been registered.
'The role of women cannot be overemphasised ', as Mr Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Elections in Afghanistan will take place at 5.4.2017.
The Taliban have presented electoral threats while international forces are moving towards a consultative role.
The elections this year will be the first time that power is transferred peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that the contribution of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million women are registered from 3.6 million.
Fridays are hundreds and wind
Friday brings a great deal of rainfall to the south.
There is a rain in in the town and there is quite a wind.
This afternoon, the pilot flourishes and can develop utilities.
This evening is clearer and more pragmatic.
The Front brings a great deal of rainfall to the south and to the centre of the country, and the South may also appear from the baby.
This evening, there are lunch winds in the south and there is more clarity, and there is still room for a river's season.
The seasonal state of affairs is around 15, with a more integrated harvest off the south-west coast close to 20%.
In the north, the mockery varies and becomes local afternoon.
During Friday and Saturday, the low pressure will dominate the weather in the south and centre of the country, and the rainfall is general.
In the north, the rainfall remains low.
On Saturday, hundreds of people in the southern and central parts of the country also occur.
It also extends to some of the Kaint.
In the north, this afternoon it will be ravaged and it will be individual rain.
The southern coast is south-west, the virus in the central and northern part of the country is identical.
On the north-east of the British Islands, there is strong pressure from the Foundation to bring abundant fines to the south of Fennoscandia.
In Western and central Europe, there is a western air flow and there will be some hot spoils.
In southern Europe, the swim is sun and hot, and temperature is higher than 40% in some places.
In the eastern part of the Mediterranean, there are utilities.
Floods of certain types of tourism pose a threat to the culture of the region.
The authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rain is particularly targeted at cruise ships in the form of tourism.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it 'eu and Flee': There are only a few hours and a few hours at the top of the list.
Venice is a source of inspiration for tourists in towns.
It is difficult to move around the streets and the great gaps are so full of visitors that the people of Venice are no longer on the list.
They have been forced to move ever further from an historic centre, while hotels have become the place of the homes.
The problems raised by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon bad weather in Tourism.
When a large-scale cruise ship arrives, time is given for two or three hours.
The doctrine from St Petersazzale to the Roman Rialton and the Pyhun Markus, the Italian Minister for Culture, Dario Franceschini, is describing the tourist which causes problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the activities of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of urban identity.
The holy Markus is also one of the most popular visits by the historic centre of Venice.
On the brink of history, the Church of Morocco is situated.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
50 000 local people live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were approximately 175 000 people.
In July, an estimated 2 000 boat protests were made against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, is destroying the environment and driving the people out.
Around 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, there will be no more than tourists in a few years' time in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, saying that the demonstration was organised by Carlo Belfrauus.
It is difficult because they bring to Venice the income that it urgently needs and create the need for a large number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to restricting the number of people involved, the solution is designed to ensure that the Christians go further than the historic centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Borut, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Venice administrative area, where Venice is also located, were to have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Every year around 2030 million tourists are visiting Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopia?
High levels of congestion in motorway
On Thursday afternoon, the motorway between Kuopia and Siiland has been the norm for repatriation time of kilometres.
The region is carrying out the motorway work, which is slow down transport, is telling us what Mr Savo has to say.
There is a 50 km limit on hours' hours instead of normal education.
However, in the 50 km limit area, traffic had progressed practically at a crossroads on Thursday afternoon.
It is on Thursday afternoon that it is going through the Siilian lakes station, that is to say the golden load.
I will do well without any such consideration.
The two-year-old shield has had to discover the cornerstones of public opinion.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures, for example, in the landscape of Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, the Danish Norway, has become a popular sportsman, not least because in March he breached the old Norwegian record of 400 metres in the Gulf by circumventing the Round at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 metres axis for Norway 's record at 5.38.
After its record, Mr Iuel, who is actively engaged in the social media, will soon see that there is a lack of dignity and public attention.
Men around the world started to send the pictures of their Iuelle genital bodies, obviously in the hope that the young supplier would be interested in them.
The Iuel was forced to close its Snapshot.
I received many pictures from unknown people, so I was forced to turn my accounts into private, Mr Iuel told the VG.
Mr Iuel did not want to identify exactly the images he received in an interview with the VG.
You can imagine, Iuel laughter.
It is laudable to receive a return after the event, but I will be able to do so without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Dane, a father Danish.
The Iuel family changed to Norway with the age of 2.
In the wake of the fatal work of the twelve-year-old family, Namibia was first moved to Pakistan.
Then Mr Dubai, Mr Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university journalist in Los Angeles, which returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is studying three lights: Leif Olav Alquesi, Kars Warholy and Elisabeth Sletney.
Norway is much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the United States, whistle-blowers are not asking anything, but merely issuing rules.
In Norway, the player has much more time to deal with the sportsman personally, as Iuel said to the VG.
Amalie Iuel keeps Norway 's record of 400 metres and 400 metres of aeroplane.
The disability was reduced by the Vietnamese lar Janne Korve's entire career - now at Mushi: 'How when nothing happens'.
It has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janny Korai, which is one of the most successful Vietnamese people in Finland, has again been able to enjoy its loved species.
Last summer, the career was at stake.
The strain from the table had been forced on the Cork reduction table in January and the pedestrian will had no improvement.
It had also taken the place in the cat.
In the summer, I did not know what I did.
The tyrannies were bitter and many things were open, Mr Korakas says.
But it is said that things are customary.
The pedestrian, sponsorship, went on for two years, and blood started to be dragged on.
It was then easy.
I knew that at the latest when I went on to read.
I was in favour of haemophiliacs, but this is such a fun thing, and one or two more.
Mr Korakas did not get down properly until September, but after a long invoke, it has been a great leap.
Mr Korakas has only been circumvent by a few.
That does not matter.
Competition has never been the most important weapon of Saturday in Corvo.
I have never counted for one cat.
He thinks it is frustrating to set four years in motion, and then we heard it in the week.
I am not going to think that, Mr Korakas says.
Today, Corsica is cold in the Speaker of the MMMMs in Sierra Leone in Spain.
Even if individual cats do not like him on Saturday, they are always sleeping at home.
According to the Korakas, the prestige of the games organised by the International Coal Union has grown over the past few years, even though some Saturday people chose Norway X.
Yes, these are important files and visibility is great.
However, as I see it, respect always depends on the conditions and the level of the games.
In Sierra Leone, Mr Korakas is the oldest sportsman of the Finnish Speaker.
The photographs of the team, the Rene Rinneegas and Emm Parkingeng, are 14 years younger.
It is hard to follow the expenditure of the younger.
I remember that everything was new and was so ill.
It brings itself a new post, Mr Korakas is thinking.
I still have something left behind in the Round, but otherwise I will not.
Janne Korakas has also built a different sporting career.
The Mayor of Pek Korve has been appointed: The slogan has his own borders, for which he makes rehabilitation programmes.
As I am on the right track all the time, I cannot do more.
I believe, however, that every day, at least food outcomes and, in general, something from the point of view of the Korakas.
According to the Korakas, guerrillas and locomotives are a potential career plan when Saturday comes to a conclusion.
I am not going to go so far, but that is at least likely.
I see it as much as I study it along with the Vietnamese.
I will try to remain sensitive and evolving over time, perhaps in the summer.
If it is a future profession, it will not be difficult to start when it is already ready in a species.
There is also the issue of the Elitis rain with the country.
Kathakhstan has spilled a cruise vessel, which, at the end of May, is going to lead to the Eliten fodder in Stockholm.
Mr Korakas and Mr Linnonland chose to reinstate the old tradition.
It has gone a long way and people have been enthusiastic.
It is already happening that there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months later, we hope that the ship will be complete, that Mr Korakas will say with his enthusiasm.
Everyone has been surprised by the magnitude of the Atkins project for Keali.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new hot of people of 41s.
Next summer, the building of 1 700 kerosene metres will be prepared on the other side of the health centre's neighbour, Terveyster.
The general question is where the new care unit is sufficient for clients, because now, during the Siun wars, many private care homes are shrinking.
Anne Flink Attendi, regional leader of the postal services, commented that in future there will be more demand, not only for alternatives, but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, then Mr Flink says.
Last year, Mr Attendo was good enough to provide private care facilities for Kealand and Eert.
Trade was a business issue, but there is a five-year agreement on buildings.
Mr Flink says that there is no need to remove activities from these farms.
More will be done on this subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the activities of the Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leader of the McVitie discovery industry for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB department of Scotland, the company has not reported its plans for the future.
The Hobnoband Tea plant has more than 500 employees.
The McVitie Platform company told us that it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will certainly be told the first 'if changes are made.
In a letter to the Commissioner, GMB urges the company to 'respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated to modernising production levels'.
Drew Duff is extremely concerned that the company manager will not be given clear information about the needs of the Tolland business and future investment plans.
'For families have been working here for generations and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow region, which is a major source of employment in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and from the point of view of Brittany, the growing cost of living and production, the East of Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie '.
According to Platform's information, the director of the factory had received a letter from the trade union only on the last day and the company directly responds to the letter because it appreciates the ongoing interaction between workers and trade union representatives.
'We had a regular meeting with workers and representatives of the GMB in Tolland two months ago when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the workers, amongst other things, the fact that, like other very competing and insecure companies in the market, we will continue to assess all our business and our points of view in order to maintain our competitiveness'.
According to the information, over the last few years, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tolland factory, in particular its production and its improvement.
'We are aware of the long history of Tolland as a production plant and we will certainly be the first to tell workers and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the workings'.
Did PSG Barcela have been moved three years ago?
Lake Liga may lose his interest in Marco tax.
Paris Saint- Germai does not give up the ambition of Nymarn, having paid 189 million pounds, but did PSG Barcelia warn of the record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 team is prepared to break the world record of transfers, which was less than half the year: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester Union Towards 89 million.
After the transfer, Nymar will become the world's most expensive football player, including the world's most paid professional sportsman, because PSG will offer him more than 500 000 pounds a week after taxes.
It is known that Barcelona is raging over the activities of the PSG and the way in which Neymar Neymar has been forced to follow, a source close to Barcelona which indicates that the club has kept a great deal of concern to Nymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG expect this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City declared that he was interested in Blair Matul in 2014, Nasser Alfi was warned by the PSG clubs for the best players.
'I am not concerned, because they know that if they seek our players, we will be their opponents and we will contact them ', as All-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they will face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: It expressed its interest in the central PSG player earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its supplier, Nymar.

Now: The Trumpi hefty phones were invented - the White House spokesman: 'I would not say that it was a lie'.
The white House acknowledges that the two telephone calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trumpi, never met, tell us the New York Times.
The Trumpi phones with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the partisan organisation have proved to be inventive.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no telephone calls.
He said, however, that Mr Trump did not complain.
According to Mr Sanders, a number of partisan leaders spoke to Trumpi personally, and Enrique Pena Niittp, President of Mexico, had spoken to Hamburg at the G20 meeting.
I would not say that it was a lie, it is a rather tough accusation.
These discussions took place, not only in the telephone but also in the face, Mrs Sanders-ten.
Talk to the Maoists was a source of disapproval.
On Monday, Mr Trump told him that the President of Mexico had praised him and praised him for his success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Mr Trumpi, Pena Nieto told us that a few will no longer come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the journey will, in any case, weaken the border with the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a communication stating that this telephone had not happened.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of the interview with The Wall Street Journal.
It called Mr Trump for his speech at a major meeting of the National Partnership for the West Virginia.
I received a telephone from the leader, who said that it was the most wonderful speech ever made to them.
They were very grateful, Mr Trump said.
On Wednesday, the partisan organisation informed us that it was not aware of any of its leaders' telephone calls to Trumph.
According to the information, the leader of the organisation, Michael Surbaugh, spoke out against the partisan.
The speech by Mr Trumpi at the meeting of the Association of the Regions caused a great deal of astonishment, because it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he dismissed the outcome of last autumn's presidential elections.
