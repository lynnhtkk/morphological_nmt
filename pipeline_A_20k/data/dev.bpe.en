a 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old che@@ f who had recently moved to San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co was found dead in the sta@@ ir@@ well of a local m@@ all this week .
but the victim &apos;s bro@@ ther says he can &apos;@@ t think of anyone who would want to hur@@ t him , saying , &quot; Th@@ ings were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the W@@ es@@ t@@ field M@@ all Wednesday morning was identified as 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co resid@@ ent Fran@@ k Galicia , the San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co Med@@ ical Ex@@ a@@ min@@ er &apos;s Office said .
the San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment said the death was rul@@ ed a hom@@ ic@@ ide and an investigation is ongoing .
the victim &apos;s bro@@ ther , L@@ ou@@ is Galicia , told A@@ B@@ C sta@@ tion K@@ G@@ O in San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co that Fran@@ k , previously a line co@@ ok in B@@ os@@ ton , had lan@@ ded his dream job as line che@@ f at San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co &apos;s s@@ ons &amp; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant six months ago .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for s@@ ons &amp; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters said they were &quot; sho@@ cked and devasta@@ ted &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small team that oper@@ ates like a close k@@ ni@@ t family and he will be de@@ arly missed , &quot; the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
our thoughts and cond@@ ol@@ ences are with Fran@@ k &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
L@@ ou@@ is Galicia said Fran@@ k initially sta@@ yed in hos@@ tel@@ s , but recently , &quot; Th@@ ings were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an a@@ part@@ ment , he was dating a g@@ ir@@ l , &quot; L@@ ou@@ is Galicia told K@@ G@@ O .
L@@ ou@@ is Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hur@@ t his youn@@ ger bro@@ ther .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connec@@ ting with the family was always making us a dis@@ h , making us d@@ inner , &quot; L@@ ou@@ is Galicia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of alter@@ cation .
he was the bro@@ ther that went with the flow .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that di@@ amon@@ d in the rou@@ gh that was sh@@ ining b@@ right every day , &quot; he said .

j@@ uni@@ or doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of j@@ uni@@ or doctors have called on their union to author@@ ise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the J@@ uni@@ or D@@ oc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ D@@ C ) of the British Med@@ ical Association ( B@@ M@@ A ) is to ask its full coun@@ cil to back more industrial action from early September .
the J@@ D@@ C says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
j@@ uni@@ or doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the B@@ M@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ball@@ ot .
in a letter to members released on T@@ wit@@ ter on Thursday night , the J@@ D@@ C &apos;s chair E@@ ll@@ en Mc@@ Court said the government had remained &quot; persis@@ ten@@ tly sil@@ ent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the J@@ D@@ C Ex@@ ecu@@ tive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re@@ -@@ negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , J@@ D@@ C ex@@ e@@ c has today made a formal request for a special meeting of B@@ M@@ A Council to author@@ ise a ro@@ lling programme of escal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispute has led to j@@ uni@@ or doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all@@ -@@ out sto@@ p@@ pa@@ ges in the history of the N@@ H@@ S .
the B@@ M@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tor leader , D@@ r J@@ o@@ han@@ n M@@ ala@@ w@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the B@@ M@@ A had recommended .
he had told B@@ M@@ A members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the pol@@ l of 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors and medical students .
following the vote , Health Secretary J@@ er@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t said the contract would be imposed on medic@@ s in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &apos; alliance of mis@@ f@@ its &apos; ?
it was a ges@@ ture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tu@@ es@@ day to sha@@ ke hands and declare a formal end to an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir Putin gre@@ e@@ ted his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ il@@ ded h@@ all of a S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg pal@@ ace , I got the distinc@@ t impression that An@@ kar@@ a wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ sha@@ ke , yes .
but Mr Putin &apos;s s@@ mil@@ e looked th@@ in and he was hardly o@@ o@@ z@@ ing warm@@ th even by his own res@@ trained standards .
Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Er@@ dog@@ an by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Mr Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
he also pled@@ ged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre@@ -@@ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described Mr Er@@ dog@@ an as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm imp@@ li@@ ed the opposite .
but a l@@ ing@@ ering co@@ ol@@ ness em@@ an@@ ating from Mr Putin showed that Russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey &apos;s sho@@ ot@@ ing down of a Russian fi@@ ghter plan@@ e on the Sy@@ rian border .
Mos@@ cow &apos;s reaction at the time was fu@@ ri@@ ous .
Mr Putin las@@ hed out , acc@@ using An@@ kar@@ a of sta@@ b@@ bing Mos@@ cow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
re@@ building real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , sta@@ te@@ -@@ controlled media conducted a sta@@ gg@@ ering , all@@ -@@ out off@@ ensive against An@@ kar@@ a .
all of a sud@@ den , it seemed like Tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accus@@ ations from top officials that Mr Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s own family has pro@@ fi@@ ted from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so@@ -@@ called Islamic State .
he &apos;s denied that empha@@ tically .
but in S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apolog@@ y he demanded from President Er@@ dog@@ an .
Russia could claim a victory of sor@@ ts .
for An@@ kar@@ a the benefits of calling a tru@@ ce are clear .
first and foremost , Er@@ dog@@ an needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ous@@ ted from power last month in a failed cou@@ p .
repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly sha@@ ken him too .
there is also an economic mo@@ tive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million Russian touris@@ ts to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has s@@ lu@@ mp@@ ed by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , t@@ our operators and charter companies here will certainly be reli@@ ev@@ ed when flights eventually resu@@ me .
they &apos;@@ re banking on a la@@ te@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on rus@@ h to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state T@@ V has been predic@@ ting che@@ aper fruit and vege@@ tables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; touris@@ ts that way , tom@@ a@@ to@@ es back here , &quot; as a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ os@@ ti newspaper ph@@ ras@@ ed it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Mos@@ cow .
An@@ kar@@ a is ang@@ ry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attemp@@ ted take@@ over .
add to that its long@@ -@@ standing gr@@ ud@@ ge at the s@@ na@@ il &apos;s pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to cap@@ italis@@ e on the ch@@ ill and chi@@ p away at Turkey &apos;s ties with the West .
the Russian leader certainly won b@@ on@@ us points with An@@ kar@@ a for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attemp@@ ted cou@@ p .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for Mos@@ cow which has its own deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this gl@@ it@@ z@@ y , se@@ aside pal@@ ace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analys@@ t described to me as an &quot; alliance of mis@@ f@@ its &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mis@@ treated by the West , joining forces .
still , despite the public dis@@ play of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is Syria , where Mos@@ cow has recently been cas@@ ting itself as pe@@ ac@@ em@@ ak@@ er but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presid@@ ents told a press conference that they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even touched on the topic .
Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answ@@ ering a question on their differences , while Mr Putin ch@@ ose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ til@@ ity - and given the potential for ut@@ ter disaster when Na@@ to member Turkey sho@@ t down that Russian fi@@ ghter j@@ et - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scotland to dis@@ appear for customers outside Scotland
the br@@ and R@@ B@@ S is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chi@@ ef executive .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scotland will dis@@ appear for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ os@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan told B@@ B@@ C Scotland that the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has re@@ treated from them since it nearly collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be ba@@ iled out .
during that time , br@@ and stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists have used &apos; R@@ B@@ S &apos; to protect other consumer finance b@@ ran@@ ds .
it was backed with millions of p@@ ounds in spon@@ sor@@ ship of international sport , from S@@ i@@ x Nations ru@@ g@@ by to W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ on cha@@ mp@@ ion And@@ y M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y .
but now , it has been jud@@ ged right to let more national b@@ ran@@ ds come to the fore .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scotland will be used with Scot@@ t@@ ish customers , but will not be initi@@ alised .
in England and Wal@@ es , all R@@ B@@ S references , outside head office and the stock exchange lis@@ ting , will be changed to N@@ at@@ West .
the U@@ l@@ s@@ ter Bank br@@ and is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller b@@ ran@@ ds for private banking , which will get more pro@@ min@@ ence - C@@ out@@ ts , Ad@@ am &amp; C@@ o , D@@ r@@ um@@ mon@@ d , and Hol@@ t &apos;s M@@ ili@@ tary Bank .
Mr Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a t@@ our of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ sh@@ ire .
he told B@@ B@@ C Scotland : &quot; the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and will end up becoming our inves@@ tor br@@ and and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of b@@ ran@@ ds . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global br@@ and , R@@ B@@ S became the global br@@ and .
I &apos;@@ m now saying we no longer have global aspi@@ rations , we have local aspi@@ rations .
each one of those b@@ ran@@ ds will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those b@@ ran@@ ds .
R@@ B@@ S had already stated that it would not to continue its S@@ i@@ x Nations spon@@ sor@@ ship , and it has been raising the profile of different b@@ ran@@ ds in its sports spon@@ sor@@ ship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of b@@ ran@@ ds , because under@@ ne@@ ath ( we &apos;@@ ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chi@@ ef executive .
it would have been very c@@ yn@@ ical three years ago if we &apos;@@ d said we &apos;@@ re going to be a great bank for customers and put those b@@ ran@@ ds out there .
but with the work we &apos;@@ ve been doing , foc@@ us@@ sing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you &apos;@@ re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those b@@ ran@@ ds back up again , so I think the time is right .

J@@ oc@@ key Fran@@ ki@@ e D@@ et@@ tor@@ i secu@@ red his 3@@ ,@@ 000@@ th British w@@ inner at Ne@@ w@@ market on Friday .
he brought up the land@@ mark with his second w@@ inner of the night at his local track - on pre@@ d@@ il@@ ec@@ tion , trained by Joh@@ n G@@ os@@ den .
the 4@@ 5@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ c@@ key to reach the land@@ mark in F@@ l@@ at rac@@ ing .
he follows S@@ ir G@@ ord@@ on R@@ ic@@ har@@ ds , D@@ ou@@ g S@@ mit@@ h , L@@ es@@ ter P@@ ig@@ g@@ ot@@ t , P@@ at E@@ d@@ der@@ y and W@@ illi@@ e Car@@ son .

I &apos;@@ m very emo@@ tional because my family are here as well
I &apos;@@ m very pleased for it to have happened at Ne@@ w@@ market because this is where I lan@@ ded 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a Ro@@ y@@ al As@@ co@@ t - it &apos;s a mun@@ d@@ an@@ e Friday night with 20@@ ,@@ 000 people .
I &apos;@@ m reli@@ ev@@ ed and very hu@@ m@@ ble .
D@@ et@@ tor@@ i so@@ a@@ ks up the che@@ ers as he brings in pre@@ d@@ il@@ ec@@ tion after victory
two jo@@ c@@ ke@@ ys have reached the mil@@ es@@ tone in j@@ um@@ p rac@@ ing - cha@@ mp@@ ion jo@@ c@@ key R@@ ic@@ hard Joh@@ n@@ son and reti@@ red 20@@ -@@ time cha@@ mp@@ ion S@@ ir An@@ th@@ ony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who had more than 4@@ ,@@ 300 vic@@ tor@@ ies in a record@@ -@@ breaking career .
L@@ es@@ ter P@@ ig@@ g@@ ot@@ t , n@@ ine@@ -@@ time D@@ er@@ by w@@ inner , 4@@ ,@@ 4@@ 93 career w@@ ins
Fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best jo@@ c@@ ke@@ ys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this land@@ mark so few have achieved before him .
he is sty@@ lish and strong , but it is his tac@@ tical n@@ ous that sets him apart from others in the w@@ eigh@@ ing room .
he is a fan@@ tas@@ tic amb@@ assa@@ dor for rac@@ ing , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma have been drawing f@@ ans to the sport for years .
I said to Fran@@ ki@@ e a few weeks ago at E@@ p@@ so@@ m he &apos;@@ d have rid@@ den 6@@ ,@@ 000 w@@ inn@@ ers if he was@@ n &apos;@@ t just a weekend and big@@ -@@ race jo@@ c@@ key !
seriously though , Fran@@ ki@@ e &apos;s been rid@@ ing w@@ inn@@ ers in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a li@@ vely character which is good for British rac@@ ing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredi@@ ble jo@@ c@@ key .
Fran@@ ki@@ e D@@ et@@ tor@@ i celeb@@ rated the mil@@ es@@ tone with a tra@@ dem@@ ar@@ k f@@ lying dis@@ moun@@ t
from f@@ lying fin@@ is@@ hes to f@@ lying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Fran@@ ki@@ e D@@ et@@ tor@@ i has been the pos@@ ter bo@@ y of British F@@ l@@ at rac@@ ing for two decades .
it has been a ro@@ ll@@ er@@ coas@@ ter r@@ ide .
Sta@@ cks of big@@ -@@ race w@@ inn@@ ers , including his famous 1996 &apos; mag@@ nific@@ ent S@@ even &apos; at As@@ co@@ t , but he also survi@@ ved a plan@@ e cr@@ as@@ h and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially strugg@@ led when returning from that si@@ x@@ -@@ month sus@@ pension , but he showed form@@ id@@ able strength of character to def@@ y the doub@@ ters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - D@@ et@@ tor@@ i has previously said he would like to carry on compet@@ ing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia &apos;s Putin sa@@ cks chi@@ ef of staff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ ov
Russian President V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir Putin has une@@ x@@ pec@@ tedly dis@@ missed his chi@@ ef of staff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ ov .
Mr I@@ van@@ ov has been part of Mr Putin &apos;s tr@@ us@@ ted inner circ@@ le for many years .
the 6@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in said that Mr Putin had &quot; dec@@ re@@ ed to reli@@ eve I@@ van@@ ov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
Mr I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ty since 20@@ 12 , An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o , has been appointed as his success@@ or .
Mr V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Es@@ ton@@ ian capital T@@ all@@ in@@ n in 197@@ 2 , he gradu@@ ated from the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Mos@@ cow State In@@ stitute of International R@@ el@@ ations ( M@@ G@@ I@@ MO ) and served in the To@@ ky@@ o emb@@ ass@@ y .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in web@@ site says ( in Russian ) .
on being appointed , he told Mr Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instruc@@ tions are implemented .
Mr Putin told a Russian T@@ V sta@@ tion on Friday that Mr I@@ van@@ ov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that Mr V@@ ain@@ o should replace him .
do the s@@ mil@@ es convince ?
this is a move that has m@@ ys@@ ti@@ fied Mos@@ cow .
Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ ov has long been one of V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir Putin &apos;s clos@@ est allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the K@@ G@@ B .
as chi@@ ef of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chi@@ ef of staff was ste@@ pping down at his own request .
but despite the s@@ mil@@ es for the ca@@ mer@@ as , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the f@@ all@@ -@@ out from some kind of power struggle ?
No@@ -@@ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run Russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in remarks to Mr Putin , quo@@ ted on the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in web@@ site , Mr I@@ van@@ ov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 20@@ 12 I asked you , in a conver@@ sa@@ tion , to entr@@ ust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - tro@@ ub@@ les@@ ome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that I &apos;@@ ve been presidential chi@@ ef of staff for four years and eight months .
Mr I@@ van@@ ov took up the post in December 20@@ 11 .
he served previously as a de@@ pu@@ ty prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the K@@ G@@ B state security service , like Mr Putin .
in the late 199@@ 0s , when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Ser@@ vice ( F@@ S@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ G@@ B , Mr I@@ van@@ ov was appointed as his de@@ pu@@ ty .
when Mr Putin came to power , he na@@ med Mr I@@ van@@ ov as one of the five people he tr@@ us@@ ted most .
it was once thought that Mr I@@ van@@ ov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for Mr Putin would have been un@@ constitutional .
but that post was taken by another close Putin ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ved@@ e@@ v .
Mr Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just thre@@ e@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years later .
criminal minds sta@@ r Th@@ om@@ as Gi@@ b@@ son sa@@ cked after h@@ it@@ ting producer
Gi@@ b@@ son was involved in a physical alter@@ cation on the set of the show in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es last month .
A@@ B@@ C stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision stu@@ di@@ os , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al in a joint statement .
Gi@@ b@@ son , who played Special Ag@@ ent A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ot@@ ch@@ ner , issued an apolog@@ y on Thursday before his termin@@ ation was announced .
there were cre@@ ative differences on the set and a dis@@ agreement .
I regret that it occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how Gi@@ b@@ son &apos;s character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of F@@ B@@ I agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the A@@ B@@ C stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision stu@@ di@@ os statement .
the 5@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old , who previously star@@ red on the sit@@ co@@ m D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , had been on the show since its first se@@ as@@ on in 2005 .
&quot; I lo@@ ve Criminal minds and have put my heart and sou@@ l into it for the last twelve years , &quot; Gi@@ b@@ son said in a statement released on Friday .
I had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won &apos;@@ t be possible now .
I would just like to say thank you to the w@@ ri@@ ters , producers , actors , our ama@@ z@@ ing cre@@ w , and , most importantly , the best f@@ ans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is s@@ lated to return for its t@@ wel@@ f@@ th se@@ as@@ on on 28 September .

Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing : brid@@ ge now connected to Fif@@ e
the £ 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 20@@ 17
engine@@ ers have joined the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing &apos;s north dec@@ k and vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t - meaning the brid@@ ge is now connected to Fif@@ e .
it is the first of four clos@@ ures between the &quot; dec@@ k f@@ ans , &quot; which are now ne@@ aring completion around each of the brid@@ ge &apos;s three to@@ w@@ ers .
the brid@@ ge section from Fif@@ e is now 600 met@@ res long and w@@ eigh@@ s 30@@ ,@@ 000 tonnes .
it has 10@@ ,@@ 000 tonnes of steel and 20@@ ,@@ 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 sta@@ y@@ -@@ c@@ ab@@ les .
the £ 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 20@@ 17 .
economy Secretary K@@ e@@ it@@ h Bro@@ wn visited the site today and was among the first to w@@ al@@ k from the land on to the brid@@ ge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbol@@ ic moment in the building of the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing .
we &apos;@@ re all witn@@ essing engine@@ ering on a truly ep@@ ic scale on this project , with over 30@@ ,@@ 000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the brid@@ ge .
despite the massive size and weight of the brid@@ ge compl@@ eting the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and brid@@ ge dec@@ k is a delicate operation involving extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total brid@@ ge dec@@ k is now in place , the final section of dec@@ k is having its concrete dec@@ k cast in R@@ os@@ yt@@ h today , meaning all the dec@@ k is ready to be lif@@ ted into place on the brid@@ ge .
Mic@@ ha@@ el Mar@@ tin , forth C@@ ros@@ sing Br@@ id@@ ge construc@@ tors project direc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure on any brid@@ ge project is always a significant mil@@ es@@ tone .
on this fan@@ tas@@ tic project , this closure represents leading ed@@ ge civil engine@@ ering .
after install@@ ing the last road dec@@ k section and connec@@ ting it to the expan@@ ding North T@@ ow@@ er road dec@@ k , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side .
this was done by pu@@ lling the northern approach vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 700 mill@@ im@@ et@@ res sou@@ th@@ wards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t is 2@@ 22 met@@ res long , w@@ eigh@@ s approximately 6@@ ,@@ 000 tonnes and had to be pull@@ ed up a gra@@ di@@ ent of about 3 % .
delicate because the toler@@ ances the team were working to were tiny - just a few mill@@ im@@ et@@ res either way .
happ@@ ily , it all went very well .
Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay res@@ c@@ ue : three men are &apos; lu@@ ck@@ y to be al@@ iv@@ e@@ &apos;

Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ L@@ I li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at sta@@ tion raised the al@@ arm at 13 : 20 B@@ S@@ T on Friday after a cre@@ w saw the incident un@@ f@@ old in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay .
the three men strugg@@ led to s@@ wi@@ m to safety while their bo@@ at continued under its own power .
&quot; we saw their bo@@ at cir@@ cl@@ ing close to them and imag@@ ined the worst , &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at hel@@ m V@@ in@@ ce J@@ ones .
&quot; fortunately , by the time we had launched , the strong win@@ ds had blo@@ wn it clear of them , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing bo@@ at , while the third man , aged 60 , was found exhaus@@ ted and cl@@ inging to a bu@@ o@@ y without a li@@ fe@@ j@@ ac@@ ket .
they were all taken on board the in@@ shor@@ e li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at and brought back to the li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at sta@@ tion
Mr J@@ ones said : &quot; the three men thro@@ wn in the water are lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve and completely un@@ in@@ ju@@ red .

P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o a worthy hun@@ t for health and happ@@ iness
it is fas@@ cin@@ ating to see how the world turns .
that te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and children do not get outside to play any more , prefer@@ ring to spend their free time looking at scre@@ ens , has been the la@@ ment of many for the the past decade .
Po@@ k@@ em@@ on G@@ o is getting people off the cou@@ ch and into some activity .
scre@@ en time was initially limited to the television then v@@ ide@@ o g@@ ames and more recently s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es .
so it is great to see that technology and being active out@@ doors are not mu@@ tually exclusive .
I am of course referring to the cra@@ ze that is P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o , an A@@ P@@ P based on the char@@ ac@@ ters first created for v@@ ide@@ o g@@ ames in the 199@@ 0s ( it later spa@@ w@@ ned a car@@ to@@ on series , playing cards and other sp@@ in off@@ s ) .
like many po@@ p cultural phen@@ om@@ ena it had gone off the bo@@ il somewhat before this new game was made available in the US , Austr@@ alia and New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in early July .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which over@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed ser@@ vers .
within days , P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o had more users than T@@ ind@@ er and nearly as many as T@@ wit@@ ter .
so how does it work ?
in a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , players on s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es go out looking for P@@ ok@@ é@@ mon@@ s , which are trac@@ ked with a G@@ P@@ S and , once found , can be &apos; p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed &apos; ( via a scre@@ ens@@ ho@@ t on your ph@@ one ) or &apos; cap@@ tured &apos; .
a generation who played the game when youn@@ ger have joined the cra@@ ze , ju@@ mping off the cou@@ ch for the search .
in the US , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
Car@@ dio@@ gra@@ m , an A@@ P@@ P for the app@@ le Wat@@ ch that trac@@ ks 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 users , told the Washington P@@ ost recently that within two days of the game laun@@ ching , the number of people it trac@@ ked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day ju@@ mp@@ ed from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the cou@@ ch &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; have fallen on dea@@ f e@@ ars because most public health messages are bor@@ ing and delivered by people who look mis@@ er@@ able .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be under@@ stated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chan@@ ces of getting cancer or de@@ pression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the be@@ au@@ ty of P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sun@@ sh@@ ine , and fu@@ n .
some people are even making new friends on the hun@@ t .
as usual there are po@@ -@@ faced kill@@ jo@@ ys looking for something to compla@@ in about .
and yes some@@ body might w@@ al@@ k into a door .
so what ?
a break@@ through has occurred .
for while s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one app@@ s like F@@ it@@ bit could previously track our activity , they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the no@@ vel@@ ty will we@@ ar off and use will sub@@ side in due course .
however because of P@@ ok@@ me@@ on &apos;s success there will be more g@@ ames that combine app@@ s and vir@@ tual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hun@@ t to be more active , f@@ itte@@ r and heal@@ thi@@ er .

and now , finally , an Olymp@@ ic cha@@ mp@@ ion .
the 19@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old American g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast so@@ ared to the all@@ -@@ around title on Thursday , putting the gap between her@@ self and the rest of the world on full dis@@ play under the Olymp@@ ic sp@@ ot@@ light .
her total of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was well clear of sil@@ ver med@@ alist and &quot; Fin@@ al Fi@@ ve &quot; te@@ am@@ ma@@ te A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and Russian br@@ on@@ ze med@@ alist A@@ li@@ ya M@@ usta@@ fin@@ a .
United States &apos; S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es per@@ forms on the balance be@@ am during the artis@@ tic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics women &apos;s individual all@@ -@@ around final at the 20@@ 16 Sum@@ mer Olymp@@ ics in Rio de J@@ an@@ eir@@ o , Bra@@ z@@ il , Thursday .
B@@ il@@ es became the fourth straight American woman to win the all@@ -@@ around title and fifth overall while c@@ em@@ enting her repu@@ tation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she bur@@ st into te@@ ars when her final total was pos@@ ted and her long jour@@ ney to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same le@@ ag@@ ue as on@@ ce@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ generation a@@ th@@ le@@ tes like Mic@@ ha@@ el P@@ helps who have taken their sports to new he@@ i@@ ghts :
B@@ il@@ es has spent the last three years domin@@ ating her sport , w@@ inning 15 world cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship med@@ als - including 10 g@@ old - with rou@@ tin@@ es so as@@ ton@@ ishing in their mi@@ x of ambition and prec@@ ision that 198@@ 4 Olymp@@ ic cha@@ mp@@ ion M@@ ary L@@ ou R@@ et@@ ton called her &quot; the greatest g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast I &apos;@@ ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test a@@ wa@@ ited in Bra@@ z@@ il , a con@@ test not so much between B@@ il@@ es and the rest of the field but between her@@ self and the burden of over@@ sized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in S@@ pring , T@@ ex@@ as , with a fis@@ t@@ ful of g@@ ol@@ ds would be seen as a disappointment .
United States &apos; S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man emb@@ race after w@@ inning g@@ old and sil@@ ver respec@@ tively for the artis@@ tic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics women &apos;s individual all@@ -@@ around final at the 20@@ 16 Sum@@ mer Olymp@@ ics in Rio de J@@ an@@ eir@@ o , Bra@@ z@@ il , Thursday , A@@ u@@ g .
B@@ il@@ es ear@@ ned the first one on Tu@@ es@@ day while ser@@ ving as the exc@@ la@@ mation point to reti@@ ring national team coordin@@ ator Mar@@ th@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s going away party .
while B@@ il@@ es insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a por@@ tion of her floor exercise rou@@ tin@@ e - the one that includes her sig@@ nature tu@@ m@@ b@@ ling pass - is set to Latin musi@@ c that would fit right at home in the stre@@ et right outside the Rio Olymp@@ ic Ar@@ ena .
it &apos;s not a coinc@@ idence .
the g@@ ir@@ l adopted by her gran@@ d@@ parents as a tod@@ d@@ ler and discovered by co@@ ach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a field tri@@ p to the g@@ y@@ m where Bo@@ or@@ man was co@@ ac@@ hing has become a force .
she has@@ n &apos;@@ t lost an all@@ -@@ around competition since the summer of 20@@ 13 , a w@@ inning stre@@ a@@ k that should go for as long as B@@ il@@ es wants it to .
though M@@ usta@@ fin@@ a took a small lead through two ro@@ tations , it was a mi@@ ra@@ ge .
balance be@@ am and floor exercise - where B@@ il@@ es is the defending world cha@@ mp@@ ion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15@@ .@@ 4@@ 33 on be@@ am - and c@@ app@@ ed it with a 15@@ .@@ 9@@ 33 on floor .
R@@ ais@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her g@@ ently as they a@@ wa@@ ited the final sc@@ ore - a mere form@@ ality - and te@@ ars appeared around B@@ il@@ es &apos; gl@@ it@@ ter@@ y red , white and blu@@ e e@@ y@@ elin@@ er when the vision she once w@@ ro@@ te in a scrap@@ book became a reality .
R@@ ais@@ man &apos;s performance was a bit of reven@@ ge from four years ago , when she ti@@ ed for third but lost the br@@ on@@ ze to M@@ usta@@ fin@@ a on a ti@@ e@@ break@@ er .
this time , the 22@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old team cap@@ tain the Americans call &quot; gran@@ d@@ ma &quot; was well ahead .
she b@@ le@@ w k@@ is@@ ses to the cro@@ w@@ d after her floor exercise , overcome by a com@@ e@@ back that at times seemed in doubt .
as for B@@ il@@ es , the 19@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old &apos;s vi@@ ral tw@@ eet from earlier this week now car@@ ries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in ser@@ ial kill@@ er case sho@@ t while listening to musi@@ c in car
two women and a 12@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l who died in the dead@@ li@@ est attack in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x &apos;s first ser@@ ial kill@@ er case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to musi@@ c when they were sho@@ t , according to police reports released Thursday .
Ang@@ ela Ro@@ ch@@ ell@@ e lin@@ er , Ste@@ fan@@ i@@ e R@@ . E@@ ll@@ is and E@@ ll@@ is &apos; d@@ au@@ ghter Mal@@ e@@ ah were sho@@ t on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , authorities said .
the g@@ un@@ man fi@@ red as many as eight sho@@ ts from a hand@@ gun while standing on the passenger side of the car then f@@ led in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the tri@@ ple kill@@ ing do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t appear to have been the result of a ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y because the atta@@ ck@@ er d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t take pur@@ ses or $ 2@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 in the pos@@ session of one of the ad@@ ult victims .
P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x police spo@@ kes@@ man S@@ g@@ t@@ . J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ ow@@ ard said the sho@@ ot@@ ing promp@@ ted investig@@ ators to look at whether it was ti@@ ed to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others w@@ ounded in nine attacks in two pre@@ domin@@ antly H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods over a four@@ -@@ month period .
&quot; it &apos;s occurr@@ ing within a resid@@ ential area in front of a home , &quot; H@@ ow@@ ard said to C@@ B@@ S aff@@ ili@@ ate K@@ P@@ H@@ O earlier this month .
the sus@@ pect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a la@@ te@@ -@@ 199@@ 0s bro@@ wn N@@ iss@@ an , a la@@ te@@ -@@ 199@@ 0s black B@@ M@@ W and a white C@@ ad@@ ill@@ a@@ c or L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n .
investig@@ ators have dec@@ lined to reve@@ al the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same kill@@ er .
E@@ ll@@ is , 33 , was h@@ osp@@ ita@@ li@@ z@@ ed for her in@@ j@@ uri@@ es and later died .
lin@@ er , 31 , and E@@ ll@@ is &apos; d@@ au@@ ghter Mal@@ e@@ ah died at the sc@@ ene .
a witness told police that it was@@ n &apos;@@ t un@@ usual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car listening to musi@@ c .
authorities also released a police report on a sho@@ ot@@ ing that targeted an u@@ no@@ cc@@ u@@ pi@@ ed pic@@ k@@ u@@ p truc@@ k just a hal@@ f@@ -@@ hour before the tri@@ ple kill@@ ing and is believed to have been the work of the ser@@ ial kill@@ er .
investig@@ ators found bu@@ ll@@ et cas@@ ings and rec@@ over@@ ed a bu@@ ll@@ et from a seat and bu@@ ll@@ et frag@@ ments from the eng@@ ine com@@ part@@ ment .
mother of 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old with mic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , E@@ d@@ mun@@ d P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to lo@@ ves sing@@ ing , to@@ ys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his pe@@ ers , E@@ d@@ mun@@ d has mic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic dis@@ order his mo@@ m E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t know about while preg@@ nant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , I can &apos;@@ t do this .
I can &apos;@@ t do this .
I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -@@ - of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , V@@ inc@@ ent , were told E@@ d@@ mun@@ d might never rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as sugges@@ ting he be institution@@ ali@@ z@@ ed .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t think people did that an@@ y@@ more , &apos; &quot; P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained .
E@@ d@@ mun@@ d w@@ al@@ ks with the help of a Wal@@ ker .
E@@ d@@ mun@@ d d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t sit up or cra@@ w@@ l until he was three , and he still do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t talk .
but he &apos;s slowly meeting some mil@@ es@@ ton@@ es .
he &apos;s w@@ al@@ king with help , and rid@@ ing a b@@ ike .
he also lo@@ ves playing with his two bro@@ thers , and sing@@ ing .
E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h demonstrates the sign language E@@ d@@ mun@@ d made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;@@ re teac@@ hing him sign language , &quot; P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws .
but it &apos;s not just typical sign language -@@ - she says E@@ d@@ mun@@ d has inven@@ ted some of his own signs .
Mic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like E@@ d@@ mun@@ d &apos;s , and infec@@ tions during preg@@ nan@@ cy from vir@@ uses like me@@ as@@ les and Z@@ ika .
sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can vary widely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infec@@ ted with Z@@ ika .
P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emo@@ tional tol@@ l of an un@@ certain future .
I kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t really know .
I actually ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t asked for a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis in fore@@ ver , because I don &apos;@@ t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has hope@@ ful advice for the mo@@ thers of b@@ ab@@ ies with birth def@@ ec@@ ts from Z@@ ika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will lo@@ ve your child , and your child will lo@@ ve you .
heavy ra@@ in , flo@@ od@@ ing promp@@ ts res@@ cu@@ es in L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana , M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i
heavy ra@@ in and widespread flo@@ od@@ ing in L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana lead the govern@@ or to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more ra@@ in expected over the state through Sa@@ tur@@ day .
numerous ri@@ vers in sou@@ the@@ ast L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana and southern M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i were over@@ flo@@ wing their banks and threatening widespread flo@@ od@@ ing after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National wea@@ ther Ser@@ vice reported .
L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana Go@@ v@@ . Joh@@ n bel E@@ d@@ wards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected par@@ is@@ hes .
M@@ ike Ste@@ el@@ e , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Govern@@ or &apos;s Office of H@@ om@@ el@@ and Security and E@@ mer@@ g@@ ency prepar@@ ed@@ ness , said requests were coming in for hi@@ gh@@ -@@ water vehicles , bo@@ ats and san@@ d@@ b@@ ag@@ s .
Ste@@ el@@ e said T@@ an@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish alone requested tens of thousands of san@@ d@@ b@@ ag@@ s .
a flo@@ od watch remains in effect until Sa@@ tur@@ day across most of south L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana .
the wea@@ ther service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 in@@ ches could fall over the area .
in south A@@ lab@@ ama , a flo@@ od watch was in effect Friday as ra@@ in continued in the M@@ ob@@ ile area .
the Com@@ ite R@@ iver near b@@ aton R@@ ou@@ ge and Am@@ ite R@@ iver near D@@ en@@ ha@@ m s@@ pr@@ ings , both in L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana , were predic@@ ted to set record c@@ res@@ ts over the weekend .
F@@ o@@ rec@@ as@@ ter A@@ le@@ k K@@ ra@@ u@@ t@@ mann said both ri@@ vers could flo@@ od many houses in sub@@ urban areas near b@@ aton R@@ ou@@ ge .
he also said that flo@@ od@@ ing down@@ stre@@ am in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a threat , as those sw@@ oll@@ en ri@@ vers will be slow to dra@@ in into La@@ ke M@@ au@@ re@@ p@@ as .
the T@@ ic@@ k@@ fa@@ w R@@ iver , just south of the M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i state line in Li@@ ver@@ po@@ ol , L@@ ou@@ isi@@ ana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.@@ m. Friday .
Res@@ cu@@ ers were still plu@@ cking people from flo@@ od@@ waters in Am@@ ite and W@@ il@@ k@@ ins@@ on coun@@ ties in sou@@ th@@ west M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ for@@ d , his wi@@ fe and ste@@ p@@ son were among those res@@ cu@@ ed earlier Friday near G@@ los@@ ter .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d , 62 , says waters from Be@@ a@@ ver cre@@ ek , which is normally more than 400 fe@@ et away from his house , ro@@ se quickly over@@ night .
he said another ste@@ p@@ son who lives ne@@ ar@@ by al@@ er@@ ted him .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water kept on coming , &quot; H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said .
it came up to my w@@ ais@@ t .
his wi@@ fe told H@@ ans@@ for@@ d that it &apos;s the highest she &apos;s seen the cre@@ ek in the 48 years she &apos;s li@@ ved there .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he &apos;s the only one who can s@@ wi@@ m .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said emergency workers res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large militar@@ y@@ -@@ sty@@ le truc@@ k and took them to the fire sta@@ tion in G@@ los@@ ter , where they were sh@@ el@@ tering Friday .
K@@ ra@@ u@@ t@@ mann says flo@@ od@@ ing is &quot; quickly becoming widespread &quot; as heavy ra@@ ins continue , saying officials are considering eva@@ c@@ uation orders .
K@@ ra@@ u@@ t@@ mann says one obser@@ ver near L@@ iv@@ ing@@ s@@ ton reported 13@@ .@@ 75 in@@ ches of ra@@ in from mid@@ night to Friday morning .
K@@ ra@@ u@@ t@@ mann said the ground was heavily sa@@ tu@@ rated by ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
heavy ra@@ in and stre@@ et flo@@ od@@ ing promp@@ ted the res@@ c@@ ue of resid@@ ents from their homes in T@@ an@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and the cancell@@ ation of classes in five school dis@@ tric@@ ts , authorities said .
C@@ B@@ S aff@@ ili@@ ate W@@ W@@ L reports that an al@@ der@@ woman in T@@ an@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a said 200 homes flo@@ od@@ ed .
resid@@ ents had been eva@@ cu@@ ated to two ch@@ ur@@ ches but both are now flo@@ od@@ ing .
Par@@ ish President Rob@@ by Mill@@ er said authorities res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven p@@ ets str@@ an@@ ded by high water .
sh@@ el@@ ters have been opened in the town of Am@@ ite and the city of H@@ am@@ mon@@ d to house those who were eva@@ cu@@ ated .
&quot; they will be allowed to return home once the water star@@ ts to rec@@ ede , &quot; he said .
in the T@@ an@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish city of H@@ am@@ mon@@ d , close to two do@@ zen stre@@ ets were closed because of high water , and san@@ d@@ b@@ ag@@ s were made available for pic@@ k@@ u@@ p by resid@@ ents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
&quot; the last major flo@@ od we had was in March , &quot; said city administra@@ tor L@@ acy L@@ and@@ ru@@ m .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i , Har@@ ris@@ on Coun@@ ty E@@ mer@@ g@@ ency manag@@ er Ru@@ per@@ t L@@ acy said stead@@ y ra@@ in continued on the G@@ ulf Co@@ ast .
he said a hand@@ ful of houses were reported as flo@@ od@@ ed Thursday , but none have been reported so far Friday .
K@@ e@@ it@@ h T@@ ow@@ n@@ son , manag@@ er of S@@ hop@@ per V@@ alu@@ e F@@ o@@ ods in Am@@ ite , has li@@ ved in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve seen water in some places I have never seen before , &quot; T@@ ow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming down . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Bro@@ wn , 6 , &quot; rid@@ d@@ led with bu@@ ll@@ ets , &quot; survi@@ ves P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia sho@@ ot@@ ing
police say a 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y has been sho@@ t in P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia , marking the second sho@@ ot@@ ing of a 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s gran@@ d@@ parents identified him to C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Bro@@ wn .
the gran@@ d@@ parents say Bro@@ wn suffered multi@@ ple g@@ un@@ sho@@ t w@@ ounds , including in his gro@@ in , le@@ g , arm and ab@@ d@@ om@@ en , but was a@@ wake when he was trans@@ ported to the h@@ osp@@ ital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was rid@@ d@@ led with bu@@ ll@@ ets , &quot; his gran@@ d@@ mother D@@ elo@@ res M@@ el@@ en@@ de@@ z tell@@ s the sta@@ tion .
I just can &apos;@@ t believe it .
the bo@@ y is listed in critical condition at a h@@ osp@@ ital and has under@@ gone several sur@@ ger@@ ies .
family tell@@ s the sta@@ tion he is expected to rec@@ over .
he was set to start first grade at a local el@@ ementary school .
Bro@@ wn was among four people sho@@ t in the Ger@@ man@@ town section .
also sho@@ t were three men : two 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds and one 3@@ 2@@ -@@ year old .
one of the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia .
the child was found sho@@ t in the front seat of a car along with the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old in critical condition , the sta@@ tion reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investig@@ ating whether any of the w@@ ounded men could be a sho@@ o@@ ter .
investig@@ ators tell@@ s C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia it appears there was cros@@ s@@ fire between multi@@ ple g@@ un@@ men .
assa@@ ult weap@@ on@@ -@@ sty@@ le sh@@ ell cas@@ ings , tra@@ ced to different assa@@ ult sty@@ le weapons , l@@ itte@@ red the sc@@ ene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were cas@@ ings in the stre@@ et , on both sides of the si@@ de@@ w@@ al@@ k .
so it appears that there were multi@@ ple armed comb@@ a@@ tants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia police C@@ ap@@ tain An@@ th@@ ony G@@ in@@ al@@ di told the sta@@ tion .
multi@@ ple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arres@@ ts have been made and police are re@@ porte@@ dly re@@ vie@@ wing surveillance v@@ ide@@ o .
another 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old , a g@@ ir@@ l , was hit in her arm by a stra@@ y bu@@ ll@@ et Tu@@ es@@ day while playing in front of her home in the West o@@ a@@ k lan@@ e neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
she is rec@@ over@@ ing , and police are still sear@@ ching for a sus@@ pect .
why we need S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e
that &apos;s what I call this year &apos;s Women &apos;s Olymp@@ ic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics T@@ e@@ am and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Sum@@ mer Olymp@@ ics since 198@@ 4 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts , S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s and La@@ ur@@ en &quot; L@@ au@@ ri@@ e &quot; Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , who have been ins@@ p@@ iring so many young girls of col@@ or .
the ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up of this team , round@@ ed out by A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , who is Je@@ wish , and Mad@@ ison Ko@@ ci@@ an , who is Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like America .
it also has sol@@ id@@ i@@ fied the black and Lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast has been Afric@@ an@@ -@@ American .
last year , S@@ im@@ one and G@@ ab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last Olymp@@ ics , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s was a surprise Olymp@@ ic cha@@ mp@@ ion , and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredi@@ ble per@@ for@@ man@@ ces of thre@@ e@@ -@@ time World cha@@ mp@@ ion S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z deliver@@ ing the une@@ x@@ pected , yet mas@@ ter@@ ful g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics rou@@ tin@@ es .
on Thursday , S@@ im@@ one became the fourth straight American to win g@@ old in the women &apos;s individual all@@ -@@ around event .
and te@@ am@@ ma@@ te A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man ear@@ ned sil@@ ver .
we are witn@@ essing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics classes across the country .
S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e all took the same path as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to make the Olymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; Fin@@ al Fi@@ ve &quot; because the next Olymp@@ ic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics team will only have four g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts on the team , and this is Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s last year co@@ ac@@ hing .
but the reality is that g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport , and g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts primarily train in private g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics clu@@ bs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uni@@ forms , competition fe@@ es , ho@@ te@@ l fe@@ es ( for the co@@ ac@@ hes and their g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics clu@@ bs are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent sub@@ urban neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods that can support the business .
these clu@@ bs are where the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a cos@@ tly and long@@ -@@ term commitment for the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts &apos; families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , co@@ ach of S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , and M@@ ag@@ gi@@ e H@@ an@@ e@@ y , co@@ ach of L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , have both co@@ ac@@ hed their a@@ th@@ le@@ tes since they started in g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics .
we must bring more affor@@ d@@ able and accessible g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics training to the communities of coun@@ tless young girls who are inspi@@ red by S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e .
I founded my g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
at my Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ations , we have provided free and low@@ -@@ cost g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics , based in Har@@ le@@ m , for over 15@@ ,@@ 000 urban youth ( primarily black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and have trained national and international cha@@ mp@@ ions .
in September , we will be expan@@ ding to D@@ et@@ ro@@ it ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to provide high quality g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olymp@@ ic sport .
g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics develop@@ s strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides li@@ fe@@ -@@ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .

j@@ uni@@ or doctors set to moun@@ t further strikes after rejecting J@@ er@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a re@@ formed contract with British Med@@ ical Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors who took part in a ball@@ ot had rejected it .
in July , Mr Hun@@ t revealed plans to impose the contract saying the N@@ H@@ S was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first j@@ uni@@ or doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to over@@ night and weekend working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hours .
D@@ r E@@ ll@@ en Mc@@ Court , the B@@ M@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; j@@ uni@@ or doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current work@@ force crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the B@@ M@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an un@@ willingness to engage and , at times , de@@ af@@ ening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from J@@ er@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; J@@ er@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , li@@ ft the im@@ position and address j@@ uni@@ or doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then j@@ uni@@ or doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of April saw the postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,@@ 000 rou@@ tin@@ e operations and 1@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 ap@@ poin@@ tments as nur@@ ses and consul@@ tants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the pic@@ ket line .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a re@@ formed contract with British Med@@ ical Association officials .
the B@@ M@@ A wants better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Dan@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ti@@ mer , chi@@ ef executive of N@@ H@@ S E@@ mp@@ lo@@ yers , called on j@@ uni@@ or doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
Mr Mor@@ ti@@ mer said : &quot; industrial action achiev@@ es little or nothing , but places pressure on already stre@@ t@@ ched teams and services and causes wor@@ ry , dist@@ ress and dis@@ ruption for patients , car@@ ers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the J@@ uni@@ or D@@ oc@@ tors Committee and have , along with the De@@ part@@ ment of Health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the Gu@@ ar@@ dian role and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wing .
employers were hope@@ ful that the continued positive eng@@ agement on other important topics - such as deplo@@ yment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us , study leave and the gender pay gap in medic@@ ine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the De@@ part@@ ment of Health were about hon@@ ouring the agreements reached with the B@@ M@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
An@@ ti@@ -@@ cl@@ ot@@ ting drug tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or s@@ las@@ hes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a s@@ tro@@ ke or another attack .
N@@ H@@ S wat@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g Nice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ dio@@ vas@@ c@@ ular problems .
but now N@@ H@@ S wat@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g Nice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ dio@@ vas@@ c@@ ular problems .
some 14@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 people have a heart attack in England every year , and a quar@@ ter of these go on to have another attack or a s@@ tro@@ ke .
heart attacks and s@@ tro@@ kes are caused by the buil@@ d@@ -@@ up of f@@ at@@ ty material in ar@@ ter@@ y w@@ all@@ s to form a pla@@ que .
if the pla@@ que breaks apart it can cause a blood c@@ lot , bloc@@ king blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the c@@ lot dis@@ lo@@ d@@ ges it can travel in the blood stre@@ am and block blood flow to the bra@@ in , causing a s@@ tro@@ ke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , which is made by UK firm A@@ stra@@ Z@@ en@@ ec@@ a and sold under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduc@@ es this risk by making c@@ lo@@ ts less likely .
the draft Nice guidance , published today , recom@@ mends that people be given 90 m@@ g of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or for 12 months , followed by 6@@ 0@@ m@@ g along with as@@ p@@ ir@@ in twice a day for another three years .
Pro@@ f@@ essor Car@@ ole L@@ ong@@ son , direc@@ tor at the Nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treat@@ ments , as many as a quar@@ ter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or s@@ tro@@ ke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , in combination with as@@ p@@ ir@@ in , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and s@@ tro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in prov@@ isi@@ on@@ ally recom@@ mending tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy and safety of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or - particularly the risk of b@@ le@@ eding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
P@@ C culture let vote fraud in Mus@@ li@@ m areas f@@ lou@@ rish
Ex@@ -@@ T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets may@@ or L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man was removed from office last year for corruption , promp@@ ting the government report
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Mus@@ li@@ m communities , a devastating government report reve@@ als today .
Ex@@ -@@ C@@ ab@@ in@@ et minister S@@ ir E@@ ric P@@ ic@@ kl@@ es lam@@ bas@@ ts the police , election wat@@ c@@ hd@@ og@@ s and town hall@@ s for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over@@ -@@ sensiti@@ v@@ ities about eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secre@@ tary , now the anti@@ -@@ corruption t@@ sa@@ r , said the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put c@@ ord@@ ons outside p@@ oll@@ ing stations to protect fri@@ gh@@ tened voters .
he recom@@ mends that voters should have to take I@@ D to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a vo@@ ter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting ind@@ eli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fin@@ g@@ ers as they cast their ball@@ ot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers , S@@ ir E@@ ric says .
he calls for the P@@ ress to be given greater access to coun@@ cil papers and decisions taken by u@@ no@@ ffici@@ al committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ord@@ ered by D@@ ow@@ ning S@@ tre@@ et in the wake of the T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets voting scandal in East London .
last year a special election court rul@@ ed the sitting may@@ or , L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man , should be removed from office following a li@@ tan@@ y of cor@@ rupt and illegal practices .
the court found R@@ ah@@ man &quot; c@@ yn@@ ically per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; the religious feeling of his Mus@@ li@@ m community and sil@@ enc@@ ed his critic@@ s with accus@@ ations of racism and Isla@@ m@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
R@@ ah@@ man , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful Mus@@ lim@@ s to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were du@@ b@@ ious or the result of person@@ ation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
S@@ ir E@@ ric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he vo@@ ic@@ ed particular al@@ arm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Mus@@ li@@ m community were said to have exer@@ ted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their cho@@ os@@ ing .
S@@ ir E@@ ric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your I@@ D to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the el@@ ders , especially in communities of P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ i and Banglades@@ h@@ i background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ -@@ sensiti@@ v@@ ities about eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
S@@ ir E@@ ric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political acti@@ vis@@ ts from handling postal ball@@ ot papers to stop &quot; vote har@@ ves@@ ting . &quot;
the report , being considered by T@@ her@@ es@@ a May , also calls for tou@@ gh@@ er checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce I@@ D before voting .
use ind@@ eli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fin@@ g@@ ers once they cast their ball@@ ot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a thre@@ e@@ -@@ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaig@@ ners and acti@@ vis@@ ts from handling completed postal votes and postal vote en@@ vel@@ op@@ es .
give police powers to set up c@@ ord@@ ons around p@@ oll@@ ing stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with inti@@ mid@@ ation under the R@@ ep@@ res@@ entation of the People Act 198@@ 3 .
make it illegal to take pic@@ tures in p@@ oll@@ ing stations .
make it a requirement that only English is to be used in p@@ oll@@ ing stations ( except in Wal@@ es ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the bo@@ oth alone .
S@@ ir E@@ ric sa@@ va@@ ges the M@@ et@@ ro@@ pol@@ ita@@ n Pol@@ ice , saying it is &quot; as@@ ton@@ ishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets case .
&quot; the election court dis@@ qualified L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man and his ag@@ ent for a li@@ tan@@ y of cor@@ rupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also critic@@ ises the ineffec@@ tual &quot; tic@@ k@@ -@@ bo@@ x inspections &quot; of town h@@ all electoral registration departments .
S@@ ir E@@ ric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets was a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and state of den@@ ial by some bodies threa@@ tens that good repu@@ tation .

to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , pe@@ el@@ ed them off and put them back on the sh@@ elf .
she carried on bro@@ w@@ sing and eventually tried on four pa@@ irs of under@@ we@@ ar at the stor@@ e in Bou@@ veri@@ e place sh@@ opp@@ ing centre , F@@ ol@@ kes@@ tone .
the P@@ r@@ im@@ ar@@ k stor@@ e in Bou@@ veri@@ e place sh@@ opp@@ ing centre , F@@ ol@@ kes@@ tone , where the woman tried on k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers before putting them back on the sh@@ elf
a mo@@ ther@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two , J@@ enn@@ y D@@ av@@ id@@ son , who was in the sho@@ p at the time , said after trying on the under@@ we@@ ar the m@@ ys@@ ter@@ y woman &apos; got d@@ res@@ sed again and w@@ al@@ ked out of the stor@@ e without bu@@ ying anything . &apos;
she said : &apos; people cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t believe what they were seeing . &apos;
standing in the middle of the sho@@ p floor , she took a pair of k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers from the dis@@ play , stri@@ pped off her own ti@@ ghts and pan@@ ts and put them on .

how to defend yourself from gun attacks using K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this v@@ ide@@ o from Da@@ il@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ .@@ co@@ m might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to R@@ h@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i , New Y@@ or@@ k@@ -@@ based gran@@ d@@ mas@@ ter of the K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a Federation , to find out how to deal with g@@ un@@ -@@ to@@ ting mu@@ gg@@ ers at close range .
whether you &apos;@@ re approac@@ hed from in front or behind , this v@@ ide@@ o will show you how to turn the tables on your mu@@ gg@@ er .
if approac@@ hed from behind , M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your atta@@ ck@@ er and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then gras@@ p the gun between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before h@@ it@@ ting them in the face with your free el@@ b@@ ow .
a k@@ ne@@ e to the gro@@ in follows , and while the atta@@ ck@@ er doub@@ les up in pain , you tw@@ ist the gun from his hands , s@@ ma@@ ck him in the face with the bar@@ re@@ l and back up , keeping the weap@@ on trained on him .
for g@@ un@@ men approac@@ hing from the front , it &apos;s a similar techni@@ que - get your body out of the line of fire , gra@@ b the gun and tw@@ ist it around so the vill@@ ain can &apos;@@ t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and pun@@ ch the atta@@ ck@@ er in the ch@@ est , then tw@@ ist the gun from his gri@@ p before backing up and pointing it at him .
s@@ ounds tric@@ ky ?
check the v@@ ide@@ o to see exactly how M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i does it .
but remember that the saf@@ est way out of any mu@@ gging - if you &apos;@@ re not a K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a gran@@ d@@ mas@@ ter - is to hand over your cas@@ h .

all the way along his tri@@ p through Europe , Mr W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical profession@@ als about bo@@ os@@ ting g@@ ut bac@@ teri@@ a and about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he lic@@ ked left him with anything more than a bad tas@@ te in his mouth .
Mr W@@ right became known for testing the dura@@ bility of his g@@ ut by travelling around the world and e@@ ating we@@ ir@@ d and wonderful things .
from public han@@ dra@@ ils in train stations to a to@@ il@@ et f@@ l@@ us@@ h bu@@ t@@ ton the task definitely tested his im@@ mu@@ ne system
in the mo@@ vi@@ e made about it he said : &apos; ever since I was a ki@@ d I have been fairly care@@ free with my health and I &apos;@@ ve put all sor@@ ts of things in my mouth from soil , e@@ ating wor@@ ms and mu@@ d@@ dy water . &apos;
he certainly proved his repu@@ tation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a fil@@ thy Russian public to@@ il@@ et .
his sa@@ mp@@ le s@@ wa@@ b showed a lu@@ min@@ om@@ e@@ ter count of over 4@@ 000 units .
by comparison , f@@ res@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one Russian public to@@ il@@ et he refused to lic@@ k after his lu@@ min@@ om@@ e@@ ter count was over 4@@ 000 units , when f@@ res@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed hands are less than 60
Mr W@@ right and Finn@@ ish da@@ iry producer V@@ ali@@ o have produced the trav@@ ell@@ er &apos;s film called The L@@ ic@@ k@@ h@@ ik@@ er &apos;s Gu@@ ide to I@@ n@@ n@@ er S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th which shows the bac@@ teri@@ a count in different place like in the ba@@ th@@ room
he said in the film : &apos; that is close to one of the worst things I have sm@@ elled in a to@@ il@@ et . &apos;
there &apos;s nothing more di@@ r@@ ty than that !
I &apos;@@ m not going to lic@@ k anything because it &apos;s dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting in there .
the L@@ ic@@ k@@ h@@ ik@@ er &apos;s Gu@@ ide to I@@ n@@ n@@ er S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th was produced in conjunction with Finn@@ ish da@@ iry producer V@@ ali@@ o .
the company provided Mr W@@ right with V@@ ali@@ o G@@ ef@@ il@@ us , which contain la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a as well as vi@@ tamin@@ s C and D to help boost people &apos;s g@@ ut bac@@ teri@@ a and im@@ mu@@ ne systems .
V@@ ali@@ o &apos;s S@@ eni@@ or Vice President of s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks , Ju@@ ice and New Ca@@ teg@@ or@@ ies N@@ ik@@ o V@@ u@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fas@@ cin@@ ating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of prob@@ io@@ tics .
we did a lot of cra@@ z@@ y bra@@ ins@@ tor@@ ming that ended in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call I@@ an . &quot;
they claim the interest in g@@ ut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a big@@ ger context - the good and bad bac@@ teri@@ a in our everyday environment , the importance of g@@ ut health and how it &apos;s linked to the im@@ mu@@ ne system .
growing interest in g@@ ut health is a global phenomenon and with the docu@@ mentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of hu@@ m@@ our !
T@@ om Ha@@ k@@ al@@ a , who directed the film , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - I would have lost my respect for I@@ an if he had lic@@ ked some of the things I asked him to , like the dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting Russian to@@ il@@ et that &apos;s shown in the film . &apos;
naturally some things were easier to get I@@ an to lic@@ k , some were pre@@ tty tough .
I &apos;@@ m glad we got some of those di@@ r@@ ty lic@@ ks caught on ta@@ pe . &apos;
in a surve@@ y conducted in 2015 by V@@ ali@@ o , 84 per cent of the respon@@ d@@ ents associated la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a specifically with the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the s@@ tom@@ ach and g@@ ut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasi@@ on@@ ally products containing added la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a .
family of yo@@ bs destroyed Sal@@ tas@@ h , Cor@@ n@@ wall coun@@ cil house ahead of ev@@ ic@@ tion
a family of yo@@ bs left their coun@@ cil house with £ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ ing their neighbours .
T@@ an@@ y@@ a S@@ kel@@ don and her partner S@@ ha@@ un Tre@@ bil@@ co@@ ck have been k@@ ic@@ ked out of the property in Sal@@ tas@@ h , Cor@@ n@@ wall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the property , sho@@ cked hous@@ ing associations officers found the property in a state of dis@@ re@@ pair .
the w@@ all@@ s were left with g@@ ap@@ ing hol@@ es , flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ards were ri@@ pped up , ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was stre@@ wn over the floor and gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i was d@@ au@@ bed on the w@@ all@@ s .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private ac@@ com@@ od@@ ation
D@@ onn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , hous@@ ing manag@@ er at Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ous@@ ing , said she fe@@ ared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are for people down here and I don &apos;@@ t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to wei@@ gh up because this property will probably be known by the no@@ t@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ n@@ ice element of Cor@@ n@@ wall .
this family are no@@ tor@@ ious and their name is no@@ tor@@ ious .
the couple had three s@@ ons who li@@ ved at the property inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ tly and police say the re@@ ign of terror the family inf@@ lic@@ ted included fighting in the stre@@ et with b@@ ase@@ ball b@@ ats , inti@@ mid@@ ating ne@@ ar@@ by resid@@ ents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive sh@@ ou@@ ting , argu@@ ing and s@@ we@@ aring .
S@@ kel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the ten@@ an@@ cy , was given an an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour order in June .
old ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was found in a number of the ro@@ oms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished
floor bo@@ ards had been pull@@ ed up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the stre@@ et and police were regularly called
Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ous@@ ing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her partner for@@ ce@@ fully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the ev@@ ic@@ tion was ha@@ iled by reli@@ ev@@ ed neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hel@@ l .
one said : &apos; they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t care about anybody . &apos;
we li@@ ved next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;@@ ve seen the police down here is un@@ beli@@ eva@@ ble .
&apos;@@ T@@ his morning , we cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t s@@ le@@ ep . &apos;
we got up because it was so qui@@ et here - we &apos;@@ re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lo@@ vely now that they &apos;@@ re finally gone .
Ad@@ am F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ous@@ ing &apos;s neighbour@@ ho@@ od enforcement manag@@ er , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have li@@ ved in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish and old to@@ ys have been thro@@ wn down the over@@ grown side of the coun@@ cil house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as ev@@ ic@@ tion is always the last course of action that Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ous@@ ing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terri@@ fying for her neighbours to witness .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice and members of the community who bra@@ vely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some comfor@@ t to the neighbours and sen@@ ds out a message that an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
Mr F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k said that the three s@@ ons had all li@@ ved at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s .
a di@@ r@@ ty mat@@ t@@ ress left on the floor of one of the b@@ ed@@ ro@@ oms in the house after the ev@@ ic@@ tion
hous@@ ing workers will now have to clear away the pil@@ es of ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish which sur@@ round the house
in 20@@ 14 , police ra@@ id@@ ed the property and found more than 7@@ 0@@ g in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is as well as sc@@ al@@ es , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and £ 1@@ ,@@ 700 in cas@@ h .
S@@ kel@@ don was fin@@ ed after ple@@ ading guilty to pos@@ session of a C@@ las@@ s B drug with inten@@ t to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a head@@ stone for her son , L@@ ee S@@ kel@@ don , who died in a car cr@@ as@@ h in 20@@ 13 .
after being made hom@@ eless , it is understood that T@@ an@@ y@@ a and her partner are now living in private hous@@ ing in P@@ l@@ y@@ mouth .
the w@@ all@@ s of many of the house &apos;s ro@@ oms had gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i sc@@ ra@@ w@@ led across them .
police say they will seek to ev@@ ic@@ t ten@@ ants who f@@ l@@ out the rules of their ten@@ an@@ cies
Ang@@ ela c@@ row , of D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice , said the ev@@ ic@@ tion sent a clear warning to other ten@@ ants who continue to f@@ l@@ out the rules .
&apos;@@ T@@ his sen@@ ds out to those who feel that they can be@@ have without rec@@ r@@ imin@@ ation , as well as those b@@ li@@ ghted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour will never be toler@@ ated by D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
touris@@ ts in Portugal are left terri@@ fied as a low@@ -@@ f@@ lying military j@@ et f@@ lies s@@ k@@ im@@ s be@@ ach
touris@@ ts su@@ n wor@@ shipping in A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o , Portugal , had the sho@@ ck of their lives
a Portuguese air force P@@ -@@ 3@@ C O@@ ri@@ on plan@@ e sw@@ o@@ op@@ ed in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terri@@ fied touris@@ ts start to pan@@ ic as a low@@ -@@ f@@ lying j@@ et sw@@ o@@ op@@ ed down over a pac@@ ked be@@ ach .
dramatic fo@@ o@@ tage showed the military plan@@ e almost coming within tou@@ ching distance of sun@@ seekers on the stre@@ t@@ ch of sand in A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o , northern Portugal .
holid@@ a@@ y@@ makers ro@@ se to their fe@@ et as they became understand@@ ably concerned about the noise from the j@@ et eng@@ ines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
the incident happened in Costa No@@ va near A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o yesterday afternoon .
Dan@@ i@@ el Fer@@ nan@@ des , one of several holid@@ a@@ y@@ makers who pos@@ ted v@@ ide@@ os of the dramatic f@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ by onto social media , said : &apos; it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to cr@@ as@@ h . &apos;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &apos; I was sur@@ f@@ ing and s@@ we@@ ar it felt like the plan@@ e was going to fall on top of me . &apos;
touris@@ ts on the be@@ ach at A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o were terri@@ fied when the plan@@ e appeared out of the mur@@ k and fle@@ w at an incredibly low al@@ titude
the Portuguese A@@ ir For@@ ce said today the pilot of the P@@ -@@ 3@@ C O@@ ri@@ on plan@@ e was on a training flight to identify fishing bo@@ ats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of chec@@ king them .
he said the j@@ et had flo@@ wn slightly lower than normal because of poor visi@@ bility caused by the smo@@ ke from ne@@ ar@@ by w@@ il@@ d@@ fires , but the air force insisted no@@ -@@ one &apos;s safety had been compromis@@ ed .
W@@ il@@ d@@ fires have devasta@@ ted parts of main@@ land Portugal this summer as well as kill@@ ing four people on the island of Mad@@ eira .
the Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to f@@ ly low because of the conditions - th@@ ick fo@@ g and smo@@ ke from w@@ il@@ d@@ fires - which ob@@ sc@@ u@@ red his visi@@ bility
the plan@@ e was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing bo@@ ats as part of the exercise
E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e &apos;s result during the first half of the year better than expected
the South Kar@@ el@@ ia Social and Health C@@ are Dis@@ tric@@ t ( E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e ) made a result that was 3@@ ,@@ 4 million euros better than planned between January and June .
E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e &apos;s result showed a surplus of 4@@ ,@@ 3 million euros during the first half of the year .
the result was especially good in the family and social welfare services , where , by developing preventive services , it has been possible to clear institutional care .
the sta@@ tu@@ tory care guarantee was fulfilled in all operations .
this year E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e &apos;s goal is to make the operation qu@@ e@@ ues shor@@ ter .
E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e uses the surplus to cover deficit from earlier .
the part left over from that is possibly used to shor@@ ten the qu@@ e@@ ues and to buy operations for patients .
the result for the whole year is expected to be 4@@ ,@@ 6 million euros better than planned .
E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e &apos;s board dis@@ cus@@ ses the hal@@ f@@ -@@ year review in its meeting next Wednesday .

the sol@@ di@@ er o@@ ath occasion of the con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts from the B@@ order and Co@@ ast Gu@@ ard Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y was organised in Im@@ m@@ ol@@ a on Friday .
the o@@ ath occasion for the 10@@ th course of special border ja@@ eg@@ ers was organised on the gar@@ ris@@ on &apos;s sport field .
70 con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts s@@ wor@@ e the o@@ ath .
the special border ja@@ eg@@ ers are trained for demanding tasks of border safety , surveillance , and battle .
they serve for 3@@ 47 days .
this year there were 3@@ 10 young persons applying to be special board ja@@ eg@@ ers .
250 of them were invited to entr@@ ance examination .
special board ja@@ eg@@ ers have been trained in Im@@ m@@ ol@@ a since 2007 .
in a ve@@ ter@@ an meeting that was organised in connection with the o@@ ath occasion had five ve@@ ter@@ ans from the war@@ time bo@@ ar@@ der troops .
the average age of those present was now 90 years .
the ol@@ des@@ t ve@@ ter@@ ans that took part in the occasion were born in 19@@ 18 .
an io@@ ta ahead of the criminal - criminal intelligence aids in solving crimes and reve@@ als serious crimin@@ ality - ES@@ S@@ .@@ f@@ i
in every 11 police departments in Finland , there has been a R@@ T@@ A unit ( criminal intelligence and analysis unit ) in operation since the beginning of 20@@ 14 .
the operation of the unit is inv@@ isi@@ ble to the outside .
in H@@ ä@@ me Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment , the unit consists of a total of four polic@@ em@@ en in La@@ h@@ ti and H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inna .
it is managed by a S@@ eni@@ or ser@@ ge@@ ant located in La@@ h@@ ti .
the head of the com@@ man@@ ding O@@ ffic@@ ers is an In@@ spec@@ tor in La@@ h@@ ti .
in addition , the unit has a civilian speci@@ alising in information technology working in H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inna .
all of the unit work in pla@@ in@@ -@@ c@@ lo@@ th@@ es .
the unit has proved its us@@ ability and necessity , considers De@@ pu@@ ty Pol@@ ice Chi@@ ef T@@ ero Sep@@ p@@ än@@ en .
the R@@ T@@ A unit produc@@ es different kinds of reports for the rest of the Pol@@ ice .
in H@@ ä@@ me it has , among other things , gather@@ ed information about asylum seekers .
the most recent method reform
establishing the analysis units has been the most recent reform of the Pol@@ ice methods .
the goal has been crime prevention , so that police would less often leave , si@@ ren b@@ lar@@ ing , for the crime sc@@ ene after it has been al@@ er@@ ted .
the data gather@@ ed and analys@@ ed by the unit helps to focus the daily police activities to where they are needed the most .
with the re@@ formation of the National Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard , one criminal intelligence centre was founded in the country , and under it three national units with an own crime intelligence unit in each police depart@@ ment .
the P@@ C@@ B Centre in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a oper@@ ates in contact with the National Bureau of In@@ ves@@ tig@@ ation and manag@@ es the operations on a national level .
as the name suggests , there are people from the Pol@@ ice , the Cus@@ tom@@ s and the B@@ order Gu@@ ard working in the P@@ C@@ B units .
as for R@@ T@@ A units , they work on areas divided according to police departments , and their duty is to offer data both to local police forces and national units .
intelligence exten@@ ds outside the own area
where a single police offic@@ er knows , what has happened during their 12@@ -@@ hour work shift , the task of an R@@ T@@ A unit is to know , what is going on in the whole are of a police depart@@ ment .
intelligence also exten@@ ds outside the own depart@@ ment &apos;s borders , since so does the crime .
those working in an R@@ T@@ A unit have better IT skills than a ran@@ k and f@@ ile police offic@@ er .
the unit aims to call the Pol@@ ice &apos;s attention to new phen@@ om@@ ena , productive criminals or crimes res@@ emb@@ ling each other by using regis@@ ters , al@@ arm as@@ sign@@ ment datab@@ ase , and observations .
this is called seri@@ alisation , and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence .
all people have their own way of operating .
the hand of a person can be seen also in their work , be it honest or criminal .
based on the techni@@ que , a certain image is formed of the person .
S@@ er@@ i@@ alisation can be per@@ formed either based on the techni@@ que or on the person , depending on which the police have more information on .
criminals learn from their mistakes
the employees in an R@@ T@@ A unit do not w@@ al@@ k around with their coll@@ ars turned up , but their work is not completely public , either .
they do not tell about the methods used by them or by the criminals , because this could result in the professional criminals developing their operations and thus seeking to fo@@ il the police &apos;s crime prevention attempts .
the police will publicly share the methods , if they anticip@@ ate a threat from them .
one such case was the way of marking empty a@@ part@@ ments that was used in break@@ -@@ ins and was reported in the beginning of the summer .
in this method , the criminals marked the front door with a stick , a p@@ in or a piece of ta@@ pe to test , whether the oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ ts were really away .
P@@ re@@ -@@ trial investigation material is public at least for the parties involved .
the analysis unit has observed that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes .
the most cle@@ ver ones order the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court official record that can for example reve@@ al that there were fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ ts found from the sc@@ ene .
the next time , the thi@@ ev@@ es will use g@@ lo@@ ves .
De@@ pu@@ ty Pol@@ ice Chi@@ ef T@@ ero Sep@@ p@@ än@@ en from H@@ ä@@ me Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment , In@@ spec@@ tor Tu@@ om@@ o Le@@ pol@@ a from Eastern Finland Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment , detec@@ tive In@@ spec@@ tor S@@ am@@ i J@@ out@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i from J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u police sta@@ tion , and detec@@ tive super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent Ar@@ to Tu@@ om@@ ela from National Bureau of In@@ ves@@ tig@@ ation were inter@@ viewed for this story .
the Pol@@ ice ga@@ thers and analys@@ es date that is used in planning the practical operations .
on the background is the reduction of work@@ force and funding .
the first steps to@@ ward new work@@ ings were taken already 30 years ago .
the latest change was a thre@@ e@@ -@@ stage P@@ O@@ R@@ A reform that finished by the end of year 20@@ 13 .
information beyond the borders of one &apos;s own depart@@ ment and of Finland is gather@@ ed with national cooperation .
London scho@@ ol@@ g@@ ir@@ l who joined IS@@ I@@ L killed in Syria
K@@ ad@@ iz@@ a S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a , one of three British scho@@ ol@@ girls who left London last year to join IS@@ I@@ L , has re@@ porte@@ dly died in Syria .
At@@ tor@@ ney T@@ as@@ n@@ ime A@@ k@@ u@@ n@@ j@@ ee said her family learned of her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s str@@ on@@ gh@@ old in the country , IT@@ V Ne@@ ws reported on Thursday .
S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to fle@@ e the war@@ -@@ tor@@ n country and return to Britain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tom@@ b@@ stone and te@@ sta@@ ment to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dis@@ su@@ ade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; A@@ k@@ u@@ n@@ j@@ ee said .
in February 2015 , S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a and two other scho@@ ol@@ girls from east London bo@@ ar@@ ded a flight to Turkey and then a b@@ us to the Sy@@ rian border .
S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a &apos;s family was told she mar@@ ried an IS@@ I@@ L fi@@ ghter in Syria - and became a wid@@ ow within months .
R@@ ei@@ d says C@@ lin@@ ton will stick with Gar@@ land as Su@@ pre@@ me Court n@@ om@@ ine@@ e if elected
Sen@@ ate Democratic Le@@ ad@@ er Har@@ ry R@@ ei@@ d says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton will nomin@@ ate J@@ ud@@ ge Mer@@ ric@@ k Gar@@ land to the Su@@ pre@@ me Court if she is elected president .
Sen@@ ate Re@@ public@@ ans have bloc@@ ked Gar@@ land &apos;s confir@@ mation since President Bar@@ ac@@ k Ob@@ ama nomin@@ ated him in March .
Sen@@ ate majority Le@@ ad@@ er Mit@@ ch Mc@@ C@@ onn@@ ell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Su@@ pre@@ me Court Justice An@@ ton@@ in S@@ cal@@ ia .
R@@ ei@@ d said on a conference call Thursday that he is predic@@ ting C@@ lin@@ ton will pick Gar@@ land &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spo@@ kes@@ woman for R@@ ei@@ d later said he had not spoken to C@@ lin@@ ton directly about whether she would nomin@@ ate Gar@@ land and was spec@@ ula@@ ting .
he p@@ raised Gar@@ land and said C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; ro@@ ck the bo@@ at &quot; with a new pick .
Gar@@ land is the chi@@ ef judge for the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the Dis@@ tric@@ t of C@@ olum@@ bia cir@@ cu@@ it .
R@@ ei@@ d said Re@@ public@@ ans who are bloc@@ king Gar@@ land &apos;s nomin@@ ation are &quot; min@@ ions &quot; and &quot; en@@ ab@@ l@@ ers &quot; of Re@@ public@@ an presidential candidate D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p .
he said tr@@ um@@ p is un@@ fit for office .

but instead of famous na@@ ked people , they &apos;@@ re setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 20@@ 17 N@@ U M@@ uses cal@@ end@@ ar .
treat@@ s president Ste@@ ve S@@ ha@@ w told us earlier this year that his nu@@ de@@ -@@ heavy ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine di@@ ffers from ol@@ d@@ -@@ school P@@ la@@ y@@ bo@@ ys because &quot; P@@ la@@ y@@ bo@@ y is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks the cal@@ end@@ ar is , too .
&quot; we need to get back to s@@ ho@@ w@@ cas@@ ing ti@@ mel@@ ess and classi@@ c n@@ ud@@ ity where women , as well as men , feel comfor@@ table and inspi@@ red by these im@@ ages of the female body , &quot; S@@ ha@@ w said in a press release announ@@ cing the cal@@ end@@ ar .
women will want to be a part of this project because it &apos;s a be@@ auti@@ ful piece of art .
models can submit pic@@ s on@@ line or in person at open cas@@ ting calls in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es and New York .
V@@ in@@ y@@ l destin@@ ation : who is actually bu@@ ying rec@@ ords ?
l@@ on@@ ely , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men lo@@ ve v@@ in@@ y@@ l .
before you rus@@ h to l@@ itte@@ r the comments section with gn@@ arly insul@@ ts under the p@@ se@@ ud@@ ony@@ m N@@ ot@@ A@@ ll@@ L@@ on@@ el@@ y@@ M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ Ag@@ ed@@ M@@ en , this statement deriv@@ es from actual data .
according to Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v , the much tal@@ ke@@ d@@ -@@ about record res@@ urg@@ ence is driven not by a bo@@ om in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to emb@@ race the no@@ vel@@ ty of a physical item , but by mid@@ life nos@@ tal@@ g@@ ia .
those who have recently purch@@ ased a v@@ in@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18@@ -@@ 24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of ho@@ ar@@ ding by ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists , either - it has emo@@ tional significance : older v@@ in@@ y@@ l bu@@ yers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % ver@@ su@@ s 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % ver@@ su@@ s 66 % ) .
but are Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results true ?
if this blo@@ g was a tel@@ ev@@ ised news report , the ca@@ mer@@ a would follow me as I w@@ al@@ ked down the middle of a bus@@ y S@@ oh@@ o stre@@ et , we@@ aring a modest gre@@ y su@@ it and ges@@ turing w@@ il@@ dly before sto@@ pping , c@@ up@@ ping my hands and saying something author@@ itative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of S@@ oh@@ o is slowly being dra@@ ined of its char@@ m and gro@@ t - ho@@ tel@@ s , e@@ ats , P@@ re@@ ts and Pa@@ per@@ ch@@ ases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sell@@ ers - a hand@@ ful of fan@@ tas@@ tic speci@@ alist record sh@@ ops still remain .
I &apos;@@ d probably ask the ca@@ mer@@ a to stop ro@@ lling for the next bit , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these sto@@ res and attempt to g@@ au@@ ge their age and emo@@ tional dis@@ position via observation .
G@@ las@@ we@@ gian S@@ tu@@ art , 55 , whom I follow from sis@@ ter R@@ ay ( data count : two young women , three mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men ) into rec@@ kl@@ ess Rec@@ ords ( data count : eight mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men , one woman , probably in her 20@@ s ) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is per@@ us@@ ing the sh@@ ops to fill a few hours .
is he a collec@@ tor , I ask ?
&quot; I sup@@ pose I am , &quot; he says .
I have about 3@@ ,@@ 000 or 4@@ ,@@ 000 rec@@ ords .
these rec@@ ords , pic@@ tured above ( he em@@ a@@ iled me the s@@ na@@ p , I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t follow him home ) , line his living room w@@ all@@ s .
his reason for acqu@@ iring such a vast number of al@@ bu@@ ms and sing@@ les is partly a result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy rec@@ ords he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t afford when they originally came out , and to re@@ purch@@ ase items he sold when he was young and s@@ kin@@ t .
&quot; a lot of the stu@@ ff I get is late 6@@ 0s , early 7@@ 0s , things that came out when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who purch@@ ase rec@@ ords are more likely to be in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts who like their own company , adding : &quot; I don &apos;@@ t smo@@ ke , I don &apos;@@ t drin@@ k very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
W@@ ez , 25 , who works at sis@@ ter R@@ ay , also believes that many of the customers he en@@ coun@@ ters fit the Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influ@@ enc@@ ed by the media hy@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ e@@ back and felt comp@@ elled to buy back their old rec@@ ords .
from conver@@ sa@@ tions I &apos;@@ ve had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their v@@ in@@ y@@ l to buy C@@ D@@ s are now sell@@ ing their C@@ D@@ s to buy their rec@@ ords back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a bo@@ om in v@@ in@@ y@@ l revi@@ val@@ ists of a certain age .
but what about the alleg@@ ed emo@@ tional importance of rec@@ ords ?
it takes a few secon@@ ds in a sho@@ p such as P@@ hon@@ ic@@ a to realise that record sto@@ res offer a comfor@@ ting community of lik@@ em@@ in@@ ded types .
according to W@@ ez , some older customers have taken um@@ bra@@ ge with the contac@@ tless payment system in particular .
some v@@ in@@ y@@ l f@@ ans may feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and choose to re@@ treat to the stability of the familiar record s@@ le@@ eve , of items that recall hal@@ cy@@ on te@@ en@@ age mem@@ or@@ ies .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be fill@@ ing a vo@@ id or having material pos@@ sessions as some kind of comfor@@ t , &quot; W@@ ez says .
as a collec@@ tor myself , I have that , and I think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occup@@ y your head@@ space .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re like their social workers ! &quot; pi@@ p@@ es up a co@@ -@@ wor@@ ker from a sta@@ ck of rec@@ ords .
an IC@@ M pol@@ l in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who b@@ ought a v@@ in@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a tur@@ n@@ table they never use , while 7 % of those who purch@@ ase v@@ in@@ y@@ l don &apos;@@ t own a record pla@@ yer .
at this stage of the news report , I would probably be looking gra@@ vely concerned while f@@ lic@@ king through a sta@@ ck of b@@ ossa No@@ va com@@ pi@@ la@@ tions .
the &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; aspect of the revi@@ val is something that J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in s@@ ounds of the uni@@ verse ( data count : three mid@@ de@@ -@@ aged men ) has noticed .
&quot; someone came in recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;@@ t have a record pla@@ yer , but I want to buy a Rad@@ io@@ head record so we can put it on our sh@@ elf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the musi@@ c .
we have people saying : &quot; I don &apos;@@ t have a record pla@@ yer . &quot;
that &apos;s youn@@ ger people , not older ones , late te@@ ens who are just getting into it .
F@@ op@@ p , which now ded@@ ic@@ ates almost an entire floor to v@@ in@@ y@@ l , has a far more vari@@ ed au@@ di@@ ence when I arrive .
there are cou@@ ples in their 7@@ 0s , touris@@ ts taking p@@ ho@@ tos , te@@ en@@ age bo@@ ys and mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at e@@ ase than the a@@ fore@@ mentioned sto@@ res - W@@ il@@ d be@@ ast &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ - and sex@@ -@@ fu@@ elled po@@ p , rather than no@@ od@@ ling ja@@ z@@ z , is b@@ lasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly l@@ on@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ging psych@@ ological tra@@ u@@ ma is hard to as@@ certain by standing next to someone for 30 secon@@ ds .
E@@ lan@@ or@@ a , 27 , has been w@@ al@@ king around F@@ op@@ p for a few minutes , looking at the variety of rec@@ ords on sale .
she is win@@ dow@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing , rather than on a spending spre@@ e .
she do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t ear@@ n a lot , she says , so collec@@ ting rec@@ ords is@@ n &apos;@@ t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to musi@@ c by a computer or another way , but the be@@ au@@ ty of v@@ in@@ y@@ l is ... &quot; she dri@@ f@@ ts off into a lo@@ ves@@ truc@@ k si@@ gh .
I don &apos;@@ t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a sho@@ p said to have inspi@@ red a fresh generation of v@@ in@@ y@@ l lo@@ vers : urban O@@ ut@@ f@@ it@@ ters .
while giving the ill@@ u@@ sion of per@@ us@@ ing the d@@ eni@@ m ho@@ t pan@@ ts , I observe a group of te@@ en@@ age girls , who cl@@ us@@ ter around the Pol@@ ar@@ o@@ id ca@@ mer@@ as mom@@ en@@ tar@@ ily , before a d@@ ad and his d@@ au@@ ghter deliberate purch@@ asing a C@@ ros@@ ley record pla@@ yer .
to the left is a sta@@ ir@@ well , a wall of which is sta@@ cked with rec@@ ords by A@@ del@@ e , J@@ ef@@ f B@@ uc@@ k@@ ley , A@@ my W@@ in@@ eh@@ ouse and F@@ le@@ et@@ wood Ma@@ c : a mi@@ x of con@@ temporary and classi@@ c@@ s , the essential rec@@ ords for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely dec@@ or@@ ation , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pur@@ e &quot; art v@@ in@@ y@@ l . &quot;
but , given that any attrac@@ tion to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the de@@ p@@ ths of S@@ oh@@ o for more , there is little to compla@@ in about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spen@@ ds the most on lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y items such as v@@ in@@ y@@ l .
but while my findings suggest Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results are accurate , in S@@ oh@@ o record sto@@ res at least , they do not dis@@ count the huge number of female collec@@ tors and v@@ in@@ y@@ l lo@@ vers that exist in reality , in record sh@@ ops and on on@@ line for@@ ums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their Thursday mor@@ nings lo@@ i@@ tering around the record sh@@ ops of Ber@@ w@@ ick S@@ tre@@ et , f@@ lic@@ king through rec@@ ords and avoid@@ ing the ga@@ ze of a cre@@ ep@@ y , 30@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old fa@@ ke television pres@@ enter who is lo@@ om@@ ing over the shoul@@ ders of un@@ sus@@ pec@@ ting mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects b@@ id to dem@@ ol@@ ish sh@@ ops at J@@ un@@ g@@ le refugee cam@@ p
a French court has rejected a b@@ id by C@@ ala@@ is authorities to dem@@ ol@@ ish do@@ z@@ ens of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ ops and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants in the J@@ un@@ g@@ le cam@@ p where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , C@@ ala@@ is authorities had argu@@ ed the state should be able to kno@@ ck down a total of 72 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ ops where people inside the cam@@ p sell goods , from cigar@@ et@@ tes to energy drin@@ ks , offer ha@@ ir@@ cuts , or sell te@@ a for 50 c@@ ents ( 4@@ 0@@ p ) or basic me@@ als for a few euros in ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants .
the C@@ ala@@ is pre@@ f@@ ec@@ t &apos;s office argu@@ ed the places should be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and san@@ itation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the sh@@ ops and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants were vital , saying the free me@@ als offered by a sta@@ te@@ -@@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the cam@@ p .
they argu@@ ed the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ ops and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants often provided sh@@ el@@ ter and free me@@ als to those in need .
a L@@ ill@@ e court rul@@ ed there was no legal basis for exp@@ elling the people running the 72 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ ops , but said the C@@ ala@@ is pre@@ f@@ ec@@ t &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , Je@@ an@@ -@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is M@@ oll@@ a , said the gro@@ cer@@ ies , c@@ af@@ es and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants played a much big@@ ger role than simply fe@@ eding people that &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ar@@ ious conditions . &quot;
he said the sp@@ ac@@ es provided cal@@ m meeting points between refugees and volun@@ te@@ ers .
one of the places that had been under threat from dem@@ ol@@ ition was the cam@@ p &apos;s J@@ un@@ g@@ le Bo@@ ok kid@@ s &quot; C@@ af@@ e which is run no@@ t@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ profit and provides 200 me@@ als a day , English and French classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the cam@@ p .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 people have signed a petition to protect the kid@@ s &quot; CA@@ F@@ E .
a letter sent to the Gu@@ ar@@ dian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrop@@ he for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two char@@ ities , Hel@@ p Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ A@@ u@@ ber@@ ge des M@@ ig@@ ran@@ ts , on Friday estimated that numbers in the J@@ un@@ g@@ le cam@@ p have r@@ isen to over 9@@ ,@@ 000 people - the highest ever - after a ste@@ ep increase in arri@@ val@@ s during the summer .
the price of the food in Finland dro@@ ps clearly faster than the EU average
food becomes strik@@ ingly che@@ aper in Finland - a source of jo@@ y for consumers and of anno@@ y@@ ance to producers .
the price of food in Finland has dro@@ pped nearly 5 per cent in three years , when the average price drop in EU countries was 0.@@ 9 per cent .
at the same time food in Germany and Sweden is one per cent more expensive .
during the last three years , the price of food in Finland has dro@@ pped the second most in those EU countries that have the same wage level than Finland .
from the an@@ alogue countries &quot; only Britain &apos;s food prices have gone down faster than in Finland .
this data was shown in an article by senior advis@@ er I@@ l@@ k@@ ka L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen from Sta@@ tis@@ tics Finland that was published in Ti@@ e@@ to &amp; T@@ rend@@ it ( D@@ a@@ ta &amp; T@@ ren@@ ds ) blo@@ g .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen compared real prices , prices that are in proportion to the general development of the consumer prices .
the latest data is from June this year .
in the beginning of the 20@@ 10@@ s , the price of the food ro@@ se shar@@ ply .
in 20@@ 13 , the prices ro@@ se close to the price level of 1994 .
the situation was al@@ arming .
&quot; we were close to losing that price advantage we got from EU membership , &quot; L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen says .
then a change followed , after which food has become che@@ aper year by year .
now the price is w@@ eigh@@ ed down by the food import prohib@@ itions set by Russia that brought food import from Finland to Russia to a stand@@ still .
that is why the supply of da@@ iry and meat products has increased in the Finn@@ ish market , and the producer prices have dro@@ pped .
&quot; Putin &apos;s policies have helped the Finn@@ ish consumer in the short term , &quot; says L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen .
also the competition between industry and trade has ste@@ pped up and affected the price drop .
the large cha@@ ins , S Group and K@@ es@@ ko , have both reduced their prices .
for the consumer the price competition has appeared as im@@ pressive advertising campaigns .
Finland still is no seat of affor@@ d@@ able nou@@ ris@@ hment , even though the price of the food has dro@@ pped significantly .
in 2015 , the food prices in Finland were the fourth most expensive from those EU countries that have the same kind of wage level than Finland .
according to L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen , the food prices in Finland are considerably affected by the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax .
he discovered that if the control countries would have the same percentage of valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax , Finland would have the third che@@ ap@@ est food from the countries that have the same wage level .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen compared Finland with Denmark , Sweden , Austria , France , Italy , Britain , Germany , and the Netherlands .
if the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax in the control countries would be seven , only the Ger@@ man@@ s and the Dutch would sell che@@ aper food than the Finn@@ s .
&quot; if we want to get to the same food price level with the old EU countries , we have to hal@@ ve the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax to the average EU country level , and to continue price competition , &quot; L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen w@@ ri@@ tes .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen points out that the calcula@@ tions he did with the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax percentage are appro@@ x@@ imate .
the school is not quite what it used to be
those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer .
a new teac@@ hing curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum has been created for schools , and it will be implemented in the beginning of the sem@@ es@@ ter in all primary schools .
they are the guidelines that go@@ ver@@ n all Finn@@ ish schools .
the schools decide on the details themselves , but the curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum states the official goals .
these guidelines have been prepared for several years , and they differ from the old ones in many ways .
for example cur@@ sive hand@@ writing will not be tau@@ ght an@@ y@@ more , and instead cod@@ ing will be prac@@ tis@@ ed at schools .
instruc@@ tion in Swedish will begin on the sixth grade the latest , and social studies will begin already on the fourth grade .
the biggest change , however , concerns the role of the pu@@ p@@ ils .
before it was thought that a teac@@ her teac@@ hes the pu@@ p@@ ils , but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another .
this is an attempt to make education more interesting .
the long@@ est li@@ ved ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the world was found - the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k can live up to 400 years
the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k ( Som@@ ni@@ os@@ us mic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ h@@ alu@@ s ) , also known as the gre@@ y shar@@ k , does not reach its sexual ma@@ tur@@ ity until it is 150 years old .
it can live 250 years after that , a new study reported .
these numbers make this species to be the long@@ est li@@ ved ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the modern world .
in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom there is only one who pass@@ es it : the ol@@ des@@ t oc@@ ean qu@@ a@@ ho@@ g known has been estimated to be 5@@ 0@@ 7 years old .
Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ ks s@@ wi@@ m around the North Atlantic .
they also hold another record : they are also the biggest fish in the Ar@@ c@@ tic area .
the f@@ em@@ al@@ es are tall@@ er than the mal@@ es , as they can grow to be over five met@@ res tal@@ l .
since the rate of growth is slow , only about a c@@ enti@@ met@@ re a year according to monitoring , the ad@@ ult spec@@ im@@ ens must have li@@ ved a long life .
but how long ?
Ju@@ li@@ us Ni@@ el@@ sen from the Uni@@ versity of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out .
he determined the ages of 28 ad@@ ult female Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ ks that had been tra@@ pped in fishermen &apos;s n@@ ets .
the age of the fish was revealed in radi@@ oc@@ ar@@ bon dating their eye l@@ ens@@ es .
the average age of the stu@@ died shar@@ ks was revealed to be at least 27@@ 2 years .
the two largest fish in the sa@@ mp@@ le , the ama@@ z@@ on@@ -@@ sized fish of 4@@ 93 and 5@@ 02 c@@ enti@@ met@@ res long , were revealed to 3@@ 35 and 3@@ 92 years old respec@@ tively .
since the other studies have found out that the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k f@@ em@@ al@@ es do not reach ma@@ tur@@ ity until they are over 4 met@@ res long , the researchers calcula@@ ted they are about 150 years old at that stage .
the study was published by Sci@@ ence .
S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann a@@ xes up rou@@ gh@@ ly 300 employees - the number of sales assis@@ tants sta@@ ys the same
nearly 300 employees are laid off from the depart@@ ment stor@@ e company S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann .
the consul@@ tative negotiations in the company that has g@@ ot@@ ten into difficulties finished in the beginning of August .
&quot; as a result of the negotiations , approximately 300 jobs will be cut , main part of the cuts will be carried out as la@@ y@@ -@@ off@@ s , &quot; S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann says in its press release .
it is also said in the press release that the number of depart@@ ment stor@@ e sales assis@@ tants will not be reduced to ensure excellent custom@@ er service .
S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann will also offer around 80 members of its support staff new positions as sales assis@@ tants .
S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann &apos;s negotiations concerned about 3@@ 000 employees .
when they began , the need for cuts was estimated to be about 3@@ 80 employees .
the cuts are expected to generate annual cost savings of rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 million euros that are supposed to realise during next year .
already earlier S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann has begun an efficiency programme , with which they attempt to create savings of 50 million euros this year .
on the background are S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann &apos;s difficulties to make depart@@ ment stor@@ e sales profitable .
even though the group &apos;s adjus@@ ted operating result improved to 11@@ .@@ 1 million euros in the second quar@@ ter of the year , the depart@@ ment stor@@ e sales are still un@@ profitable .
La@@ ur@@ i V@@ ei@@ j@@ ala@@ inen , the care@@ ta@@ ker chi@@ ef executive of S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann says that the sales performance of the depart@@ ment sto@@ res has continued to fall short of expectations .
&quot; personnel reductions are unfortunately a necessary step to ensure that S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann &apos;s re@@ ta@@ il division achiev@@ es a positive result in 20@@ 18 , &quot; V@@ ei@@ j@@ ala@@ inen says in the press release .
the improved secon@@ d@@ -@@ quar@@ ter result is particularly a consequence of the solid performance of fashion chain L@@ inde@@ x .
the chain reported the best secon@@ d@@ -@@ quar@@ ter tur@@ no@@ ver and result in its history .
L@@ inde@@ x &apos;s profit increased 9@@ .5 million euros to 2@@ 8@@ .@@ 1 million euros .
at the same time last year , the operating result of the whole S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann Group had a loss of 4@@ .@@ 1 million .
S@@ to@@ ck@@ mann estimates that the Group &apos;s tur@@ no@@ ver this year will be smaller than last year .
the adjus@@ ted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year .
on Friday , the North will be most ra@@ in@@ y - tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures under 20 degre@@ es in the whole country

there will be ra@@ in s@@ ho@@ w@@ ers also in the central parts of the country , but the wea@@ ther will be fair far@@ ther south .
the tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures are not very sum@@ mer@@ y an@@ y@@ more , because the mer@@ cur@@ y will stay below 20 degre@@ es in the whole country .
the ra@@ in@@ y areas in the north will remain in 10@@ -@@ 15 degre@@ es .
K@@ en@@ ya &apos;s a@@ th@@ le@@ tics team is sha@@ ken by a dop@@ ing scandal - an od@@ d explanation to a co@@ ach &apos;s move
a K@@ en@@ y@@ an a@@ th@@ le@@ tics co@@ ach , Joh@@ n An@@ z@@ ra@@ h , has been sent home from Rio Olymp@@ ics after he was found to have been posing as a national team a@@ th@@ l@@ ete in dop@@ ing tests .
the news agency A@@ P said that the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete An@@ z@@ ra@@ h was presenting himself as was the 8@@ 00@@ m sta@@ r Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
Ste@@ ph@@ en Ara@@ p so@@ i , who is part of K@@ en@@ ya &apos;s national team management , said that An@@ z@@ ra@@ h &apos;s identity was revealed after he had given a sa@@ mp@@ le as Ro@@ ti@@ ch in a surprise test .
the dop@@ ing officials reported An@@ z@@ ra@@ h to the authorities .
according to so@@ i , An@@ z@@ ra@@ h was sent home because he &quot; committed his crime against team K@@ en@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; he presented himself as an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete , gave the ur@@ ine sa@@ mp@@ le and even signed the documents .
we cannot toler@@ ate such behaviour , &quot; grow@@ led Ki@@ p K@@ e@@ ino , chairman of the National Olymp@@ ic Committee of K@@ en@@ ya to the news agency Re@@ u@@ ters .
the Olymp@@ ic a@@ th@@ le@@ tics beg@@ ins on Friday , and Ro@@ ti@@ ch is to run already on that day .
there is no information yet about whether the run@@ ner faces some consequences about the incident .
last year at the world cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship Ro@@ ti@@ ch was fourth on this distance , and is one of the fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes to win in Rio .
according to Re@@ u@@ ters , a source from inside the K@@ en@@ y@@ an a@@ th@@ le@@ tics team claimed that An@@ z@@ ra@@ h only used the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s acc@@ re@@ di@@ tation card to get free break@@ fas@@ ts in the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s vill@@ age .
when he met the anti@@ -@@ dop@@ ing officials , they expected him to be an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete , and he was taken to a test .
the co@@ ach did not explain the situation to the officials , because he was afraid of being exposed .
where is everyone ?
the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics sta@@ di@@ um in Rio is empty
indeed , where is everyone ?
they are certainly not at the Rio Olymp@@ ic sta@@ di@@ um wat@@ ching a@@ th@@ le@@ tics .
the battle for a@@ th@@ le@@ tics med@@ als in Rio began on Friday , but the world &apos;s top individuals got to s@@ ho@@ w@@ case their tal@@ ents to conf@@ us@@ ingly empty stands .
the organis@@ ers of Rio told on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first day &apos;s morning competition tic@@ kets and 65 per cent of the evening competition tic@@ kets have been sold .
the situation was different four years ago in London , where the sta@@ di@@ um was bur@@ s@@ ting with che@@ ering people .
the fin@@ als tic@@ ket are sold out already also at Rio .
the spec@@ ta@@ tor loss at Rio Olymp@@ ics has attrac@@ ted attention already before a@@ th@@ le@@ tics .
there have been thousands of empty seats for example in ru@@ g@@ by , can@@ o@@ eing , and rid@@ ing stands .
when the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian med@@ al hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ s T@@ al@@ ita An@@ tun@@ es and L@@ ar@@ is@@ sa fran@@ ca played be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y at leg@@ end@@ ary C@@ op@@ ac@@ ab@@ ana , only 70 per cent of the stands were full .
after the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian du@@ o , the Netherlands played against Russia , and only about 30 per cent of the stands that seat 12@@ .000 people were full .
the bad sales are partly explained by the fact that Bra@@ z@@ il with its economic difficulties is far away for the European and Asian Olymp@@ ic touris@@ ts , and many of the Olymp@@ ic sports are strange to Bra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans , who are accus@@ tom@@ ed to football .
however , not even the first match of the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian football team managed to fill the football sta@@ di@@ um .
the spo@@ kes@@ man for the game organis@@ ers , Mar@@ io An@@ dra@@ da , said this weekend that at that time , 82 per cent of the tic@@ kets had been sold , a number that is clearly smaller than four years ago .
&quot; there are still 1.@@ 1 million tic@@ kets left to be sold , &quot; An@@ dra@@ da said according to Re@@ u@@ ters .
from the 8@@ .5 million tic@@ kets in the London Olymp@@ ics 8@@ .@@ 2 million were sold , even though they were almost half more expensive than in Rio .
in Rio , the tic@@ ket prices have vari@@ ed from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening .
over half of the tic@@ kets cost under 16 euros .
in London Olymp@@ ics , the voluntary workers and army personnel were allowed to sit on the empty seats , but in Rio this has not been allowed yet , as the organis@@ ers need money and attempt to sell the tic@@ kets until the very last moment .
however , in Rio , the organis@@ ers have given school children 2@@ 4@@ 0.@@ 000 tic@@ kets for those sports that are less known in the country , like g@@ old and ru@@ g@@ by .
there were pl@@ enty of empty seats in the Rio Sta@@ di@@ um in the morning .
even be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y at the san@@ ds of C@@ op@@ ac@@ ab@@ ana did not interest the au@@ di@@ ence .
Ju@@ k@@ ka K@@ es@@ k@@ is@@ al@@ o compe@@ ted in London in 20@@ 12 .
there were pl@@ enty of people at the stands , then .
a new way to protect the nature - buy a right to a piece of land
Helsinki F@@ ound@@ ation has new ways to take part in nature conservation .
the F@@ ound@@ ation , established last year , acqu@@ i@@ res ec@@ olog@@ ically significant areas of land .
after that , private people , companies , and communities can purch@@ ase guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship rights to a block of land .
the F@@ ound@@ ation &apos;s first land property is located in L@@ ap@@ land .
the land property is virtually sub@@ divided into small Gre@@ ens@@ pac@@ es , and those who want , can buy a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship right to a Gre@@ ens@@ pace .
the Gu@@ ar@@ dian has veto rights to their space of 18@@ 7 squ@@ are met@@ res , which in prac@@ tise means that if the large land block &apos;s purpose is to be changed , a per@@ mission from each Gu@@ ar@@ dian is required .
it is possible also to buy Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ ships for several Gre@@ ens@@ pac@@ es .
bu@@ ying a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship is something tangible you can pass down or give as a gi@@ ft .
&quot; there is no need to carry b@@ ann@@ ers or to chain yourself to something in order to protect the nature , &quot; expla@@ ins J@@ uh@@ a Le@@ vi@@ ä@@ k@@ an@@ gas , who acquired a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship for his company .
those who acquire a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship get the exact co@@ -@@ ordin@@ ates of their Gre@@ ens@@ pace , which makes it possible for example to visit the area .
on the F@@ ound@@ ation &apos;s web@@ site one can see the name information of the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans on the same map , where the Gre@@ ens@@ pace information is .
Le@@ vi@@ ä@@ k@@ an@@ gas thinks the only risk in his nature conservation purch@@ ase is if the F@@ ound@@ ation &apos;s operations change from its original idea .
the Helsinki F@@ ound@@ ation is a n@@ on@@ -@@ profit foundation established for the purpose of promoting the conservation of environment and nature .
the risk is for the F@@ ound@@ ation to act in une@@ th@@ ically or commer@@ cially , but it should not be possible .
the basic idea of the Helsinki F@@ ound@@ ation &apos;s H@@ al@@ ti@@ ja project is to protect nature areas in a way they can stay un@@ spo@@ iled and at peace .
the F@@ ound@@ ation acqu@@ i@@ res land bloc@@ ks either by bu@@ ying or as a don@@ ation .
it finances its operation mainly by sell@@ ing Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ ships , but the F@@ ound@@ ation received its initial capital from its foun@@ ders .
the purpose of the F@@ ound@@ ation is to acquire more protected lands .
it also has plans to go outside Finn@@ ish borders and to buy some land in Austr@@ alia .
the Helsinki F@@ ound@@ ation s@@ ho@@ w@@ cases its operations in a po@@ p up forest at Helsinki Market S@@ qu@@ are from August 13 to 19 .

in addition to Tur@@ k@@ u , Helsinki , O@@ ul@@ u and La@@ h@@ ti were at the top of the list .
according to the police information , there were four to five b@@ ike the@@ f@@ ts per a thousand resid@@ ents .
instead in Es@@ po@@ o and K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a , there were only about two reported b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts per a thousand resid@@ ents .
that is a big difference .
&quot; some cities have double the amount of the@@ f@@ ts per cap@@ ita compared to others , &quot; descri@@ bes Chi@@ ef super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent of the National Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard , T@@ om@@ mi R@@ een .
Tur@@ k@@ u police contemp@@ late , why the city holds the top place in the comparison .
it is extremely difficult to say , why there have been more b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts in Tur@@ k@@ u than elsewhere .
I have no answer for that .
&quot; one factor for the frequ@@ ency of the@@ f@@ ts can be how much b@@ ike traffic there is in a city , and how many b@@ ik@@ es there are in general , &quot; considers S@@ eni@@ or ser@@ ge@@ ant T@@ e@@ em@@ u Ä@@ ik@@ ä@@ s .
T@@ om@@ mi R@@ een from the National Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard says it could be well expected to see Tur@@ k@@ u , Helsinki , and O@@ ul@@ u to rise to the top in the comparison .
the number of b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts largely follow those cities , where people study and where they cycle .
Tur@@ k@@ u has a comp@@ act centre , short dis@@ tances , and pl@@ enty of b@@ ik@@ es available for the thi@@ ev@@ es .
&quot; for example Es@@ po@@ o is a completely different city , where city centres are far from each other , and b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle is not necessarily the primary mod@@ e of transport , &quot; R@@ een says .
in the whole of Finland between January and August , there have been slightly less b@@ ike the@@ f@@ ts reported to the police than during the corresponding period last year .
there is still no great reason for jo@@ y .
despite the down@@ ward trend in recent years , there are still a bit over 20@@ ,@@ 000 b@@ ike the@@ f@@ ts reported to the police ann@@ ually .
that means 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 60 b@@ ik@@ es every day , and just in Helsinki , about 4@@ 000 b@@ ik@@ es per year .
&quot; these numbers are big , &quot; R@@ een says .
in truth , the thi@@ ev@@ es take even more b@@ ik@@ es , because only a part of the victims report a the@@ ft to the police .
R@@ een encoura@@ ges people to report b@@ ike the@@ f@@ ts , even if less than one in every ten reported cases are solved .
a typical solved b@@ ike the@@ ft is a case , where the police is immediately noti@@ fied of the the@@ ft , and the thi@@ ef is caught right away .
&quot; cases are solved also in connection to other investigation , like for example when in a drug case there can be st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles found in an a@@ part@@ ment , &quot; R@@ een tell@@ s .
in Helsinki , b@@ ike thi@@ ev@@ es are caught every week either red@@ -@@ handed or during a police investigation , says S@@ eni@@ or Con@@ stable Tim@@ o L@@ ep@@ p@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki .
according to him , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles are st@@ olen for example from a sh@@ opp@@ ing centre b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle stands , from cour@@ ty@@ ards , stor@@ ero@@ oms and b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle bas@@ ements , so practically from everywhere people usually stor@@ e them .
as to the individual b@@ ike models , the most st@@ olen is J@@ op@@ o , just like in previous years .
a U@@ -@@ lock gives a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle better protection than many other loc@@ ks .
some thi@@ ev@@ es take a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle for example for their own , brief use , but most of the st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles end up for sale for example on@@ line .
the stay in the home market .
&quot; at least it has@@ n &apos;@@ t come to the police &apos;s knowledge that st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles hardly go abroad , &quot; R@@ een says .
bu@@ yers of st@@ olen b@@ ik@@ es are normal Finn@@ ish people , according to the police .
some probably buy a st@@ olen b@@ ike without knowing .
some may have doubts about it .
a used b@@ ike bu@@ yer must be cau@@ tious , because they could commit a conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment offence or a criminal conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment .
&quot; the al@@ arm b@@ ell@@ s should be r@@ inging , if a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle in good condition is being sold di@@ r@@ t cheap , &quot; R@@ een says .
special li@@ br@@ ary assis@@ tant S@@ ever@@ i H@@ ir@@ v@@ i always car@@ ries his col@@ our@@ ful N@@ op@@ sa to a sh@@ el@@ ter provided by li@@ br@@ ary of K@@ all@@ io in Helsinki for the dura@@ tion of his working day .
he has had five b@@ ik@@ es , but none have been st@@ olen , says H@@ ir@@ v@@ i . &quot; never have been taken , so in that sense I &apos;@@ ve been really lu@@ ck@@ y . &quot;
&quot; maybe this is@@ n &apos;@@ t so temp@@ ting for the thi@@ ev@@ es , this do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t necessarily even have any hi@@ p@@ s@@ ter value , &quot; contemp@@ lates H@@ ir@@ v@@ i , who lives in Helsinki .
S@@ i@@ ir@@ i val@@ ve , who briefly did business in a ki@@ os@@ k in K@@ all@@ io , Helsinki , loc@@ ked her b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle with a small U@@ -@@ lock .
now b@@ ike was just le@@ an@@ ing towards the ki@@ os@@ k wall , but usually val@@ ve loc@@ ks her b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle to something solid , like a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle stand .
&quot; I think about this a lot , because this b@@ ike is the most expensive thing I own , &quot; says the Helsinki stud@@ ent about her white b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros .
&quot; I keep hearing from my friends that b@@ ik@@ es have been taken . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ tly bad b@@ ik@@ es , these ric@@ k@@ ety J@@ op@@ os . &quot;
a b@@ ike was st@@ olen from val@@ ve her@@ self from a house cour@@ ty@@ ard a year ago .

those under 15 to account for their crimes ?
Helsinki will exper@@ iment pe@@ er j@@ uri@@ es familiar from the United States
a so@@ -@@ called pe@@ er jur@@ y will exper@@ iment will begin in Helsinki to prevent young people to getting into a vic@@ ious circ@@ le of crime .
at first the exper@@ iment will be applied to those under 15 , who now are left without criminal responsibility .
a jur@@ y of pe@@ ers will wei@@ gh in on the first crime a young person comm@@ its .
the idea is that the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers will discuss what happened with the off@@ ender and prescri@@ be a sanc@@ tion .
a week later the off@@ ender can join the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers themselves to make up for what they did .
other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family expla@@ ining , what has been done and what has been lear@@ n@@ t from it .
Youth work direc@@ tor T@@ om@@ mi La@@ iti@@ o says it is not a strict model .
we also have other conciliation models that are used side by side .
&quot; they all direct a young person &apos;s actions towards a more responsible direction , so that everything would not be ru@@ ined after the first mistake , &quot; says La@@ iti@@ o .
the model for the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers comes from the United States , where it is widely used .
the idea is that after their first crime , the young person do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t have to stand in front of an ad@@ ult pan@@ el , but can reflect what has happened together with other people of approximately the same age .
the model has been tested once .
I@@ l@@ k@@ ka L@@ o@@ vi@@ o , service desig@@ ner from service design office Pal@@ m@@ u who has followed the exper@@ iment says that it was an assa@@ ult that was successfully cle@@ ared up .
before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all .
&quot; it has been a message to carry on on the path you have chosen , &quot; L@@ o@@ vi@@ o says .
the pe@@ er jur@@ y is part of a project focusing on immigrants in Helsinki ( Maa@@ han@@ m@@ uu@@ tta@@ j@@ i@@ en Helsinki ) , on the background of which are the C@@ ity of Helsinki and the We F@@ ound@@ ation .
L@@ o@@ vi@@ o emphasises that these new prac@@ tis@@ es are offered to all who need them , not just for young immigrants .
over 70 Re@@ public@@ an leaders want the party to stop funding tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign
more than 70 influ@@ ential Re@@ public@@ ans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s presidential campaign .
an American newspaper Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o reported about the letter , the draft of which it has obtained .
according to the newspaper , the letter is directed to the Re@@ public@@ an National Committee Chairman Re@@ in@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us .
the sig@@ ne@@ es want the party &apos;s money to be put to@@ ward Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al ra@@ ces , instead of tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign .
&quot; we believe that D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s div@@ isi@@ veness , rec@@ kl@@ ess@@ ness , in@@ competence , and record@@ -@@ breaking un@@ popul@@ arity risk turning this election into a Democratic land@@ sl@@ ide , &quot; it says in the letter as reported by Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o .
only the immediate shift of all available R@@ N@@ C resources to vulnerable Sen@@ ate and House ra@@ ces will prevent the G@@ O@@ P from dro@@ w@@ ning with a T@@ ru@@ mp@@ -@@ emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned an@@ ch@@ or around its nec@@ k .
according to the letter , this should not be a difficult decision , as tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s chan@@ ces of being elected president are eva@@ por@@ ating by the day .
politic@@ o w@@ ri@@ tes that the letter is expected to be sent next week .
politicians G@@ ord@@ on Hu@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y , Ch@@ ris S@@ ha@@ ys , T@@ om C@@ olem@@ an , and V@@ in W@@ e@@ ber are among the sig@@ ne@@ es .
re@@ public@@ an An@@ drew W@@ e@@ ins@@ te@@ in , a vo@@ cal anti@@ -@@ Tr@@ um@@ p Re@@ public@@ an , is one of the oper@@ atives or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ing the letter .
according to Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o , W@@ e@@ ins@@ te@@ in has said that the letter is coming from &quot; people who want the party to protect its maj@@ orities in the Sen@@ ate and the House , &quot; and that it &apos;s not an endor@@ s@@ ement of anybody .
the letter tic@@ ks off a series of D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p actions that are believed to have ali@@ en@@ ated millions of voters .
he is said to also have shown dangerous author@@ ita@@ rian tend@@ encies .
earlier this week 50 officials working among national security w@@ ro@@ te an open letter to state that they won &apos;@@ t support D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p as a president .
C@@ lin@@ ton promises relief to U@@ .@@ S@@ . families with children
in the United States , the Democratic presidential candidate H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton shared details of his economic policy on Thursday evening .
I aim to be the President , so that the U@@ .@@ S@@ . economy would be good for everyone .
&quot; D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p aims to be the President , so that the economy would be good for him and his friends , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton said in her speech .
in the centre of C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s plan is a massive f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year , 27@@ 5@@ -@@ billion dollar plan to improve United States &quot; infrastructure , roads , brid@@ ges , and air@@ fields .
this would be financed partly with tax increases for the rich , partly with private money .
this building programme is a friendly ges@@ ture to American workers who suffered as fac@@ tor@@ ies were transferred to countries with cheap labour .
C@@ lin@@ ton called this programme the greatest investment in w@@ ell@@ -@@ paid jobs since the Sec@@ ond World War .
we are a nation of buil@@ ders , we must return to building !
C@@ lin@@ ton said .
on Thursday , C@@ lin@@ ton also promised to e@@ ase the situation of working families with children .
on Thursday , she s@@ ounded like Sanders anyway as she emphasised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes .
and if a company leaves the United States as a tax ex@@ ile , it should pay a leaving tax , C@@ lin@@ ton said .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays she oppos@@ es the Trans@@ -@@ Pac@@ i@@ fic Part@@ nership she used to support .
&quot; &#91; as the President , &#93; I will oppose all those trade agreements that work against employees or wages , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton promised .
according to the spec@@ ula@@ tions published by The Washington P@@ ost before C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s speech , C@@ lin@@ ton was going to criticise the economic plat@@ form by Re@@ public@@ an D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p published on Monday about it &quot; only fav@@ ours mill@@ i@@ on@@ ai@@ res like him . &quot;
C@@ lin@@ ton has previously called tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s suggestion of a w@@ ha@@ cking tax cut to corpor@@ ation taxes &quot; his lo@@ oph@@ ole . &quot;
on Thursday , C@@ lin@@ ton emphasised that she her@@ self is a d@@ au@@ ghter of a small entrepren@@ e@@ ur .
she reminded the lis@@ ten@@ ers about small entrepreneur@@ s , whose invo@@ ices tr@@ um@@ p has left un@@ paid , and about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , tr@@ um@@ p himself f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ates in China and Mexico .
&quot; if he wants to make America great again , he should start by manufac@@ turing products in America himself , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton mo@@ cked .
this is what Rio &apos;s rat@@ ings look like : apparently the competition has@@ n &apos;@@ t managed to g@@ lu@@ e Finn@@ s to their scre@@ ens , but the mobile application is interesting
usually s@@ porting events are shown as shar@@ p pe@@ a@@ ks in television rat@@ ings .
so far , the Rio Olymp@@ ic g@@ ames ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t reached huge vie@@ wer rat@@ ings .
at a time the g@@ ames have g@@ lu@@ ed 12 per cent of the population to their scre@@ ens at its best : sw@@ im@@ ming on Y@@ le &apos;s Olymp@@ ic chan@@ nel , T@@ V@@ 2 , on Tu@@ es@@ day night was followed by 6@@ 15@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers .
for the sake of comparison : the European A@@ th@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships a month ago got almost 8@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers at a time , and U@@ E@@ F@@ A European Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships &quot; number was well over a million .
so far , the most interesting Olymp@@ ic sports have been cy@@ cl@@ ing on S@@ und@@ ay evening and artis@@ tic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics that opened the fifth game day . both of these reached almost half a million vie@@ w@@ ers at a time on the Olymp@@ ic chan@@ nel .
the head of Y@@ le Sport , P@@ an@@ u Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen , is satisfied with the rat@@ ings and notes that for the first time ever , the vie@@ w@@ ers are divided between several different dev@@ ices .
in addition to television , Finn@@ s follow the Olymp@@ ics from Rio A@@ re@@ ena .
we are satisfied with how many T@@ V vie@@ w@@ ers choose the Olymp@@ ics in the first place .
even on the television side , the vie@@ w@@ ers are divided between T@@ V@@ 2 and Y@@ le F@@ e@@ m channels .
Rio Olymp@@ ics is the first s@@ porting event Y@@ le has dedicated a whole chan@@ nel to .
when there is broad@@ cast 24 hours a day , and there are 20@@ ,@@ 000 to 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers all the time , it &apos;s a good basis .
the vie@@ wer rat@@ ings are lower than in London 20@@ 12 or Beij@@ ing 2008 , but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the Rio g@@ ames are broad@@ cast in Finland during the night time .
another reason for the ta@@ me interest - if someone thinks it &apos;s ta@@ me - surely is the traditional Finn@@ ish reason : if Finland had won a surprising med@@ al early on , the interest would &apos;@@ ve surely ju@@ mp@@ ed with it .
in addition , the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics is only just beginning , as well as other sports that interest Finn@@ s : sa@@ iling and rid@@ ing .
according to Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen , the rat@@ ings of the beginning were close to what was expected .
when the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics begin , the rat@@ ings explo@@ de .
Y@@ le launched a Y@@ le Rio 20@@ 16 mobile application for the g@@ ames , and during the first game days it became app@@ le A@@ P@@ P stor@@ e &apos;s most down@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed free application in Finland .
by Monday , the application had been down@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 15@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 times .
I gu@@ ess that now we &apos;@@ re some@@ where around 200@@ ,@@ 000 down@@ lo@@ ads .
&quot; we will get the on@@ line rat@@ ings only later , &quot; says Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen .
Rio A@@ re@@ ena has not worked as desired with all the users .
Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen says they &apos;@@ ve had feed@@ back and have managed to fi@@ x the bu@@ gs .
the use of Rio A@@ re@@ ena has included time la@@ g and other small , technical issues in the beginning .
there are now up@@ dated ver@@ sions of the applications that should fi@@ x these bu@@ gs .
Rio Olymp@@ ics have a wider cover@@ age on Y@@ le &apos;s channels and in A@@ re@@ ena than any other s@@ porting event ever before .
some sports can be followed on Y@@ le F@@ e@@ m chan@@ nel , and in Y@@ le P@@ u@@ he in radio broadcas@@ ts the g@@ ames daily .
in addition for the Olymp@@ ics being possible the most labor@@ ious ever for Y@@ le , they are also the last one that can be followed only from Y@@ le channels .
from the year 20@@ 18 on@@ wards Olymp@@ ic sports can be seen both on Y@@ le and on commercial channels .
how deep is Finland &apos;s deep@@ est la@@ ke ?
according to official statistics , the deep@@ est la@@ ke in Finland is P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne , it &apos;s depth being 9@@ 5@@ ,@@ 3 met@@ res at R@@ is@@ tin@@ sel@@ k@@ ä .
it might be even deep@@ er .
techni@@ que di@@ ving instruc@@ tor Mat@@ ti K@@ ann@@ ela found a h@@ oll@@ ow sized approximately 20 squ@@ are met@@ res from R@@ is@@ tis@@ el@@ k@@ ä , and the di@@ ving computer showed its bottom depth to be 10@@ 4 met@@ res .
in summer 20@@ 14 , Finn@@ ish Environment In@@ stitute attemp@@ ted to confirm the finding using ec@@ ho@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding , but it was in vain .
the method does not necessarily find a small h@@ oll@@ ow from a hundred met@@ res , says development engine@@ er J@@ ar@@ i Ha@@ k@@ al@@ a .
so for now the official depth is still 9@@ 5@@ ,@@ 3 met@@ res .
other deep la@@ kes include In@@ ari@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i ( 92 met@@ res ) and Su@@ vas@@ ves@@ i ( 90 met@@ res ) .
S@@ a@@ im@@ a@@ a , T@@ o@@ is@@ ves@@ i , and P@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i reach over 80 met@@ res .
they have not been stu@@ died as much as P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne .
especially In@@ ari@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i &apos;s bottom has not been carefully ma@@ pped .
&quot; there might well be some un@@ known de@@ p@@ ths , &quot; K@@ ann@@ ela pon@@ ders .
if the deep@@ est la@@ ke is defined by its average depth , it would be S@@ uu@@ ri Ju@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i , 23 met@@ res .
this way examined , P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne is not among the top ten of the deep@@ est , and Su@@ vas@@ ves@@ i is even far@@ ther from the top .
ed@@ ited 12 August 2.@@ 29 p@@ m : final paragraph ed@@ ited , because the deep@@ est la@@ kes by their average depth were wrong .
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen concerning tax reductions : pensioners &quot; taxation still har@@ der
pensioners &quot; taxation is still ti@@ ghter than the w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen says this dis@@ advantage emerged just before the general election , and it was promised the pensioners &quot; taxation would be made more equal compared to the w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners .
there is nothing like this in the Government &apos;s proposal .
we think it should definitely be there .
given promises should be kept after the election , he says to L@@ ä@@ n@@ n@@ en Media .
in the beginning of this year , w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners got income tax d@@ educ@@ tions that reduc@@ es the taxation .
the issue he@@ ated up the members of the opposition , who gri@@ ll@@ ed the then Minister of Fin@@ ance , A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der S@@ tu@@ b@@ b ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) , about the election promises .
purch@@ asing power secu@@ red , will not grow
according to I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen , the tax d@@ educ@@ tions in the definition of policy presented by the Minister of Fin@@ ance , P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ p@@ o ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) , are more about securing purch@@ ase power than increasing it , because wages will not be raised next year .
he says the tax d@@ educ@@ tion has a positive impact on purch@@ ase power and employment , if there are no other things that add to people &apos;s uncertainty .
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen is pleased with the Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä &apos;s ( Centre ) and Or@@ p@@ o &apos;s messages about the will to respect the hard@@ -@@ won competitiveness pact .
he says adher@@ ing to the pact is important credi@@ bil@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ wise .
it is the most important action in both economic and employment policies .
it is done jointly with the labour market organisations , so it should not be spo@@ iled by challeng@@ ing it .
it is necessary , because the economy reli@@ es so much on the domestic demand and on people &apos;s own optimis@@ m about the future .
pro@@ long@@ ed unemployment must be discussed in the government budget session
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen appe@@ als to the Government to discuss long@@ -@@ term unemployment in its budget session , at least to stop its increase .
in June , there were 17@@ ,@@ 000 more long@@ -@@ term unemployed people than a year before .
he says that if this growth will not stop , the Government &apos;s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will be lost .
he war@@ ns that if the challenge posed by pro@@ long@@ ed unemployment is over@@ looked , it will mean a very large soci@@ e@@ tal bill .
Am@@ b@@ assa@@ dor : no known Finn@@ ish victims in the T@@ ha@@ il@@ and attacks
the bom@@ b attacks in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and that happened during last evening and night ( C@@ E@@ T ) killed at least four people .
the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y advis@@ es all the Finn@@ ish people in the country to be wat@@ ch@@ ful and to avoid the bu@@ si@@ est touris@@ t areas , and to follow the authorities &quot; direc@@ tions .
those Finn@@ ish touris@@ ts that are planning to travel to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and should not canc@@ el their jour@@ ney because of the explo@@ sions , but they should follow the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y &apos;s advice about cau@@ tion , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
very few Finn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and
according to W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en , currently there are very few Finn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate .
Finn@@ s &quot; travelling se@@ as@@ on to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and takes place around turn of the year .
most trav@@ ell@@ ers to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and this time of year come from Sou@@ thern Europe and China .
after the bom@@ b attacks , the Finn@@ ish E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y has got some comments via F@@ ace@@ book from Finn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y has attemp@@ ted to contact especially those Finn@@ s that are in H@@ ua H@@ in , in order to get information about the town &apos;s situation .
however , several of our contacts in H@@ ua H@@ in are currently out of town .
generally speaking everything seems to be fine , W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en says .
no information about the responsible party
according to W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en , there is no information about who is responsible for the attack .
the amb@@ assa@@ dor thinks the incidents may be connected to the political un@@ rest in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s dis@@ united society , and to the referendum last week about the constitution drawn up by the military jun@@ ta .
the law passed in the referendum .
the referendum was not an open , democratic process .
in the country people got for example arrested , when they had declared that they oppose the law .
as for the Sou@@ thern prov@@ inc@@ es in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , there sm@@ oul@@ ders an eth@@ n@@ ic@@ -@@ ra@@ cial conflict related to the Mus@@ li@@ m population , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
the Mus@@ lim@@ s want to increase their autonomy .
however , there has not been any earlier attacks to touris@@ t attrac@@ tions .
there was a big , local f@@ esti@@ val day in B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k today , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
according to her , the city is celeb@@ rating the Qu@@ een &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day and mo@@ thers &quot; D@@ ay .
there is@@ n &apos;@@ t a lot of traffic in the city .
the attack most likely have such an effect on the daily rou@@ tin@@ es that the authorities will be very strict about security .
T@@ ha@@ il@@ and police : the attacks are not international terrorism
according to the police , the attacks are &quot; local sa@@ bo@@ tage &quot; and differ from custom@@ ary terrorist attacks .
also Islamic terrorism has been rul@@ ed out , T@@ ha@@ il@@ and police report according to the news agency A@@ P .
at least four people have died in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and during 24 hours , as 11 bom@@ bs have explo@@ ded around the country , like for example in touris@@ t fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes P@@ hu@@ ket and H@@ ua H@@ in .
there were four bom@@ bs that explo@@ ded in a touris@@ t attrac@@ tion also favoured by the Finn@@ s , on holid@@ ay island P@@ hu@@ ket , reports T@@ ha@@ i newspaper B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k P@@ ost .
according to current information , they did not claim any lives .
the paper says two of the bom@@ bs explo@@ ded on Pat@@ ong B@@ each .
in addition , two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded in P@@ han@@ g N@@ g@@ a , where one person was w@@ ounded , according to the paper .
in a popular touris@@ t attrac@@ tion , H@@ ua H@@ in , the local authorities report that a total of four bom@@ bs has explo@@ ded yesterday and today .
both double bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least one .
furthermore , at least one bom@@ b explo@@ ded in both the vill@@ age of S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i and the city of T@@ ran@@ g in Sou@@ th@@ -@@ T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
both bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least one .
also S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i is familiar to many a trav@@ ell@@ er , since the way to K@@ o Sa@@ mu@@ i , K@@ o P@@ ha N@@ gan , and K@@ o T@@ A@@ O holid@@ ay islands goes through it .
the quar@@ ter responsible for the attacks is not known
according to P@@ ra@@ y@@ ut Chan@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ Ch@@ a , head of the military jun@@ ta ruling T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , the quar@@ ter responsible for the attacks is so far not known .
the bom@@ bs are an attempt to create cha@@ os and confusion .
we should not sti@@ r up any more pan@@ ic in the people , he said to the journalists .
according to Gen@@ . P@@ ra@@ w@@ it W@@ ong@@ su@@ wan , De@@ pu@@ ty Prime Minister in charge of security , at least the H@@ ua H@@ in and T@@ ran@@ g attacks are linked .
he said to T@@ ha@@ i B@@ S@@ B that the off@@ end@@ ers &quot; purpose has been to destroy the tourism in the country , since all the attacks happened in touris@@ t attrac@@ tions .
the Finn@@ ish E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y advis@@ es all the Finn@@ ish people in the country to be wat@@ ch@@ ful and to avoid the bu@@ si@@ est touris@@ t areas , and to follow the authorities &quot; direc@@ tions .
those Finn@@ s that are planning to travel to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and should not canc@@ el their jour@@ ney because of the explo@@ sions , but they should follow the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y &apos;s advice about cau@@ tion , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
Europeans among the w@@ ounded
so far , there is very little information about the attacks that happened during the Finn@@ ish night time or their victims .
a little more information has been received from the yesterday evening &apos;s attack in H@@ ua H@@ in .
a local woman died and over 20 others were in@@ ju@@ red in it , and among the w@@ ounded there were at least nine foreign touris@@ ts .
there are at least German , Italian , Dutch , and Austrian people among the w@@ ounded .
at least three people were w@@ ounded in the second H@@ ua H@@ in attack .

B@@ il@@ es from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . won the women &apos;s all@@ -@@ around
A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra R@@ ais@@ man from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . was the second with a sc@@ ore of 6@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 98 , and Russia &apos;s A@@ li@@ ja M@@ usta@@ fin@@ a was the third with her sc@@ ore of 5@@ 8@@ .@@ 6@@ 65 points .
B@@ il@@ es , 18 , is still stri@@ ving for g@@ old in floor , va@@ ult , and balance be@@ am in the Rio Olymp@@ ics .
B@@ il@@ es has domin@@ ated women &apos;s g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics at will during the last years .

a Finn@@ ish entrepren@@ e@@ ur in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and : &quot; the attack has no effect on tourism &quot;
ES@@ A H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , who runs a real es@@ ta@@ te agency and a children &apos;s play clu@@ b in the same premis@@ es in P@@ hu@@ ket , is not worried about the effect the T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s bom@@ b attacks have on tourism .
if there are no more attacks , I believe nothing much will follow from this , estimates H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , a Finn@@ ish entrepren@@ e@@ ur who has worked in Asia about two decades .
the experienced entrepren@@ e@@ ur has seen many traged@@ ies in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and close up .
there is always something here .
first a t@@ su@@ na@@ mi , then the bir@@ d f@@ l@@ u , and last year a bom@@ b attack in B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k .
if these earlier ones d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t ch@@ ase the touris@@ ts away , I doubt this will , either .
H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a &apos;s company offices are located a few hundred met@@ res from the bom@@ b attack sc@@ ene .
H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a heard about the attack from his own employe@@ e .
the employe@@ e called him about nine o &apos;@@ c@@ lock local time and said he should not come to the office .
H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a says that both the pro@@ men@@ ade and the main stre@@ et , B@@ ang@@ la Ro@@ ad , were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks .
many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning .
they thought the road bloc@@ ks were set up because of the Qu@@ een &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day , H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a says referring to Friday &apos;s holid@@ ay in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
at Pat@@ ong , the atmosphere was cal@@ m , and the businesses on the main stre@@ et were allowed to open at around 10 local time .
at the be@@ ach , many of the people ha@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even heard about the attacks .
around 2@@ .30 in the afternoon T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s time , the traffic at Pat@@ ong had returned to normal , and most of the sh@@ ops had opened their doors .
based on the attack place , the explo@@ sion was relatively small , says H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , who went to see the attack place .
later the car in question was sp@@ ot@@ ted in J@@ ou@@ x@@ hol@@ min@@ tie , K@@ r@@ uu@@ n@@ up@@ y@@ y .
when the police reached the place , the car was set on fire .
the pat@@ ro@@ l saw two men that fit the descri@@ p@@ tions hid@@ ing in a ne@@ ar@@ by s@@ pr@@ u@@ ce cop@@ se .
one of the men was immediately caught .
the other made a run for it , but was later found from the forest with the help of a police do@@ g .
the men are sus@@ pected to be guilty of ste@@ aling of a motor vehicle for temporary use , the@@ ft , and gross damage .
the police thanks all those who gave ti@@ p@@ -@@ off@@ s .
Direc@@ tor of Research about changes in Russian leadership : clearly a move aside
on Friday Russia had its most hi@@ gh@@ -@@ ran@@ king leadership change in years , as President V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir Putin removed his Chi@@ ef of Sta@@ ff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ ov .
I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s success@@ or is a 4@@ 4@@ -@@ year old An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o of Es@@ ton@@ ian background .
he is an ex@@ -@@ diplom@@ at and has been I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ty .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o says that a reason behind I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al can be Putin &apos;s will to prevent strong people around him of gather@@ ing too much power .
he ad@@ ds that ro@@ ta@@ ting leadership tasks is one way of using power .
this is a way to prevent people from increasing their power independent of the President .
according to K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o , it is also possible that I@@ van@@ ov has been in trouble with other leaders or that he has b@@ l@@ under@@ ed .
a drop in status for I@@ van@@ ov
I@@ van@@ ov , who has been part of Putin &apos;s inner circ@@ le , is now trans@@ fer@@ ring to be the ec@@ ology and transport special representative .
on a ta@@ pe presented by the state media Putin said the change was a mutual decision .
Putin said that I@@ van@@ ov himself had requested a transfer to another role , and had proposed V@@ ain@@ o as a candidate for his position , reported Russia T@@ od@@ ay .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o says that from I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s point of view , this is a clear drop in status .
ecological or transport matters do not have a very high priority in Russia .
he points out that I@@ van@@ ov has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power .
in addition , I@@ van@@ ov has had a significant role in the president &apos;s Security Council .
during Soviet times , I@@ van@@ ov worked at K@@ G@@ B together with Putin .
he was considered as Putin &apos;s possible success@@ or in 2008 , but D@@ mit@@ ri Med@@ ved@@ e@@ v became the president .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o points out that the old guard , for example the govern@@ ors , has been recently replaced in Russia .
senior Research fellow K@@ at@@ ri P@@ y@@ n@@ n@@ ö@@ ni@@ em@@ i from the Finn@@ ish In@@ stitute of International Affairs says that the fact that Putin is re@@ placing his inner circ@@ le with youn@@ ger people is more interesting than who is I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s success@@ or .
IS@@ IS fi@@ gh@@ ters used civilians as human shi@@ el@@ ds while re@@ tre@@ ating in Syria
they used the civilians as human shi@@ el@@ ds as they with@@ drew to J@@ ar@@ ab@@ u@@ lu@@ s , thus preventing us from tar@@ geting them , said S@@ her@@ f@@ an D@@ ar@@ wish , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Man@@ bi@@ j M@@ ili@@ tary Council .
the Sy@@ rian Ob@@ serva@@ tory for Human Rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars , where they were taken to J@@ ar@@ ab@@ u@@ lu@@ s .
the Arab and Kur@@ d fi@@ gh@@ ters managed to seiz@@ e 90 per cent of the Man@@ bi@@ j town that was important for IS@@ IS .
it is estimated , though , that do@@ z@@ ens of j@@ i@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts remained in the town then .
earlier news ed@@ ited at 7@@ .30 p@@ m : earlier we mis@@ ta@@ ken@@ ly told that the civilians are fle@@ eing the town , as it really was the IS@@ IS fi@@ gh@@ ters who kid@@ na@@ pped the civilians while fle@@ eing the town .
Pro@@ f@@ essor : the Minis@@ try of the I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or &apos;s definition of document access policy is un@@ law@@ ful
the Minis@@ try of the I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or &apos;s definition of document access policy is un@@ law@@ ful , says prof@@ essor of public law , T@@ om@@ i V@@ ou@@ tila@@ inen , from the Uni@@ versity of Eastern Finland .
V@@ ou@@ tila@@ inen says to ST@@ T that document access cannot be based on an official &apos;s own policies , but it is based on law .
earlier the Minis@@ try of the I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or refused to sur@@ r@@ ender the partici@@ pan@@ t list of the Minister of I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or &apos;s events to I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at .
the Minister justified his decision with the instruc@@ tions by the Prime Minister &apos;s Office and with the fact that the information was entered in the Minister &apos;s cal@@ end@@ ar , not in the accounting material .
the Chi@@ ef Commun@@ ications O@@ ffic@@ er of the Minis@@ try says to ST@@ T that the need of reforming the practices has been remar@@ ked in the Minis@@ try .
U@@ sa@@ in b@@ ol@@ t &apos;s final Olymp@@ ic show beg@@ ins in Rio
like in recent years , before el@@ ite compet@@ itions , b@@ ol@@ t has been running against time .
early in the se@@ as@@ on , he hur@@ t his back thi@@ gh , and had to pass Olymp@@ ic qualifications in J@@ ama@@ ic@@ a .
it has not been the perfect buil@@ d@@ -@@ up but I am in much better shape
I &apos;@@ ve been training well , and that &apos;s the key thing , b@@ ol@@ t said in his press conference in Rio .
that press conference included s@@ can@@ ti@@ ly cla@@ d S@@ amb@@ a d@@ an@@ c@@ ers and re@@ por@@ ters that had turned into f@@ ans .
the mur@@ mur@@ ing around b@@ ol@@ t under@@ lines that fact that the sta@@ r of the J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an has r@@ isen during the age when a@@ th@@ le@@ tics has strugg@@ led with dop@@ ing scand@@ als and sl@@ id@@ ing interest .
b@@ ol@@ t previous de@@ fe@@ at in Olymp@@ ic g@@ ames was in A@@ th@@ ens 2004 , when he was elimin@@ ated in 200 met@@ res pre@@ l@@ imin@@ aries with a time of 2@@ 1@@ ,@@ 05 .
back then b@@ ol@@ t , aged 17 , was a young promise slow@@ ed down by in@@ j@@ uri@@ es and la@@ x attitude towards prac@@ tising .
four years later in Beij@@ ing , he started his re@@ ign on the hundred met@@ res , when he cr@@ us@@ hed the world record and the compet@@ itors &quot; sel@@ f@@ -@@ confidence with a time of 9@@ ,@@ 69 , reached despite the final celeb@@ rations .
this is har@@ der
a year later in the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship in Berlin , b@@ ol@@ t reached the cul@@ min@@ ation of his career when measured with time .
the world rec@@ ords from Berlin , 9@@ ,@@ 58 for hundred met@@ res and 19@@ ,@@ 19 for two hundred , are still valid .
b@@ ol@@ t has announced that in Rio his goals are the world record for 200 met@@ res and going under 19 secon@@ ds , but no one believes this besides b@@ ol@@ t himself .
on 1@@ 00@@ m b@@ ol@@ t &apos;s biggest challeng@@ er is J@@ us@@ tin G@@ at@@ l@@ in , who one Olymp@@ ic g@@ old in A@@ th@@ ens 2004 for this distance .
last year in Beij@@ ing W@@ C fin@@ als b@@ ol@@ t won the American by only one h@@ und@@ red@@ th of a second .
during his re@@ ign that began in Beij@@ ing , b@@ ol@@ t has not lost once in an el@@ ite competition fin@@ als , if only he has managed to start .
in Da@@ eg@@ u 20@@ 11 , b@@ ol@@ t did not run in the 1@@ 00@@ m W@@ C fin@@ als because of a false start .
in bit over a week , b@@ ol@@ t will be 30 .
he is an old man in young men &apos;s sport , and Rio g@@ ames are his final Olymp@@ ics .
b@@ ol@@ t has set the final finish line for his career to be next year &apos;s W@@ C g@@ ames in London .
these are the Olymp@@ ics that separate me from the pac@@ k .
I &apos;@@ m older now , and it &apos;s har@@ der for me .
but an@@ y@@ time I start feeling really down , I remind myself , you have got to get this done this year , b@@ ol@@ t said three months ago in a S@@ ports illustra@@ ted inter@@ view .

7 cu@@ ri@@ ous things that , according to science , pro@@ long your life
science has stu@@ died everything possible between the heav@@ en and the ear@@ th .
these things have been proven to bring extra years to a person &apos;s life .
some of these thing are hab@@ its that , either directly or indirectly , will affect a person &apos;s health in a way that pro@@ long@@ s their life .
sometimes the things a person can &apos;@@ t influence themselves can bring them extra years .
these are for example tendency towards ab@@ domin@@ al ob@@ es@@ ity or social status .
going sh@@ opp@@ ing regularly can pro@@ long your life .
it &apos;s not always even necessary to spend - just pic@@ king up a car@@ ton of milk is enough .
there are many studies that have aimed at dis@@ covering the secret behind long age .
medical Da@@ ily presented seven of the most pec@@ uli@@ ar research results .
according to science , all of these things may bring you more years for your life .
drinking be@@ er and co@@ ff@@ ee
drinking co@@ ff@@ ee has been shown to provide a protec@@ tive effect against certain canc@@ ers , type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , as well as Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and Par@@ k@@ ins@@ on &apos;s disease .
according to the study by Har@@ var@@ d Uni@@ versity , moder@@ ate co@@ ff@@ ee consumption was linked to a &quot; lower risk of death , &quot; especially from heart and ne@@ uro@@ logical diseases .
as for alcohol , there are studies that say drinking a moder@@ ate amount of one to three drin@@ ks a day may pro@@ long your life .
for example , one study found w@@ ine drin@@ kers were more likely to out@@ live those who did not drin@@ k at all .
regular f@@ los@@ sing can possibly add more than six years to a person &apos;s life , according to a research .
the claim is based on the fact this preven@@ ts inf@@ la@@ med gu@@ ms .
these in turn can lead to increase in the risk of developing other diseases throughout the body .
a study conducted in Nor@@ way found out how lau@@ gh@@ ing affects your lif@@ es@@ pan .
a s@@ even@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ project trac@@ ked over 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 people .
those who lau@@ gh@@ ed more were 35 per cent more likely to still be ali@@ ve at the end of the study .
sex , when the protection against ST@@ D@@ s is taken into consideration , is good for your health according to many studies .
in addition , it can also add years to your life .
unfortunately , just having sex as it is , is not enough .
in order for a person to gain extra years to their life , they also need to cl@@ im@@ a@@ x .
being physi@@ cally active sure brings extra years , there &apos;s no den@@ ying that .
however , long life do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t necessarily require absolute le@@ ann@@ ess .
a study from O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity found out that women with a big@@ ger bac@@ k@@ si@@ de ten@@ ded to have lower levels of ch@@ oles@@ te@@ ro@@ l .
they also had higher levels of om@@ eg@@ a@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ ids in their system .
the same study connected these things to an overall lower risk of mor@@ tality .
whether it &apos;s a person who ear@@ ned a med@@ al in the Olymp@@ ics or an ac@@ tor who won an O@@ sc@@ ar , they are more likely to live longer than your average man .
many studies have attemp@@ ted to find a reason for the phenomenon .
one explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that brings extra years to their life .
some researchers spec@@ ula@@ te that long life is caused by the person &apos;s social status - which for its part enables the pursu@@ it of acc@@ ol@@ ades such as the No@@ bel pri@@ ze .
a study of sh@@ opp@@ ing behaviour of people ages 65 and older found that a person who goes sh@@ opp@@ ing every day is more likely to live longer than someone who sh@@ ops less .
this is because going to a concrete sho@@ p reduc@@ es l@@ on@@ elin@@ ess .
that , on its turn , has been shown to tri@@ gg@@ er biological changes that may lead to an early death .
so put down that credit card - on@@ line sh@@ opp@@ ing does not have the same effect .
a totally d@@ run@@ k dri@@ ver sw@@ er@@ ved against a lor@@ ry
a serious head@@ -@@ on coll@@ ision between a lor@@ ry and car took place on Friday evening at K@@ os@@ ki , Finland proper .
the accident took place at K@@ os@@ ki , hal@@ f@@ way between K@@ os@@ ken@@ tie and S@@ or@@ vas@@ ton@@ tie , on Friday at 9 p@@ m .

the wish of the family of the woman murder@@ ed in L@@ o@@ vi@@ is@@ a : all the possible don@@ ations for police do@@ gs
the family of the 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year old woman murder@@ ed a week ago in L@@ o@@ vi@@ is@@ a wish that instead of flo@@ w@@ ers and prin@@ ted forms of cond@@ ol@@ ences , people would make a don@@ ation for police do@@ g work .
the V@@ e@@ terinary c@@ lin@@ ic of S@@ i@@ po@@ o pos@@ ted a F@@ ace@@ book update rela@@ ying the victim &apos;s family &apos;s wish about the don@@ ations for police do@@ gs .
the post says the victim had worked as a tem@@ p at the V@@ e@@ terinary c@@ lin@@ ic of S@@ i@@ po@@ o , and that she had also worked there for her nur@@ se training .
the c@@ lin@@ ic re@@ members the woman with tou@@ ching words .
happy , s@@ mar@@ t , a good sense of hu@@ m@@ our , not afraid of work .
a good friend .
we still can &apos;@@ t fully comprehen@@ d that she &apos;s gone .
the F@@ ace@@ book post contains an account number where the don@@ ations can be transferred .
the status update men@@ tions that all the don@@ ated money goes entirely to police do@@ gs , mainly for purch@@ asing body arm@@ our ves@@ ts .
last Friday a 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year old woman from L@@ o@@ vi@@ is@@ a was murder@@ ed on her own home y@@ ard in K@@ os@@ ken@@ ky@@ l@@ ä , L@@ o@@ vi@@ is@@ a .
the woman &apos;s neighbours told I@@ l@@ ta@@ le@@ h@@ ti she was very f@@ ond of animals .
she had several animals , among others a hor@@ se , do@@ gs , c@@ ats , ch@@ ic@@ ken , and a co@@ ck .
the 27@@ -@@ year old man sus@@ pected for the murder did not know the woman , and they had no connection to one another .
a police do@@ g Bö@@ r@@ j@@ e was involved in the trac@@ king of the murder@@ er , and the do@@ g was seriously in@@ ju@@ red during the making of the arrest .
Bö@@ r@@ j@@ e did live , though , and it is getting better .
a Dis@@ tric@@ t Court senten@@ ced P@@ os@@ ti for commit@@ ting a breach of the An@@ ti@@ -@@ Dis@@ crimin@@ ation Act
P@@ os@@ ti had no right to keep the wages of an employe@@ e who dec@@ lined to give workplace initi@@ ation to an agency contract wor@@ ker , estimated the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court of Ta@@ vas@@ tia proper in its sentence .
the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court en@@ joined P@@ os@@ ti to pay the employe@@ e most of the re@@ tained wages and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination .
according to the sentence , P@@ os@@ ti could have re@@ tained just that part of the initi@@ ator &apos;s wages that was equal to the initi@@ ation part of the whole day &apos;s work .
the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court said the employe@@ e had been , against the An@@ ti@@ -@@ Dis@@ crimin@@ ation Act , placed in an un@@ favourable position based on their trade uni@@ on@@ ism .
the employe@@ e had followed the Finn@@ ish P@@ ost and log@@ is@@ tics Union Pa@@ u &apos;s union decision about workplace initi@@ ation ban .
during the postal strike in November last year , Pa@@ u made a decision according to which P@@ os@@ ti &apos;s employees will not initi@@ ate agency contract workers that break the strike .
the first to report the matter was K@@ ans@@ an U@@ ut@@ is@@ et .

B@@ B@@ C : man United &apos;s big signing suspended - he won &apos;@@ t be in the first match of the P@@ re@@ mi@@ er L@@ eag@@ ue
football sign@@ ings &quot; wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ record man won &apos;@@ t be seen on the field , when the English P@@ re@@ mi@@ er L@@ eag@@ ue will begin this weekend .
P@@ aul P@@ og@@ ba &apos;s sus@@ pension followed him to England .
Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United &apos;s big signing P@@ aul P@@ og@@ ba is suspended for his M@@ an United &apos;s first P@@ re@@ mi@@ er L@@ eag@@ ue match of the se@@ as@@ on against B@@ our@@ n@@ em@@ ou@@ th , B@@ B@@ C said on Friday .
according to British media , M@@ an United paid 10@@ 5 million euros for P@@ og@@ ba to Italian team Ju@@ ven@@ tus .
the English F@@ o@@ ot@@ ball Association F@@ A is keeping him from the game , because P@@ og@@ ba got a sus@@ pension in Ju@@ ven@@ tus .
he got two y@@ ell@@ ow cards in last se@@ as@@ on &apos;s C@@ op@@ pa Itali@@ a , and that results in a one game ban .
this ban has carried over to England , F@@ A told the B@@ B@@ C .
P@@ og@@ ba &apos;s next possibility to play is on the second round of the L@@ eag@@ ue on August 19 , when M@@ an United plays against Sou@@ th@@ amp@@ ton .
at F@@ low , me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ an@@ ia is a vir@@ tue
the precise criteria of enjo@@ yment and ambitious v@@ isions have established the status of F@@ low F@@ esti@@ val as an internationally respected event star@@ red by the top artis@@ ts in the world .
flow F@@ esti@@ val beg@@ ins on Friday in Helsinki .
the f@@ esti@@ val gu@@ es@@ ts have typ@@ ically expressed themselves with individual d@@ res@@ sing .
one of the main stage artis@@ ts this year is the pun@@ k leg@@ end I@@ g@@ gy P@@ o@@ p .
the F@@ low F@@ esti@@ val event area is sty@@ led with for example artific@@ ial tur@@ f and art installations .
for us , it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a be@@ er tent , says the artis@@ tic Direc@@ tor of the event , Tu@@ om@@ as K@@ all@@ io .
flow F@@ esti@@ val , organised in Su@@ vi@@ la@@ h@@ ti , Helsinki , this weekend , has grown from a small block f@@ esti@@ val to an event with tens of thousands vis@@ itors .
behind the success , there is a simple question : what kind of an event would the organis@@ ers themselves want to attend ?
thinking this way is quite exceptional in event production .
most of the time the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act according to the authorities &quot; orders , says artis@@ tic Direc@@ tor Tu@@ om@@ as K@@ all@@ io .
a week before the event he knew , that F@@ low will sell out also this year .
the goal has been to increase the last year &apos;s number of vis@@ itors , 7@@ 0.@@ 000 , by 5@@ .000 people .
there will be a group of interesting domestic and foreign artis@@ ts at the f@@ esti@@ val also this year .
the growth of the vis@@ itor number is a good thing , because the operations have to funded some@@ way .
on the other hand , we don &apos;@@ t want to grow too much , because at some point the m@@ asses would be like cattle that is her@@ ded in huge channels .
we don &apos;@@ t want that .
during 13 years , the ide@@ ology of a successful event has been mag@@ ni@@ fied in a way that the area , partly dec@@ or@@ ated with artific@@ ial tur@@ f , hos@@ ts 1@@ 30 per@@ form@@ ers , art installations , and a number of res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant points and co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il b@@ ars .
in addition to the main stage and the smaller stages , this year there will be gi@@ gs in a tent accommod@@ ating 15@@ .000 people .
K@@ all@@ io ad@@ mits that the event could be implemented also in a simp@@ ler way .
I may be a bit me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c , but at the same time , we have managed to retain the F@@ low spirit .
if you lose it , this is no longer our thing .
for K@@ all@@ io , the greatest jo@@ y and re@@ ward for the work done is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays even big v@@ isions are practically possible .
in the early years of the event , mid 00@@ s , the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20@@ .000 euros from the city of Helsinki .
last year the tur@@ no@@ ver of the limited company that manag@@ es F@@ low was about six million euros .
with it , it &apos;s possible to create &quot; even cra@@ z@@ y things , &quot; like building that tent 73 me@@ ters wide .
the gu@@ es@@ ts at F@@ low have typ@@ ically expressed themselves with individual d@@ res@@ sing .
in addition to a musi@@ c event , one can also call this a community of tr@@ end@@ y young ad@@ ul@@ ts .
however , the event has not pur@@ pos@@ ely prof@@ iled itself as especially fashi@@ on@@ able .
above all , we want to stand out because of our content .
still , also FA@@ D@@ s fit in to F@@ low &apos;s set of values : cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and the desire to interac@@ t with the environment , says K@@ all@@ io .
this year one of the main stage artis@@ ts is a leg@@ end of pun@@ k , 69 years old I@@ g@@ gy P@@ o@@ p .
in his own gen@@ re , the man has a huge f@@ an cro@@ w@@ d , but he is@@ n &apos;@@ t the most typical per@@ former in a f@@ esti@@ val comb@@ ining in@@ die ro@@ ck , po@@ p musi@@ c , ra@@ p , and sou@@ l .
according to K@@ all@@ io I@@ g@@ gy was bo@@ ok@@ ed , since this is most likely the last time the artis@@ t is gi@@ gging in Finland .
we are interested in everything , history and future .
not just what is played in commercial radio .
I@@ g@@ gy &apos;s latest al@@ bu@@ m was blo@@ ody good , and he has per@@ formed blo@@ ody well on his gi@@ gs in recent years .
the bom@@ bs in T@@ ha@@ i touris@@ t parad@@ ise were hid@@ den in flo@@ wer po@@ ts - hor@@ ri@@ fied touris@@ ts escap@@ ed
on Thursday evening local time , two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded in H@@ ua H@@ in .
at least one local woman died and over 20 were w@@ ounded in the attack .
the bom@@ bs were probably hid@@ den in a flo@@ wer po@@ t and then det@@ on@@ ated using cel@@ l p@@ hon@@ es .
the bom@@ bs were located on a stre@@ et where most of the customers are foreign .
they went off at the same time as the touris@@ ts began to leave the b@@ ars to go back to their ho@@ tel@@ s , said a police spo@@ kes@@ man Sa@@ mo@@ er Y@@ o@@ os@@ um@@ ran according to C@@ N@@ N .
a w@@ il@@ d@@ life protection@@ ist E@@ win Wi@@ ek , who has li@@ ved in Asia since 1989 , tw@@ e@@ e@@ ted a reve@@ aling image about the attacks .
if the tw@@ eet is@@ n &apos;@@ t visible , you can see it here .
at least 11 of those w@@ ounded in H@@ ua H@@ in were foreign touris@@ ts .
people were running towards me saying that a bom@@ b has explo@@ ded near the b@@ ars .
it happened on one of the biggest b@@ ar stre@@ ets , said Swedish touris@@ t E@@ m@@ eli@@ e Ol@@ sson to A@@ f@@ ton@@ bla@@ d@@ et .
in the next morning local time two bom@@ bs went off in S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i .
at least one died .
the number of the w@@ ounded is not yet known .
very soon after this , two bom@@ bs went off on the island of P@@ hu@@ ket that is popular also among Finn@@ s .
as far as is known , nobody died .
at the same time there was another double bom@@ bing in H@@ ua H@@ in .
at least one died and three were w@@ ounded .
in addition , one bom@@ b went off in the town of T@@ ran@@ g .
the police said they had found at least one bom@@ b from H@@ ua H@@ in that had not yet explo@@ ded .
according to the T@@ ha@@ i authorities , those responsible for the bom@@ b attacks are most likely re@@ bel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s military leadership .
the local authorities estimate a criminal organisation might also be the cul@@ pri@@ t .
according to A@@ f@@ ton@@ bla@@ d@@ et , the police has la@@ tely been s@@ na@@ pping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking .
K@@ S@@ M@@ L : this part of the new read@@ iness units are the first to go into battle in war situations
in an acu@@ te war situation , the con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts won &apos;@@ t be sent to battle until several months after they have s@@ wor@@ n their o@@ ath , says K@@ es@@ k@@ is@@ u@@ om@@ ala@@ inen .
the newspaper inter@@ viewed the Chi@@ ef of Education of the Finn@@ ish Defence For@@ ces , Bri@@ g@@ ad@@ i@@ er General Ju@@ k@@ ka S@@ onn@@ inen , who said that for example from those con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts that serve 5@@ ,@@ 5 months only those are effective who are fin@@ ishing their training .
according to the Chi@@ ef of Education , the first ones to be called up are those reser@@ vis@@ ts who are part of the read@@ iness units .
no con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts or reser@@ vis@@ ts are called up to a duty they do not have the required training for , says S@@ onn@@ inen .
earlier in the summer it was found out that the Finn@@ ish Defence forces begin to train con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts to read@@ iness units from the beginning of the next year .
the units can be used in military operations already during the con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t training , if necessary .
P@@ am@@ ela T@@ ol@@ a got gi@@ ant in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication for a m@@ oul@@ dy home
ac@@ t@@ ress P@@ am@@ ela T@@ ol@@ a and her ex@@ -@@ h@@ us@@ b@@ and , C@@ E@@ O Paul@@ i W@@ ar@@ oma , have won a hard argument about a house they b@@ ought from Es@@ po@@ o in 200@@ 9 .
the purch@@ ase price of a tw@@ o@@ -@@ sto@@ re@@ y deta@@ ched house had been 3@@ 30@@ ,@@ 000 euros .
after the closing of the deal , a serious mo@@ is@@ tu@@ re problem was revealed in the house , causing un@@ healthy mic@@ ro@@ be growth .
the couple had to sell the house to be dem@@ ol@@ ished in 20@@ 14 .
the price had dro@@ pped to 13@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 euros , so T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma &apos;s financial loss was no less than 198@@ ,@@ 000 euros .
the couple f@@ iled the matter in court and there claimed a price reduction from the sell@@ er .
the sell@@ er con@@ tested the claim , but T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma won the case in both the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court and the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al .
the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al passed judgement on the matter on Wednesday .
it re@@ tained in force the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court judgement by which the sell@@ er was imposed to pay a price reduction of 15@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euros to T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma .
in addition , the sell@@ er has to cover the couple &apos;s legal and settlement costs for a total of 4@@ 7@@ ,@@ 000 euros .
the price reduction was made slightly equ@@ itable by the court , since bu@@ yers did know some of the house &apos;s needs for re@@ pa@@ irs when they were bu@@ ying the home .
however , according to the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als , the construction def@@ ec@@ ts that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented .
T@@ ol@@ a was looking for a house in good condition
at the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al T@@ ol@@ a told that the couple had been specifically looking for a home in good condition , since they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t want to do re@@ pair work .
she had formed an understanding that the building had been ren@@ o@@ vated and was in good condition , and that there would be no dis@@ advantages from the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report .
the risks and def@@ ec@@ ts mentioned in the condition inspection report were ven@@ tila@@ tion and that the management of ra@@ in and mel@@ t waters running along the ro@@ ck sur@@ face was not sufficient .
based on the discussions it was@@ n &apos;@@ t however revealed that this would be an urgent matter at all .
T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma had the impression that the ra@@ in waters from the ro@@ ck should probably be slightly directed within a couple of years .
the deal was closed in October 200@@ 9 .
within a few years it appeared that the hu@@ mid@@ ity problems of the house were much more serious than previously thought .
in inspections in 20@@ 12 and 20@@ 13 , mic@@ ro@@ be growth was found from the building . according to witn@@ esses , this was caused both by the ro@@ ck ra@@ in waters and ear@@ th hu@@ mid@@ ity that had r@@ isen to the sur@@ face by cap@@ ill@@ ary action .
according to the inspec@@ tor &apos;s evaluation , on the west side of the house mic@@ ro@@ be@@ -@@ inf@@ es@@ ted air could also enter to the inside of the house through the por@@ ch .
m@@ ou@@ ld or ye@@ ast that enables a health risk and exc@@ eed@@ s the limit values was found in s@@ me@@ ar sa@@ mp@@ les taken from the u@@ til@@ ity room , bas@@ ement sta@@ ir@@ case , living room b@@ ay win@@ dow , and bas@@ ement w@@ ash@@ room .
the pati@@ os were built without permits .
there was also argument in the court about whether the house had been extended against the building permit .
the court held that before closing of the deal , T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma were not aware of the Es@@ po@@ o city decision that there had been changes to the house that were against the permit .
for example the pati@@ os had been built even though there were no proper permits yet .
however , the m@@ ou@@ ld problems were the crucial matter at court .
according to the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al , based on the information they got from the sell@@ er before the deal , the bu@@ yers had reason to assume that the building was suitable for living as is , and that there was no need for large re@@ pa@@ irs in the near future .
in the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al &apos;s opinion , T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma had no special reason to conduct an un@@ usually extensive inspection .
the bu@@ yers have not neglec@@ ted their duty to investigate , stated the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al in its decision .
a sp@@ ine@@ -@@ ch@@ ill@@ ing find from the arch@@ iv@@ es : hundreds of thousands of women wanted to bear children for the Na@@ z@@ is - the register also includes Finn@@ s
journ@@ alist Ch@@ ris@@ top@@ her Ander@@ sson descri@@ bes in his recent article in D@@ ag@@ ens N@@ yh@@ e@@ ter , how there are mic@@ ro@@ fil@@ ms in the National arch@@ iv@@ es in Mar@@ yl@@ and , U@@ .@@ S@@ . , that contain documents concerning a total of 2@@ 18@@ ,@@ 000 women , who all wanted to mar@@ ry an S@@ S man .
most of the women are German , but there are also American , French , Dutch , and Russian women .
in addition , there were at least 65 Danish , 86 Nor@@ we@@ gian , 14 Finn@@ ish , and 31 Swedish women who wanted to be Na@@ z@@ i br@@ ides .
the documents and register cards that come from the R@@ ace Office that oper@@ ated in Na@@ z@@ i Germany .
the R@@ ace office oper@@ ated under S@@ S leader He@@ in@@ rich H@@ im@@ m@@ ler .
none of S@@ S men in Na@@ z@@ i Germany were allowed to have children before they were examined by an S@@ S doc@@ tor .
the same was even more true to women , who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children .
according to Ander@@ sson , women were given g@@ y@@ na@@ ecological examin@@ ations to confirm this .
the R@@ ace Office chec@@ ked the women &apos;s back@@ grounds by chec@@ king for example the ch@@ urch regis@@ ters .
the goal was to ensure that there were no Je@@ ws in the women &apos;s family tre@@ e .
the women also had to be ready to give up their Swedish citizenship , and to give the R@@ ace Office their hand@@ written bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ ies , and good references from their next of kin .
the R@@ ace Office wanted guarantees of the women being &quot; f@@ ond of children , &quot; &quot; fru@@ g@@ al , &quot; and &quot; good National Socialists , &quot; who could speak German well .
the women who did not fulfil these requirements were not accepted as br@@ ides for the S@@ S men .
the story does not tell , what happened to the 14 Finn@@ ish women found from the arch@@ ive &apos;s documents .
the S@@ S leaders created a sta@@ te@@ -@@ supported programme known as L@@ eb@@ ens@@ born in 19@@ 36 .
the programme for example determined that each S@@ S men should have four children , either in or out of w@@ ed@@ lock .
L@@ eb@@ ens@@ born homes took care of the children born out of w@@ ed@@ lock and their mo@@ thers .
the programme was not very actively promoted , though , it says on the web@@ site of the United States Hol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust M@@ em@@ or@@ ial M@@ use@@ um .
instead , the Na@@ z@@ i population policies were focused on family and mar@@ ri@@ age .
the state encouraged mar@@ r@@ ying by offering loans and supported having children .
the C@@ ross of H@@ on@@ or of the German M@@ other was given to women , who had borne at least four children .
mar@@ ri@@ ages between &quot; Ar@@ y@@ ans &quot; and &quot; n@@ on@@ -@@ Ar@@ y@@ ans &quot; were for@@ b@@ id@@ den by law in Na@@ z@@ i Germany , it is stated on the m@@ use@@ um web@@ site .

J@@ ar@@ i S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä has been one of the Finn@@ s &quot; fav@@ our@@ ite artis@@ ts already for over 20 years .
from a bar@@ man on a cru@@ ise ship to tan@@ go K@@ ing in 1995 , to the bes@@ t@@ -@@ sell@@ ing sol@@ o artis@@ t in Finland and to a sta@@ r of d@@ ance pa@@ vil@@ ions and f@@ esti@@ val - S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä just ke@@ ep@@ s ro@@ lling along , and has a great mom@@ entu@@ m at the moment .
the book , J@@ ar@@ i S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä - Pal@@ ja@@ ana , written by Mar@@ i K@@ opp@@ inen , tell@@ s about the life of the fav@@ our@@ ite sing@@ er and was published today , on Thursday .
in the book S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä nar@@ rates his life and career , be it positive or negative .

in the competition S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä san@@ g tan@@ go@@ s , but already then he had planned somewhat different musi@@ c for himself .
in the spring of 1995 , Ju@@ k@@ ka Ku@@ op@@ pa@@ m@@ ä@@ ki had com@@ posed a tan@@ go for S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä at his request , and K@@ ass@@ u H@@ al@@ on@@ en then ar@@ ran@@ ged it to a slightly different form .
and the s@@ ong &apos; Sa@@ tu@@ l@@ inna &quot; did become one of the most popular s@@ ong@@ s in Finn@@ ish musi@@ c history .
the book tell@@ s that the record@@ ing of the s@@ ong did not quite go according to plans : S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä had a terrible han@@ go@@ ver when he san@@ g the s@@ ong on ta@@ pe , and he had only s@@ le@@ p@@ t for a couple of hours .
we &apos;@@ d had a party the previous night .
I was so hun@@ g@@ -@@ over !
S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä rec@@ all@@ s in the book .
based on the record@@ ing of the s@@ ong that became an enormous hit , one W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t gu@@ ess that it was san@@ g while han@@ go@@ ver .
even though I was@@ n &apos;@@ t physi@@ cally at my best , the result was still good .
I learned that you don &apos;@@ t have to require per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion and top result from yourself all the time .
another incident , nar@@ rated in the book and relating to his most popular s@@ ong@@ s , happened almost two decades later .
in 20@@ 13 , S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä separ@@ ated from his then partner , and the incident also ended up in the texts of &apos; S@@ in@@ ä an@@ sa@@ it@@ s@@ et k@@ u@@ l@@ ta@@ a &quot; s@@ ong that was published as a single in 20@@ 14 .
the book relates that the l@@ yr@@ ics that were com@@ mission@@ ed from S@@ a@@ ar@@ a T@@ ör@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ en w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t what S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä would &apos;@@ ve wanted .
S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä had imag@@ ined he was doing a record that tell@@ s a true story of his own life , but the l@@ yr@@ ics of the s@@ ong about break@@ -@@ up w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t true , but written based on a piece of news from 7 p@@ ä@@ i@@ v@@ ä@@ ä ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
in the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine article the reason given for the break@@ -@@ up between J@@ ar@@ i and his ex@@ -@@ lo@@ ve was J@@ ar@@ i &apos;s excessive par@@ ty@@ ing and drinking , but this is pur@@ e n@@ on@@ sense according to J@@ ar@@ i and simply not true .
according to book , J@@ ar@@ i was fu@@ ri@@ ous when he called to the record company and refused to sing the s@@ ong , but finally decided on sing@@ ing it - and that &apos;s good .
in June the Br@@ its managed to surprise even themselves by voting their k@@ ing@@ dom out of the EU .
in the end , 52 per cent of the voters supported the ex@@ it and 48 per cent would have sta@@ yed in the union , even though the opinion p@@ oll@@ s from the vote week antici@@ pated an opposite result .
the econom@@ ists and economic institutions of Britain were nearly unanimous in supporting sta@@ ying in the EU .
not one of the respected research institu@@ tes or universities carried the ex@@ it flag , even though a couple of individual researchers d@@ ared to differ from the mainstre@@ am of their prof@@ ession .
the basic man@@ tra of the Western politics , the cat@@ ch@@ phrase from the election campaign of the ex@@ -@@ US President B@@ ill C@@ lin@@ ton , &quot; I@@ t &apos;s the economy , stu@@ pid , &quot; was scrap@@ ped in Britain &apos;s Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
the econom@@ ists were sho@@ cked , when their vo@@ ices were not heard .
they were sho@@ cked , when it seemed that economy was not the most important thing in politics .
economic cur@@ ly speech
in its latest mon@@ thly question@@ na@@ ire , the Centre for ma@@ cro@@ econom@@ ics demands answers for Bre@@ x@@ it disaster from the professional society .
the most typical answer is that the econom@@ ists were not listened to , because this time the voters based their decision on something other than economic grounds .
one econom@@ ist explanation for the loss of economy &apos;s position is that people do not understand the economy .
many still have an image that the number of jobs does not depend on the number of working people , so that it is almost constant .
if an immi@@ grant gets a job , it is taken from a real Bri@@ t .
many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fel@@ l , since it promo@@ tes the ex@@ porting industries .
according to the econom@@ ist base , the voters did not believe the economic arguments , since the unanimity of the econom@@ ists did not come up enough .
they were especially anno@@ yed by the B@@ B@@ C im@@ parti@@ ality that gave the same space both to those econom@@ ists supporting the EU ex@@ it that only present a couple of per cent of the econom@@ ist base , and the overwhelming majority .
the press , hos@@ tile to EU , were not interested in men@@ tioning what i@@ f@@ s , I@@ F@@ M , Bo@@ E , C@@ EP@@ R , L@@ SE , and other powerful economic letter comb@@ in@@ ations thought of the ex@@ it consequences .
those dis@@ tant letter comb@@ in@@ ations spoke fac@@ el@@ ess@@ ly about economic growth , trade relations , national debt , and currency .
and if the econom@@ ists &quot; messages were both listened to and understood , then they were dis@@ regarded , because the econom@@ ists present such el@@ ite with which the voters do not think to have anything in common .
the big city academ@@ ics such as econom@@ ists would have sta@@ yed in the EU , but in small to@@ wns and in country@@ side the message was ineffec@@ tive .
immigration is also economy
the overwhelming w@@ inning argument in the Bre@@ x@@ it vote concerned immigration .
an immi@@ grant will take your job , an immi@@ grant will ja@@ m your hos@@ pi@@ tals , an immi@@ grant will abuse you .
these were the arguments that worked .
every CA@@ F@@ E has foreign employees .
how many more jobs would the Br@@ its have , if they were to leave ?
there are immigrants in every waiting room of every health centre .
how much easier would it be for a Bri@@ t to have a doc@@ tor &apos;s appointment , if they w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t here ?
every school has immigrants &quot; children , too .
how much easier would it be for the children of a true Bri@@ t to have a school place , if we could get rid of them ?
there are fore@@ ig@@ ners living in every mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity .
how much more space would the na@@ tives have , if they would van@@ ish ?
I feel these are economic questions .
they concern jobs , accommod@@ ation , and public services .
the econom@@ ists did not manage to answer them , however , and even if they did , their answers did not get any visi@@ bility .
the econom@@ ists did not succeed in expla@@ ining that thanks to immigrants , the Br@@ its have more jobs , less health centre qu@@ e@@ ues , and more money in education and social security than before .
immigrants , and above all EU immigrants , are net contribu@@ tors to the British public economy , and their spending creates jobs .
A@@ ber@@ d@@ een real es@@ ta@@ te fund prepared for Bre@@ x@@ it with cas@@ h
one of the funds was A@@ ber@@ d@@ een ass@@ et Man@@ agement , whose real es@@ ta@@ te investments are managed by a Fin@@ n Per@@ t@@ ti V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
according to him , A@@ ber@@ d@@ een prepared for Bre@@ x@@ it in time by working out A and B plans .
the preparation for Plan B , the victory of those supporting leaving EU , began more closely a couple of weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave .
the concern was that the investors would begin to withdraw their funds away from the market .
usually a real es@@ ta@@ te fund does not have large li@@ qu@@ id assets , but now they could be necessary .
we began to increase cas@@ h assets .
when Bre@@ x@@ it happened on the 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d , we had 25 per cent of the fund investments either in cas@@ h or as li@@ qu@@ id assets , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en about A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s only daily quo@@ ted real es@@ ta@@ te fund the news concerned .
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , the normal level would be 15@@ -@@ 20 per cent .
the fund value then was £ 3@@ .5 b@@ n .
usually the company &apos;s funds &quot; value is about £ 20 b@@ n .
this is the highest amount in nine op@@ en@@ -@@ end real es@@ ta@@ te funds , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says about all op@@ en@@ -@@ end real es@@ ta@@ te funds in Britain .
he estimates that the lowest cas@@ h amount in these funds remained at 10 per cent or even lower .
so the real es@@ ta@@ te funds had very different strategies in preparing for Bre@@ x@@ it .
funds closing the trade
when the cam@@ p supporting EU ex@@ it won , Europe went ma@@ d .
about two weeks following the vote were , however , very qui@@ et on the real es@@ ta@@ te market , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
then two things happened that changed the situation .
the first was a speech by Mar@@ k Car@@ ney , the Govern@@ or of the Bank of England , in which he estimated that Bre@@ x@@ it can be a big risk for commercial real es@@ ta@@ te actors .
in addition , the first of the real es@@ ta@@ te funds , S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard Li@@ fe , fro@@ ze its trade .
these together turned the situation up@@ side down , and highlighted the issue in the head@@ lines of the Financial T@@ imes and the B@@ B@@ C .
the situation was immediately compared to years 2007 and 2008 , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
this made the investors ner@@ v@@ ous .
the institutional investors sta@@ yed cal@@ mer , but the private investors were ner@@ v@@ ous .
the s@@ no@@ w@@ ball began to ro@@ l@@ l , and a fund after another had to close its doors .
the A@@ ber@@ d@@ een situation was good because of the collec@@ ted cas@@ h assets , but in the end it , too , had to fre@@ ez@@ e its trade for six days .
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , they did not exactly close the trade , but changed the pr@@ icing down@@ wards .
in practice , the investors were given , according to him , time to consider whether they should withdraw the money in pan@@ ic .
the message of A@@ ber@@ d@@ een was that if you do not have to withdraw your money now , it is not profitable , because it would result in losses .
that cal@@ med the situation , and the most cancell@@ ed their notice .
after that , things have been quite even , and for a couple of weeks now , the market has been very cal@@ m , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
he notes that for example A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s Con@@ tin@@ ental Europe funds have had no such ag@@ itation .
there were a lot of inqu@@ iri@@ es , though .
excessive attention to real es@@ ta@@ te funds
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , the sto@@ ps of real es@@ ta@@ te funds &quot; trading got excessive attention .
the op@@ en@@ -@@ end funds the closing affected control about four per cent of the British es@@ ta@@ tes .
the A@@ ber@@ d@@ een stop las@@ ted six days , and the company sold less than 10 of its 80 es@@ ta@@ tes located in London .
some other funds are still closed .
this week , A@@ vi@@ va In@@ ves@@ tors war@@ ned its investors that it may keep its funds closed until 20@@ 17 .
at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty around , and the economy growth predic@@ tions have been adjus@@ ted down@@ wards , but the situation does not look &quot; w@@ il@@ der &quot; relative to A@@ ber@@ d@@ een .
the biggest questions now relate to the future development of British national economy .
despite the uncertainty , the situation has brought even new possibilities to some real es@@ ta@@ te investors , notes V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the p@@ ound and dollar rates are lowest in 30 years , and there is a 15 per cent dis@@ count on the market compared to pre@@ -@@ Bre@@ x@@ it vote time period .
a dollar bu@@ yer can now buy the same es@@ ta@@ te for as much as 30 per cent less .
there are a low of willing bu@@ yers , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
Bre@@ x@@ it brought draw@@ backs to London property market
at two o &apos;@@ c@@ lock in the morning , the situation did not yet look too good .
but at four , when Per@@ t@@ ti V@@ an@@ han@@ en , who is in charge of British real es@@ ta@@ te fund A@@ ber@@ d@@ een ass@@ et Man@@ agement &apos;s property investments , wo@@ ke up to re@@ check the results of the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , the situation had changed .
I had to use a s@@ we@@ ar@@ word .
I realised that we had to soon rely on plan B , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says in his other home in Helsinki .
he head@@ ed for work straight away .
London C@@ ity was already full a@@ wake , despite it still being the small hours .
the T@@ V scre@@ ens in the office , usually mu@@ ted , were now b@@ lar@@ ing the news , and the people , usually loud , were completely sil@@ ent and listening to Prime Minister Davi@@ d Ca@@ mer@@ on as he ste@@ pped in front of the ca@@ mer@@ a in the morning to tell about his res@@ ig@@ nation .
when the market opened , the termin@@ als were all blin@@ king red .
it was a morning you &apos;@@ d never expect to live , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
not just because , despite the tur@@ bul@@ ence , A@@ ber@@ d@@ een , one of the largest real es@@ ta@@ te funds in Britain , fin@@ alised two real es@@ ta@@ te deals on the day after the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , at M@@ id@@ summer .
the atmosphere was conf@@ used .
the company had been preparing well for this alternative , and in that sense , the situation was kind of cal@@ m , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
the Bre@@ x@@ it vote began a correc@@ tion
a stor@@ m followed the vote .
the p@@ ound collap@@ sed , the comm@@ and of Britain was changed .
the market began to anticip@@ ate heavy fall in British real es@@ ta@@ te market , and especially in London .
the decline in London office space was antici@@ pated to be as much as 20 per cent in the following years .
soon a number of British real es@@ ta@@ te funds began to fre@@ ez@@ e their trade , one after another .
also A@@ ber@@ d@@ een did that for six days .
now the stor@@ m has ab@@ ated , but there is still uncertainty in the air .
however , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t show on the face of V@@ an@@ han@@ en , who was spending his final summer va@@ cation days this week in Helsinki .
according to him , it is still too early to say much about the consequences of Bre@@ x@@ it .
so much is still open : how the ex@@ it will happen , and how Scotland will react to the situation , for example .
there have already been some early information about the development of London real es@@ ta@@ te market .
the price development data from a real es@@ ta@@ te service company C@@ B@@ R@@ E cover about a third of the market .
according to this data , all the real es@@ ta@@ te prices in London went down 3@@ ,@@ 3 per cent from June to July .
in London C@@ ity office buildings the price drop was 6@@ ,@@ 1 per cent , lists V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the numbers are not so bad , but they are mon@@ thly changes .
the mon@@ thly inde@@ x publis@@ hing was began in 198@@ 7 , and there have been worse numbers only in five months , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
all the dro@@ ps as big as this co@@ inc@@ id@@ ed with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008 .
this is interesting also because Bre@@ x@@ it was very quickly compared to L@@ eh@@ man fall and the global economy crisis that began from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . real es@@ ta@@ te market .
V@@ an@@ han@@ en thinks that this comparison is not quite ap@@ pos@@ ite , because this is a hom@@ es@@ pu@@ n British crisis .
even the atmosphere is different .
there has been no pan@@ ic sell@@ ing like then , but more a willingness to sell in order to improve li@@ qu@@ id@@ ity , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
even the financing is normal .
we could have faced a correc@@ tion in any case
as a matter of fact , he thinks the price correc@@ tion is not a mi@@ rac@@ le , we could have faced that in any case , even without Bre@@ x@@ it .
according to A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s esti@@ mation , the real es@@ ta@@ te prices in London and other number one cities in the world have been too high already for years .
for two years now , we have said that the C@@ ity and especially the offices are over@@ pr@@ ic@@ ed , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
therefore the drop began from very high .
there are four reasons , why London prices have cl@@ im@@ b@@ ed up , lists V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the British economy has grown strongly , and so has the population in London .
another big trend is that the real es@@ ta@@ te is the last class of ownership to be glob@@ alised , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
there are new market actors from the Middle East and Asia , and more and more institutions and also private investors are looking for real es@@ ta@@ te investments abroad .
as a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known city , London is an easy target .
in addition , the prices have been f@@ ed by the low interest level that has driven for example the pension administration organisations to seek profits from new targets .
and , on top of that , lo@@ an has been easily available , even though V@@ an@@ han@@ en says that the le@@ ver@@ age has been used clearly less than during the bo@@ om before the 2008 crisis .
di@@ versi@@ fy , di@@ versi@@ fy
the price as@@ cent in London was stabil@@ ised last summer , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
even A@@ ber@@ d@@ een began to li@@ gh@@ ten their hol@@ dings in London , and was indeed a net sell@@ er last year .
some kind of a turn was to be expected , and here it is .
what will happen now ?
it depends on how British national economy will develop , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
he does not d@@ are to estimate much , but he says that there will probably be no b@@ oun@@ ce .
the atmosphere indicates that the going will be down@@ ward or level .
V@@ an@@ han@@ en has already seen several up and down movements , because he has been in the real es@@ ta@@ te business since 198@@ 8 .
and he is still an optimis@@ t who believes that work will see us through hol@@ es .
if you are well prepared for risks , you have a better position .
he believes in global di@@ versi@@ fication .
if you have invested too much in one market , you are its victim .
if you have di@@ versi@@ fied , also the risks have been di@@ versi@@ fied , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
s Group to start regis@@ tering sh@@ opp@@ ing information more closely
soon the S Group will know what you e@@ at , because today the business group declared that it will begin to collec@@ t even more precise information about its co@@ -@@ o@@ p members &quot; purch@@ ases .
when so far the information gather@@ ed has been of the total amount of a rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t , in the beginning of May the Group will ho@@ ard it also about the items purch@@ ased .
here the S Group follows after K@@ es@@ ko , since information about items purch@@ ased with a K@@ -@@ P@@ l@@ us@@ sa card has been gather@@ ed to K@@ es@@ ko &apos;s custom@@ er register already for a couple of years .
according to K@@ -@@ P@@ lu@@ s O@@ y Man@@ aging Direc@@ tor Is@@ mo Ri@@ i@@ tal@@ a , the feed@@ back from the programme has been mainly positive .
I@@ tem@@ -@@ specific information is gather@@ ed with the consent of the custom@@ er , and it is used to marketing subject to per@@ mission .
the most effective chan@@ nel is em@@ ai@@ l .
very few customers have for@@ b@@ id@@ den the use of product information , Ri@@ i@@ tal@@ a says to T@@ al@@ ous@@ san@@ om@@ at .
according to him , K@@ es@@ ko will not react to S Group &apos;s regis@@ tering change .
K@@ es@@ ko classi@@ fies its regular customers to ten different groups simply based on gro@@ cer@@ ies alone .
the classification is up@@ dated mon@@ thly .
the regular customers are also classi@@ fied according to the number of purch@@ ased items and the money used .
the information is used to target marketing to the custom@@ er .
I@@ tem@@ -@@ specific information is gather@@ ed only from K@@ -@@ Group &apos;s own cha@@ ins .
partners , like for example N@@ es@@ te O@@ il , do not give away their information .
L@@ id@@ l Finland do not have a custom@@ er loy@@ al@@ ty programme , and currently they are not planning for one , either .
Su@@ om@@ en L@@ ä@@ h@@ ik@@ au@@ p@@ pa has its own Y@@ k@@ k@@ ö@@ s@@ b@@ on@@ us custom@@ er loy@@ al@@ ty programme one can join in a Val@@ in@@ ta@@ tal@@ o , S@@ i@@ w@@ a or Euro@@ market .
currently we do not collec@@ t information on product level or on product group level , we stay at the level of the rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t &apos;s total amount .
so we know where the sh@@ opp@@ ing was done , on what day , and what was the total of the custom@@ er &apos;s rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t .
we have not gone to K@@ -@@ Group &apos;s or S Group &apos;s level , says Bus@@ iness manag@@ er An@@ u Or@@ a .
according to her , there are plans about reforming the custom@@ er loy@@ al@@ ty programme in the future , but L@@ ä@@ h@@ ik@@ au@@ p@@ pa will tell about it later .
however , Or@@ a does not promise that they would start regis@@ tering item information .
an exper@@ iment at first
S@@ ok &apos;s co@@ -@@ o@@ p member and custom@@ er register has already thus far been relatively comprehensive .
the basic information includes personal data and address information , but also prof@@ ession , education , mod@@ e of living , as well as children &apos;s year of birth , and previous personal data .
also the people living in the same hou@@ se@@ hold and their ro@@ les have been registered .
information about the purch@@ ase date , time , and place , the total amount of sh@@ opp@@ ing and the method of payment has been sa@@ ved from an S@@ -@@ C@@ ard purch@@ ase .
in addition , the S@@ -@@ Bon@@ us partners &quot; information has been received from their cas@@ h systems .
from the beginning of May , produc@@ t@@ -@@ level purch@@ ase information will be sa@@ ved in S@@ o@@ ko@@ s and emo@@ tion cha@@ ins .
instead for the present , S@@ -@@ market , P@@ ris@@ ma , K@@ od@@ in Ter@@ ra , and A@@ B@@ C cha@@ ins still register the information on a product group level .
the customers have already for quite some time now expressed wishes of a better targeted marketing , says manag@@ er of S@@ ok &apos;s co@@ -@@ o@@ p member and partner operations Mar@@ ja@@ ana S@@ a@@ ar@@ ik@@ os@@ ki .
s Group says it will inform its customers about the change .
they can for@@ b@@ id the use of produc@@ t@@ -@@ level information to marketing .
the information is sto@@ red at the cas@@ h regis@@ ters anyway , whether you want it or not .
those who want can check their sa@@ ved information on the S Group web@@ site .
for example cas@@ hi@@ ers cannot access the information , S@@ a@@ ar@@ ik@@ os@@ ki points out .
v@@ ide@@ o : pu@@ pp@@ y He@@ il@@ a is the new@@ est do@@ g reinfor@@ cement of the Finn@@ ish Cus@@ tom@@ s - the pu@@ pp@@ y will be the first explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ g
a black L@@ ab@@ rad@@ or re@@ tri@@ ever pu@@ pp@@ y is ener@@ ge@@ tically s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing five similar bo@@ xes , ar@@ ran@@ ged in a row on the ground at Helsinki airport .
in no time at all , it decid@@ edly sit next to the bo@@ x in the centre .
customs inspec@@ tor L@@ ass@@ i S@@ un@@ ti@@ o re@@ wards his do@@ g He@@ il@@ a by using its fav@@ our@@ ite to@@ y to play with the do@@ g .
from the bo@@ x He@@ il@@ a s@@ at next to , a can of car@@ tr@@ id@@ ge cases that sm@@ ell like g@@ un@@ pow@@ der gas was revealed .
g@@ un@@ pow@@ der gas is the first sc@@ ent we have been now prac@@ tising with He@@ il@@ a , says S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , the ow@@ ner of the pu@@ pp@@ y .
security situation and e@@ -@@ commerce the main reasons
He@@ il@@ a is the Cus@@ tom@@ s &quot; first do@@ g speci@@ alised in sear@@ ching for arms and explo@@ si@@ ves , and it will be placed to Helsinki airport next year .
if need be , work duties might take He@@ il@@ a and S@@ un@@ ti@@ o also to other points of entry and to har@@ bour .
the airport will , however , be He@@ il@@ a &apos;s main work place , since the international security situation has changed on account of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe .
the attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the customs to take measures , and after the attacks , control has been strengthened , says Su@@ per@@ vision Direc@@ tor M@@ ik@@ ko Grö@@ n@@ berg from the Cus@@ tom@@ s .
another main reason for training an arms and explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ g for the Cus@@ tom@@ s , are the postal items that are carried via Helsinki airport .
with the grown on@@ line sales , there are up to about 40 million postal items carried via Helsinki airport every year , and these may include arms equipment and explo@@ sive materials ord@@ ered from abroad .
in recent years , the Cus@@ tom@@ s has discovered about 300 findings related to g@@ un@@ s , gun parts , am@@ mun@@ ition and explo@@ sive materials and their basic materials from the Helsinki airport .
He@@ il@@ a will work across Helsinki airport .
it will examine registered lu@@ gg@@ age and postal items .
it will be a great advantage at har@@ bour@@ s in the future , as it can search large c@@ rate areas and mark those areas that require a more thorough investigation , says Grö@@ n@@ berg .
based on how He@@ il@@ a will perform , the Cus@@ tom@@ s decid@@ es whether they will train more arms and explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ gs in the future .
Grö@@ n@@ berg is hope@@ ful about that .
a school at Kir@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ um@@ mi
pu@@ pp@@ y He@@ il@@ a &apos;s training is coordinated by the Cus@@ tom@@ s Do@@ g Tra@@ ining Centre , located at Kir@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ um@@ mi .
S@@ un@@ ti@@ o and He@@ il@@ a will also be trained by the Pol@@ ice and Finn@@ ish Defence For@@ ces experts .
the Pol@@ ice have strong experience on do@@ g training , and the Defence For@@ ces on explo@@ si@@ ves .
the Cus@@ tom@@ s decide together with other authorities what sc@@ ents He@@ il@@ a is tau@@ ght to recognise .
He@@ il@@ a will be further trained as is necessary , says Grö@@ n@@ berg .
He@@ il@@ a &apos;s colleagues at Helsinki A@@ ir@@ port are the Cus@@ tom@@ s &quot; six drug do@@ gs and the money and drug do@@ g M@@ ass@@ i .
L@@ ab@@ rad@@ or re@@ tri@@ ever He@@ il@@ a has been chosen from a l@@ itte@@ r of ten pu@@ pp@@ ies .
when cho@@ os@@ ing a do@@ g for airport , the selec@@ tion criteria include acti@@ veness , hun@@ ting ins@@ t@@ inc@@ t , and cal@@ m@@ ness , because the do@@ g will deal with g@@ un@@ s , explo@@ si@@ ves , and stre@@ ams of people .
He@@ il@@ a , who lives with S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , is a close fellow wor@@ ker of the customs inspec@@ tor , but also a family member .
you can &apos;@@ t go anywhere at home without He@@ il@@ a , lau@@ gh@@ s S@@ un@@ ti@@ o .
sub@@ t@@ le orders cl@@ ick with He@@ il@@ a at the first go .
the ca@@ mer@@ a@@ man from I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at los@@ es his ca@@ mer@@ a M@@ I@@ C cover to the fast do@@ g , but He@@ il@@ a gives the cover that looks like a so@@ ft to@@ y back immediately after hearing the comm@@ and &quot; let go . &quot;
hard competition for u@@ til@@ ity do@@ gs
H@@ ella &apos;s early training will be ready next year .
there still are pla@@ cement tests ahead , the next one in October , when it will be assessed whether the training is adequate for the ex@@ ac@@ ting work tasks .
if everything goes according to plans , He@@ il@@ a can be seen working at Helsinki A@@ ir@@ port next year .
unfortunately the passengers cannot p@@ et the do@@ g we@@ aring a work west , remin@@ ds S@@ un@@ ti@@ o .
one u@@ til@@ ity do@@ g &apos;s expenses for the Cus@@ tom@@ s are about 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000@@ -@@ 7@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euros per year .
their work age is about seven to eight years , possibly even ten , after which they reti@@ re to their ow@@ ner &apos;s care .
the work days can be long , from eight to ten hours , but the active work sections only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours .
there is hard competition at the Cus@@ tom@@ s for the ownership of u@@ til@@ ity do@@ gs .
about 20@@ -@@ 30 Cus@@ tom@@ s workers applied to be H@@ ella &apos;s ow@@ ner .
the lu@@ ck@@ y one was S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , who has not had a work do@@ g before , but he has a long experience with do@@ gs and Cus@@ tom@@ s &quot; supervision tasks .

Ro@@ P@@ S acquired Es@@ ton@@ ian forward Pro@@ sa - V@@ e@@ ik@@ ka@@ us@@ li@@ ig@@ a - I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at
Ro@@ van@@ i@@ em@@ en P@@ all@@ os@@ e@@ ur@@ a , who play in men &apos;s premi@@ er football division in Finland , has made contract until the end of the se@@ as@@ on with the Es@@ ton@@ ian forward Al@@ bert Pro@@ sa .
we were looking for a strik@@ er with good capac@@ ities , who would sett@@ le in easily to Finland and to Ro@@ van@@ i@@ em@@ i .
together with 10 pla@@ yer agents we went through over 50 players from all over the world .
little by little , Pro@@ sa began to stand out as a good option , said Ro@@ P@@ S co@@ ach J@@ uh@@ a Mal@@ inen in a press release .
Pro@@ sa , 25 , come to Ro@@ P@@ S from a T@@ all@@ in@@ n team Flor@@ a , where he sco@@ red a total of 51 goals in 10@@ 9 mat@@ ches .
he has also played for the Es@@ ton@@ ian national team .
Pro@@ sa is supposed to play with Ro@@ P@@ S already on Sa@@ tur@@ day in Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki , where the Ro@@ van@@ i@@ em@@ i group meets the re@@ ig@@ ning Finn@@ ish cha@@ mp@@ ion S@@ J@@ K .

V@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous M@@ od@@ er@@ n F@@ am@@ ily sta@@ r causes a sti@@ r again : the te@@ en@@ age sta@@ r &apos;s shor@@ ts reve@@ al almost everything
Ari@@ el W@@ inter , who became known as the good@@ -@@ na@@ tured A@@ le@@ x D@@ un@@ phy of the com@@ ed@@ y series M@@ od@@ er@@ n F@@ am@@ ily , causes a sti@@ r again by dis@@ playing her volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous cur@@ ves .
win@@ ter was p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed in H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood this week we@@ aring ho@@ t pan@@ ts that don &apos;@@ t leave much to the imag@@ ination .
the shor@@ ts revealed not only the ac@@ t@@ ress &quot; leg@@ s , but also her behind .
18@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ old W@@ inter has la@@ tely attrac@@ ted attention by changing her sty@@ le and behaviour to considerably more d@@ aring .
the sta@@ r has published pic@@ tures of her posing while we@@ aring very little in the social media , and she has taken several ta@@ t@@ to@@ os .
the young woman has also been seen we@@ aring extremely s@@ k@@ im@@ p@@ y out@@ f@@ its .
win@@ ter , who is on the threshold of ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood , has la@@ tely also published several pic@@ tures of her@@ self par@@ ty@@ ing .
if the image is@@ n &apos;@@ t visible , you can see it here .
earlier this summer F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws asked some experts , why W@@ inter has changed her public image in such a radical way .
back then , the foun@@ der and C@@ E@@ O of P@@ ow@@ er@@ w@@ om@@ en@@ T@@ V , A@@ my Pal@@ mer , sus@@ pected that W@@ inter is experiencing a &quot; typical H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood trans@@ formation &quot; from a child sta@@ r to an ad@@ ult .
she has been on television for nearly her whole life , and she has grown up in the Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an era .
she has lear@@ n@@ t that the more you show b@@ are s@@ kin , the more public@@ ity and attention you get in H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood , Pal@@ mer said to F@@ o@@ x news adding that this exactly same phenomenon has already been seen coun@@ tless time before .
win@@ ter began in M@@ od@@ er@@ n F@@ am@@ ily when she was only 11 years old .
the ac@@ tor has anno@@ yed some of her long@@ -@@ time f@@ ans with this change in her image .
it is not difficult to gu@@ ess , where she will be in ten years , since the down@@ hill is already this ste@@ ep , one women stated on W@@ inter &apos;s In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m account .
some of her f@@ ans instead defend the ac@@ t@@ ress , saying that she shoul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t care about the cr@@ iti@@ que .
you look ama@@ z@@ ing !
it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t matter what other people say .
you are an inspi@@ ration to many women , a young woman pra@@ ises .
the Japan@@ ese prefer Finland from the Nordic countries - touris@@ ts are temp@@ ted with a@@ uro@@ ra@@ s : in the autumn it is possible to see a fan@@ tas@@ tic mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r a@@ uro@@ ra
the purpose of the campaign is to temp@@ t the Japan@@ ese to begin their a@@ uro@@ ra tri@@ ps already early in the autumn , V@@ is@@ it Finland says in a press release .
the main attrac@@ tions for the Japan@@ ese a@@ uro@@ ra travel are In@@ ar@@ i and L@@ ev@@ i .
the a@@ uro@@ ra bo@@ re@@ al@@ is are the main assets for our win@@ ter travel , and they are strongly connected with mid@@ win@@ ter and s@@ no@@ w@@ y land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es .
there is a good demand for w@@ inter@@ y a@@ uro@@ ra tri@@ ps to L@@ ap@@ land , but now we attempt to increase the sales of autumn tri@@ ps .
not many know that the a@@ uro@@ ra se@@ as@@ on beg@@ ins already early in the autumn and continues until late in the spring .
during autumn it is possible to see the so@@ -@@ called mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r a@@ uro@@ ra , where the sur@@ face of a la@@ ke reflects the a@@ uro@@ ra , thus making the vision twice as fan@@ tas@@ tic , acting Mar@@ ket@@ ing manag@@ er A@@ nne Lin@@ d descri@@ bes in the press release .
the main target group for V@@ is@@ it Finland &apos;s a@@ uro@@ ra campaign are the we@@ al@@ thy , c@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ living Japan@@ ese women between 25 and 35 years , who dream about travelling and new experiences .
they are already interested in Finland , its nature and design .
touris@@ ts are attrac@@ ted to Finland using for example on@@ line advertising .
researchers from A@@ al@@ to Uni@@ versity and from universities of Tur@@ k@@ u and To@@ ky@@ o carried out a surve@@ y , according to which Finland &apos;s country image is excep@@ tionally strong and positive among the Japan@@ ese when compared to other Nordic countries .
however , the Japan@@ ese do wish for clearer unique attrac@@ tions from Finland , and this is where a@@ uro@@ ra have enormous potential , according to Lin@@ d .
the over@@ night sta@@ ys of Japan@@ ese touris@@ ts have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries .
last year they over@@ ni@@ ghted in Finland over twice more than in Sweden , Denmark or Nor@@ way .
from the point of view of Finn@@ ish travel , the Japan@@ ese as a target group are interesting , because they spend over 80 million euros in Finland .
on average , the Japan@@ ese spent 18@@ 3 euros a day in Finland , says Lin@@ d .
Britain sett@@ le for sil@@ ver in ru@@ g@@ by sev@@ ens after F@@ ij@@ i mas@@ ter@@ class sees them take g@@ old
great Britain &apos;s im@@ pressive run in the Ru@@ g@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a cr@@ as@@ hing halt at the final hur@@ dle by F@@ ij@@ i in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehen@@ sively be@@ a@@ ten 4@@ 3@@ -@@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ or@@ o Sta@@ di@@ um here in Rio .
F@@ ij@@ i gave a mas@@ ter@@ class in handling , off@@ -@@ loading , si@@ de@@ -@@ ste@@ pping , support play , running lines and bru@@ te strength to win g@@ old - their first Olymp@@ ic med@@ al of any col@@ our .
de@@ fe@@ at came with the n@@ on@@ -@@ too sha@@ b@@ by con@@ sol@@ ation of sil@@ ver - Britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral Olymp@@ ic 7@@ s t@@ our@@ na@@ ment in which they be@@ at New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Argent@@ ina and South Africa along the way .
the bru@@ ising be@@ ating of the Bo@@ ks , 7@@ -@@ 5 in the sem@@ i@@ -@@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to b@@ ite them in the final .
but , regardless , F@@ ij@@ i on this form would have be@@ a@@ ten a fit as a f@@ id@@ dle 15@@ -@@ man team .
it may be some con@@ sol@@ ation to G@@ B - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a g@@ old med@@ al around his nec@@ k tomorrow : F@@ ij@@ i &apos;s head co@@ ach is B@@ en R@@ y@@ an , the former England b@@ os@@ s from W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ on .
it has been some jour@@ ney for G@@ B .
eight years ago , under R@@ y@@ an , they lost every game at the A@@ dela@@ ide sev@@ ens .
here , they lost just one .
this ham@@ mer@@ ing will hur@@ t but the progress is star@@ t@@ ling .
F@@ ij@@ i started mag@@ nific@@ ently , b@@ oun@@ cing off G@@ B tac@@ kl@@ es for fu@@ n .
it was like running into a series of moving bus@@ es for cap@@ tain T@@ om Mit@@ ch@@ ell and co and the World Ser@@ ies cha@@ mp@@ ions went 5@@ -@@ 0 up when O@@ sea K@@ ol@@ inis@@ au di@@ ved over in the cor@@ ner .
with four minutes on the c@@ lock j@@ er@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another down the right wing , which was conver@@ ted .
12@@ -@@ 0 and G@@ B had hardly touched the ball .
a super@@ b Mit@@ ch@@ ell tackle stopped the man@@ -@@ mountain Le@@ one N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a from sc@@ or@@ ing a third but it was only dela@@ ying F@@ ij@@ i .
on seven minutes J@@ as@@ a Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a touched down in the right cor@@ ner and G@@ B were 17@@ -@@ 0 to the bad .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a added another from the res@@ tar@@ t and there was still over a minute on the c@@ lock ... in the first half .
V@@ a@@ tem@@ o R@@ av@@ ou@@ vo@@ u then bur@@ st through some more lim@@ p G@@ B tackling and stor@@ med to the line to sc@@ ore .
the conver@@ sion made it 2@@ 9@@ -@@ 0 at the break .
it was as if F@@ ij@@ i had been born to play 7@@ s , while G@@ B are still learning the trade .
which is pre@@ tty much how it is .
G@@ B made wh@@ oles@@ ale changes at hal@@ f@@ -@@ time and they plu@@ g@@ ged the F@@ ij@@ ian d@@ am ... for all of four minutes , which by fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ half standards was good , until Jos@@ ua Tu@@ is@@ o@@ va went over after some bri@@ lli@@ ant F@@ ij@@ ian inter@@ play .
D@@ an Nor@@ ton gra@@ b@@ bed a try for G@@ B , tou@@ ching down in the left cor@@ ner to make it 3@@ 6@@ -@@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Is@@ lan@@ ders whose f@@ ans san@@ g , wa@@ ved flags and d@@ an@@ ced in the stands .
it was hard not to admi@@ re F@@ ij@@ i &apos;s whole jo@@ y@@ ful approach .
M@@ a@@ ta V@@ ili@@ a@@ me ic@@ ed the F@@ ij@@ ian ca@@ ke that d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t need icing with another try in the d@@ ying mom@@ ents .
the wh@@ ist@@ le went , the F@@ ij@@ ians emb@@ rac@@ ed and G@@ B hit the tur@@ f , thoroughly be@@ a@@ ten .
earlier in the day , F@@ ij@@ i had be@@ a@@ ten Japan 20@@ -@@ 5 in their sem@@ i@@ -@@ final and G@@ B ed@@ ged South Africa in a ti@@ ght sem@@ i@@ -@@ final of one try each - Britain &apos;s conver@@ sion the difference .
Ky@@ le Bro@@ wn put the Bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but D@@ an Nor@@ ton with some da@@ zz@@ ling foot@@ work bro@@ ke the line and sco@@ red under the posts in the second half .
a bri@@ lli@@ ant late tackle from Mar@@ c@@ us Watson , bro@@ ther of England &apos;s 15@@ -@@ aside team , An@@ th@@ ony , secu@@ red the win - and ultimately the sil@@ ver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning inspi@@ red to ro@@ wing victory by co@@ ach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emo@@ tive g@@ old at these g@@ ames , and that is saying something .
from the first s@@ tro@@ ke to the last , 2@@ 20 pun@@ ishing hea@@ ves into history , Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning found added meaning in their g@@ ol@@ den moment at the E@@ sta@@ ci@@ o da L@@ ag@@ o@@ a .
though they were the two pu@@ lling on the o@@ ars , there were three vo@@ ices in that bo@@ at , the ech@@ o of co@@ ach Rob@@ in W@@ illi@@ ams ever present as they pow@@ ered to a second succ@@ es@@ sive Olymp@@ ic g@@ old in the women &apos;s pa@@ irs , the first f@@ em@@ al@@ es in the ann@@ als of British sport to scale such a he@@ ight .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all this was their 3@@ 9@@ th ou@@ ting un@@ be@@ a@@ ten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two bri@@ lli@@ ant a@@ th@@ le@@ tes s@@ ka@@ ting over the sur@@ face with the el@@ e@@ gan@@ ce of sw@@ ans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the tri@@ ump@@ h .
behind every ro@@ wing g@@ old is a b@@ atta@@ li@@ on of willing hands contributing the inc@@ re@@ mental gain@@ s that make the difference , and no hands were more instru@@ mental than those of a co@@ ach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diag@@ nos@@ ed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
I had bla@@ d@@ der cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;@@ t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pre@@ tty bad situation .
it al@@ ters your out@@ look a bit .
W@@ illi@@ ams was diag@@ nos@@ ed in December 20@@ 13 .
the tri@@ o were for@@ tunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 20@@ 14 out of se@@ as@@ on , keeping the dis@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
I was in h@@ osp@@ ital and I was w@@ al@@ king around the ward - 20@@ ft , 30@@ ft 5@@ 0@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it star@@ ts off .
ro@@ wing in itself is a jour@@ ney but that makes it a bit big@@ ger .
in the im@@ medi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts were for W@@ illi@@ ams , who had spent a ner@@ v@@ y morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own an@@ xi@@ eties .
S@@ tan@@ ning , a cap@@ tain in the Ro@@ y@@ al ar@@ ti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment with a t@@ our of Afghanistan behind her , said &quot; I &apos;@@ ve been an emo@@ tional wrec@@ k this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reite@@ rates how much this means to me , how much me and Hel@@ en have worked and Rob@@ in as well .
it &apos;s been a fan@@ tas@@ tic three years back with Hel@@ en and Rob@@ in .
without Rob@@ in we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best co@@ ach in the world .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better co@@ ach .
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a pun@@ ishing r@@ hy@@ th@@ m that their ri@@ val@@ s could never match .
even in the final 500 met@@ res when the cre@@ ws from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and Denmark began to close , S@@ tan@@ ning and G@@ lo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
Hel@@ en was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t looking to do anything ama@@ z@@ ing .
we w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t looking for fi@@ re@@ works today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their fu@@ tures .
G@@ lo@@ ver has a w@@ ed@@ ding to attend next month , her own to television ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rer Ste@@ ve B@@ ac@@ ks@@ h@@ all .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olymp@@ ic cha@@ mp@@ ion .
it was all so new and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
I@@ cel@@ and changes its government that was di@@ r@@ ti@@ ed in the P@@ an@@ ama lea@@ ks

his success@@ or , S@@ ig@@ ur@@ du@@ r In@@ g@@ i Joh@@ ans@@ son , promised then to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn .
the election date is now set to be October 2@@ 9@@ th .
according to analys@@ ts , it is difficult to predic@@ t the extent of the effect the people &apos;s ra@@ ge from last spring will have on the autumn &apos;s election result .
in June &apos;s presidential elections the critic@@ al@@ ness towards those in power was clearly seen , and G@@ ud@@ n@@ i Joh@@ ann@@ ess@@ on , who came from outside the politics , was elected president .

the Democratic Party was fu@@ ri@@ ous about this and demanded an apolog@@ y from tr@@ um@@ p .

M@@ T@@ K &apos;s Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen on the forest gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion : over 80 perc@@ ent of the forest owners outside
the forest gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion is one of the tax changes in the next year &apos;s budget proposal by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance .
a tax d@@ educ@@ tion to the income tax law is proposed . the d@@ educ@@ tion would be granted on the basis of forest property succ@@ ession gi@@ ft tax .
in the proposal by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance , this forest gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion has four goals : to promote generation changes in forest hol@@ dings , to make forest owners &quot; age structure youn@@ ger , to increase the holding siz@@ es , and to increase the wood supply .
the goal of the Minis@@ try is to promote entrepren@@ e@@ uri@@ al forestry .
a forest ow@@ ner would make the d@@ educ@@ tion from the pur@@ e income from forest capital .
generally speaking , the idea of doing a tool such as this to promote forest pro@@ per@@ ties &quot; gener@@ ational change is good , commen@@ ted the For@@ es@@ try Direc@@ tor J@@ uh@@ a Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen of the Central Union of Agricul@@ tural Pro@@ duc@@ ers and For@@ est O@@ w@@ ners ( M@@ T@@ K ) .
however , Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen did find points of criticism from the tax change proposal .
the forest gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion is proposed to be made from the pur@@ e capital income of the forest ow@@ ner .
it is capital income from which all the other d@@ educ@@ tions have been d@@ educ@@ ted .
according to M@@ T@@ K and Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen , the effectiveness of the tax d@@ educ@@ tion would be greater , if the d@@ educ@@ tion could be made straight from the wood sales proceed@@ s .
the starting point for the Mo@@ F proposal is that by making the d@@ educ@@ tion from the forestry &apos;s pur@@ e capital income , it is possible to prevent forestry capital income losses based on the d@@ educ@@ tion that then would be d@@ educ@@ ted elsewhere in taxation .
in this case a person would get a tax benefit even without sell@@ ing wood .
the calc@@ ulation model is un@@ necessarily complicated .
an average forest ow@@ ner is not able to piece it together , says Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen .
in addition , he says , the model only affects a small part of forest owners .
the proposed limit of tax d@@ educ@@ tion that is ti@@ ed to the forest &apos;s profits is 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euros .
Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen thinks this is too high .
according to him , as such it will eliminate 82 per cent of Finn@@ ish forest owners away from the reduction sphere .
this model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners , he says .
Mo@@ F sees the limit as supporting the goal of increasing holding siz@@ es .
according to Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen , forest gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion has been talked about for decades .
the reason behind it is the aging of forest owners .
according to M@@ T@@ K , at the moment , the average age of forest owners is over 60 years , and about half of forest owners are pensioners .
a heavy ha@@ il@@ stor@@ m surprised the motor@@ ists at H@@ im@@ an@@ ka - two cars fel@@ l into a d@@ it@@ ch and coll@@ id@@ ed with each other
a pec@@ uli@@ ar re@@ ar@@ -@@ end coll@@ ision happened at K@@ ala@@ jo@@ ki &apos;s H@@ im@@ an@@ ka on Friday morning .
according to the res@@ c@@ ue depart@@ ment , two cars that were driving one after another fel@@ l into a d@@ it@@ ch , after which the car driving behind coll@@ id@@ ed with the re@@ ar end of the car driving in front .
according to the fire mas@@ ter on duty , Har@@ ri P@@ y@@ yh@@ ti@@ ä , the falling is sus@@ pected to be caused by a heavy ha@@ il@@ stor@@ m .
the car that was driving behind had two persons in it , and they both were taken to h@@ osp@@ ital .
there is no specific information about their in@@ j@@ uri@@ es .
the dri@@ ver of the car that dro@@ ve in front was not in@@ ju@@ red .
the accident happened on the main road number 8 , a few kilomet@@ res from H@@ im@@ an@@ ka towards K@@ ala@@ jo@@ ki .
Finn@@ ish study can help in improving the effect of cancer treat@@ ments
the new study results from researchers in Uni@@ versity of Tur@@ k@@ u can help in developing more effective cancer treat@@ ments .
the observations by Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y of Finland res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er Joh@@ ann@@ a I@@ vas@@ ka &apos;s research group show that the hard@@ ness of a cancer tu@@ m@@ our increases the cancer mal@@ ig@@ nan@@ cy .
many human t@@ issues , like breast t@@ issue , are very so@@ ft , and the t@@ issue cells grow as usual in an environment such as this .
according to I@@ vas@@ ka , it was possible to stop the cancer growth in a labor@@ atory environment by returning the t@@ issue surrounding the cancer to cor@@ respond to normal , so@@ ft t@@ issue .
in the future it may be possible to improve medical cancer treat@@ ments &quot; effectiveness by foc@@ us@@ sing on the communication between cells and surrounding t@@ issue in addition to cancer cells in treat@@ ments .
the study results have been published 4 August in a pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous cell@@ ular bi@@ ology publication , Na@@ ture Commun@@ ications .
the hearing of the M@@ u@@ ho@@ s foster home hom@@ ic@@ ide continues at the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al , the prosecu@@ tor demands a hom@@ ic@@ ide sentence also to the other off@@ ender .
the hearing of the M@@ u@@ ho@@ s foster home case continues at the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al for both senten@@ ced persons .
in June , two young men were senten@@ ced to prison for a foster home hom@@ ic@@ ide in M@@ u@@ ho@@ s .
one got 8 years and 4 months for man@@ slaughter and for ag@@ gra@@ vated ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y as a young person , among other things .
the other one &apos;s sentence is 12 years for murder as a young person and for ag@@ gra@@ vated ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
the one senten@@ ced for man@@ slaughter was senten@@ ced also for ag@@ gra@@ vated endang@@ ering of road safety as a young person , and un@@ law@@ ful driving of a vehicle as a young person .
the prosecu@@ tor , compla@@ in@@ ants , and the man with the more severe sentence compla@@ ined about the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court &apos;s sentence .
the prosecu@@ tor demands that the man with the li@@ ghter senten@@ ced should also be senten@@ ced 12 years in prison for murder as a young person .
both were Com@@ po@@ s men@@ ti@@ s at the time of the crime
according to the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court , in last July the two 17@@ -@@ year old young men killed a man who worked as a supervis@@ or at a foster home under a re@@ for@@ ma@@ tory school .
according to the Court &apos;s ration@@ ale for the sentence , the 17@@ -@@ year old who was senten@@ ced for murder atta@@ cked the supervis@@ or from behind , as this was sitting on the living room S@@ O@@ F@@ A .
the supervis@@ or managed to dis@@ en@@ tan@@ g@@ le himself from the hold , leading the young person to his room , when the other of young person hit him with a va@@ c@@ uu@@ m clean@@ er pi@@ pe .
the supervis@@ or was also str@@ ang@@ led with a cor@@ d , hit , and k@@ ic@@ ked to the head .
according to the mental examination , both of the condemned were of sound mind in the time of the crime .
according to the Court , the youth had planned an escap@@ e from the foster home at least since the previous day .
Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k is the long@@ es@@ t@@ -@@ living ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the world , does not re@@ produce until its 15@@ 6 years old
the long@@ es@@ t@@ -@@ living ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the world was confirmed to be the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k , stated a study published by Sci@@ ence .
Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k , also known as gre@@ y shar@@ k , sw@@ im@@ s in the North Atlantic , like around Gre@@ en@@ land , and can live to be up to 400 years old .
the female does not re@@ produce until its 15@@ 6 years old .
Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k &apos;s life sp@@ an is l@@ eng@@ th@@ ened by the fact it gro@@ ws only about 1 c@@ enti@@ met@@ re a year .
only a certain cla@@ m species is known to live longer than the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k .
the researchers revealed the age with radi@@ oc@@ ar@@ bon dating .
some of the shar@@ ks had radioactive tra@@ ces because of the nuclear tests done in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
based on those , the researchers were able to estimate the shar@@ ks &quot; age .
the ol@@ des@@ t was estimated to be 3@@ 92 years , however the vari@@ ation can be as much as plus or min@@ us 120 years .

D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s America do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t need the rest of the world .
as much as a third of all the state &apos;s tax revenue would be lost , if the change to corporate taxes that D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p pus@@ hes is implemented .
the tax reven@@ ues would be reduced also with the tax concessions that benefit especially the rich@@ est ones .
presenting his tax programme on Monday in D@@ et@@ ro@@ it , tr@@ um@@ p described it as re@@ volu@@ tionary .
corporate tax would decreas@@ e from 35 per cent to 15 per cent .
a truly enormous sum would be left un@@ collec@@ ted , 1@@ 000 billion doll@@ ars per year .
the highest income tax percentage is now 3@@ 9@@ ,@@ 6 , and 33 after the reduction tr@@ um@@ p has proposed .
inher@@ i@@ tance tax would be completely wa@@ iv@@ ed .
tr@@ um@@ p bla@@ med the state for regulating the economy too much , and for for@@ cing small companies into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy .
the hur@@ ri@@ edly decided environmental standards must be re@@ make , and energy regulations must be res@@ cin@@ ded .
Bar@@ ac@@ k Ob@@ ama &apos;s health care reform must be re@@ considered .

a &quot; disastrous &quot; trade policy is one of the biggest reasons to United States &quot; problems according to tr@@ um@@ p .
free trade agreements would be cancell@@ ed .

a ti@@ d@@ al wave from the past - K@@ ans@@ an U@@ ut@@ is@@ et
the sea ch@@ ur@@ ns fa@@ te@@ fully , but the true ti@@ d@@ al wave h@@ its among Madrid &apos;s cro@@ w@@ ds - the day of rec@@ k@@ on@@ ing with the past can begin .
that is the core of the story in P@@ ed@@ ro Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r &apos;s new@@ est .
the previous film Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r directed , I &apos;@@ m S@@ o ex@@ ci@@ ted ( 20@@ 13 ) , was a somewhat c@@ amp@@ y and rather racy sa@@ ti@@ r@@ ical com@@ ed@@ y , the one prec@@ eding that , The s@@ kin I live In ( 20@@ 11 ) , one of the cul@@ min@@ ations of the Spanish vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o &apos;s career .
as to its level , Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta ( 20@@ 16 ) is placed some@@ where in between those two works .
it is conven@@ tionally ser@@ ene lo@@ ve , relationship and family dra@@ ma , in the centre of which is a mo@@ ther@@ -@@ d@@ au@@ ghter relationship .
the story is a simple one , and largely told in f@@ las@@ h@@ backs .
life seems to be going well for the mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged title character ( E@@ m@@ ma Su@@ ar@@ e@@ z ) , but then all threa@@ tens to fall apart .
in the wake of a ran@@ dom en@@ counter , a new partner ( D@@ ar@@ io G@@ ran@@ d@@ in@@ et@@ ti ) is as@@ ton@@ ished all the way to the final stages of the film .
in the form of a f@@ las@@ h@@ back and a long letter , Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta rec@@ oun@@ ts her life story to her grow@@ n@@ up d@@ au@@ ghter .
she beg@@ ins from the time before the d@@ au@@ ghter was born , from the mom@@ ents she met the future fa@@ ther of the g@@ ir@@ l ( Dan@@ i@@ el Gra@@ o ) .
at the same time , A@@ dra@@ ina U@@ gar@@ te , who is familiar from the T@@ V series The Time in B@@ et@@ w@@ een ( 20@@ 13@@ -@@ 20@@ 14 ) , ris@@ es to the role of the other leading la@@ dy : Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta as a young teac@@ her .
Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta &apos;s aging has been realised in a way that can be considered as clu@@ m@@ sy , but I myself would say that it is kind of f@@ un@@ n@@ y and li@@ terally done in one fel@@ l sw@@ o@@ o@@ p .
Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta has long distance to the spar@@ kl@@ ing , including hu@@ m@@ our , that so often character@@ ises Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r &apos;s fil@@ ms .
it is even@@ ly acted , com@@ posed , containing good musi@@ c here and there , and rather mel@@ an@@ ch@@ ol@@ ic film that has ingredients for an el@@ e@@ gy the way it is .
instead the vis@@ ual sa@@ tu@@ ration that is typical for the Spanish direc@@ tor is still ex@@ tant , and it exists in a way it slowly beg@@ ins to stick out more as a pur@@ e techn@@ ic@@ ality than a functional dramatic effect .
the char@@ ac@@ ters in the film are tested by ill@@ nesses , deaths , or sud@@ den losses for no particular reason , but the sur@@ face remains dec@@ or@@ ative .
this is true especially when it comes to cos@@ tu@@ mes : in the case of the t@@ itu@@ la@@ r character the cos@@ tu@@ mes change from one sc@@ ene to another , and the same is true for the fla@@ m@@ bo@@ y@@ ant ear@@ r@@ ings .
Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r is particular in these things , but the main thing , the set@@ -@@ up@@ s of each sc@@ ene , do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t really improve by this .
as it is mechan@@ ically repeated , the impression is deta@@ ched and slightly sp@@ ir@@ it@@ less .
Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r has written the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t based on three short stor@@ ies by Al@@ ice M@@ un@@ ro , a Can@@ ad@@ ian who received the No@@ bel pri@@ ze for li@@ tera@@ ture in 20@@ 13 .
the short stor@@ ies have been published in the book run@@ away : stor@@ ies .
Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r has invested in the dialogue , and the result is a slightly mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous li@@ ter@@ ary li@@ tera@@ ture cin@@ em@@ at@@ isation .
the ingredients for by far emo@@ tionally more ro@@ b@@ ust a dra@@ ma were there , so great are the things discussed in the film &apos;s them@@ atic material , especially g@@ na@@ wing gu@@ il@@ t .
directed and man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ t by : P@@ ed@@ ro Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r .

the government attempts a vote tric@@ k - K@@ ans@@ an U@@ ut@@ is@@ et
there will be no new cuts , the ministers keep on saying , so that the Finn@@ s Party would not completely collapse .
though there are pl@@ enty of cuts decided in spring that are made .
there will be no new cuts .
the already decided cuts of 4 billion are enough .
this is what the Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä ( Centre ) and the Minister of Fin@@ ance P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ p@@ o ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) assure before the government budget session .
this holds true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Mo@@ F &apos;s proposal , since the social security cuts were decided already in the spending limits session of spring .
child benefit , national pension , basic unemployment security , and nearly all the other benefits ti@@ ed to national pension inde@@ x are being cut 0.@@ 85 per cent .
the dura@@ tion of ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s@@ -@@ related unemployment security will shor@@ ten from 500 days to 400 days .
the education cuts continue .
the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections are ha@@ un@@ ting
why are the ministers so eag@@ er to emphasise the very fact that there will be no new cuts on top of these ?
because next year is an election year .
the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections are in April , and they , not the p@@ oll@@ s , are the most important ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter of the electoral term .
it has been seen already before that the government parties &quot; diver@@ ging mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al election results ru@@ in the government atmosphere for a long time .
however , the p@@ oll@@ s show that there is a be@@ ating waiting the government party Finn@@ s , even though its previous election result , 12@@ .@@ 3 per cent , was modest compared to general election .
four years ago the Finn@@ s Party got 7@@ 52 new mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , most of whom will see the cost of working in a ri@@ ght@@ -@@ wing government realised next spring .
the lif@@ elin@@ e of this government of about three equ@@ al@@ -@@ sized parties h@@ ing@@ es on whether the Finn@@ s party has the ner@@ ve .
now it has@@ n &apos;@@ t , but over half of the party &apos;s voters were f@@ ed up with the government policies already during the first year .
the first signs of the party &apos;s parliamentary group &apos;s state of tur@@ bul@@ ence have sur@@ faced .
&apos;@@ T@@ here will be no new cuts &quot; rhetor@@ ic is used firstly to ob@@ sc@@ ure the fact that next year there will be har@@ sh cuts , and secondly to sof@@ ten the b@@ low that is coming to the Finn@@ s Party .
major cuts in 20@@ 18 ?
in a year everything will most likely be different - if S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä &quot; s government is still standing .
the government &apos;s goal is to break the inc@@ ur@@ ring of deb@@ ts during this parliamentary term , but in P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ p@@ o &apos;s budget proposal there is 5@@ .@@ 9 billion euros more debt contrac@@ ted next year than this year .
after the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections , the government has two options .
the first is to put their hands up already hal@@ f@@ way through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own pro@@ gra@@ m : the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness is not broken or even slow@@ ed down .
the second is to hold on to their pro@@ gra@@ m .
that means even har@@ der cuts on top of the previous ones in the 20@@ 17 government budget session .
the budget would be forced at least close to a balance during 20@@ 18 , and then , in the spring , it would be just accepting whatever is coming in the general elections .
with these actions , the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness will not be broken .
it is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness , no matter how much J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä attempts to wh@@ i@@ p up a positive atmosphere .
the gra@@ ph@@ s presented by the State Secretary Mar@@ t@@ ti H@@ e@@ te@@ m@@ ä@@ ki in the budgetary press conference prove it in@@ dispu@@ tably :
the world economy &apos;s growth predic@@ tions have , again and again , turned out to be over@@ ly positive , so there will be no support from international economy .
Finn@@ ish national economy has not r@@ isen much since the cr@@ as@@ h in 2008 , except tempor@@ arily during the stimu@@ lu@@ s policy in the beginning of the 20@@ 10@@ s .
during this decade , unemployment has increased 35 per cent and is pro@@ long@@ ed from 34 to 35 weeks on average .
unemployment now costs 3 billion euros more ann@@ ually than it did in 2008 .
the gra@@ ph@@ s presented by H@@ e@@ te@@ m@@ ä@@ ki show that the general government debt that cros@@ sed 60 per cent limit in 20@@ 14 will grow to 70 per cent hal@@ f@@ way through next decade .
what is responsible ?
in spring 2015 , the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected , because it was considered to be irresponsible .
next year the maintenance of unemployment costs about 6 billion euros , the sum that is practically fully covered by contrac@@ ting new debt .
this is the Centre Party &apos;s , the Co@@ al@@ ition Party &apos;s , and the Finn@@ s Party &apos;s idea of what is responsible .
a surve@@ y : people want to leave a lot of tasks to mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ities
three out of four thinks that organising children &apos;s day care , youth work , and physical education should be a mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity &apos;s responsibilities , reve@@ als a study by K@@ A@@ K@@ S - K@@ un@@ n@@ all@@ is@@ al@@ an ke@@ h@@ it@@ t@@ ä@@ mis@@ s@@ ä@@ ä@@ ti@@ ö ( The F@@ ound@@ ation for M@@ un@@ ic@@ ip@@ al Development ) .
a clear majority of the people shi@@ f@@ ts the responsibility on to a single mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity also when it comes to li@@ br@@ aries , culture , ad@@ ult education centres , supervision of building , up@@ per secondary school education , and waste management .
as for the prov@@ in@@ ce , the clear@@ est hop@@ ed@@ -@@ for tasks are regional land use planning , speci@@ alised health care , vo@@ ca@@ tional education , pol@@ y@@ techn@@ ics , and institutional care for men@@ tally disabled .
none of tasks that are mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ities &quot; responsibilities should be transferred to the state .

air pollution makes L@@ on@@ don@@ ers older
according to a study , L@@ on@@ don@@ ers &quot; s@@ kin ages faster than normal .
the reason for s@@ kin aging is air pollution .
evening S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard reports of a British study .
British s@@ k@@ inc@@ are firm C@@ ac@@ i analys@@ ed levels of the most tox@@ ic tiny partic@@ ula@@ tes in London to investigate their impact on the s@@ kin .
the results show that the s@@ kin of many senior London citizens will be the equivalent of tw@@ o@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years older than that of someone in the country@@ side .
this s@@ kin@@ -@@ aging fine partic@@ les are ul@@ tra@@ -@@ fine pollution d@@ ust that comes from traffic &apos;s fuel fu@@ mes .
the same partic@@ les also cause res@@ pi@@ ra@@ tory diseases that , according to E@@ ven@@ ing S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard , contribute to the deaths of nearly 9@@ ,@@ 500 L@@ on@@ don@@ ers every year .
it has been discovered in studies that the partic@@ les are small enough to pen@@ et@@ rate the s@@ kin &apos;s ou@@ ter la@@ yer .
C@@ ac@@ i &apos;s study found that pre@@ mature ageing is a risk especially to those L@@ on@@ don@@ ers who commu@@ te by w@@ al@@ king near bus@@ y roads .
inhabitants of London can attempt to protect from air pollution for example with different mas@@ ks , but a more practical solution is regular cle@@ ans@@ ing .

A@@ nne Ju@@ mp@@ pan@@ en has played in almost every flo@@ or@@ ball world cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships since 2003 .
now in Tampere it &apos;s already the sixth con@@ test going on , with the only mis@@ s from 20@@ 13 when Canada was better in North America &apos;s qualifications .
I was working in Tur@@ k@@ u and played for a local women &apos;s clu@@ b when I saw the ad .
USA is creating a national team for flo@@ or@@ ball .
I got interested , and here we are now , says 4@@ 8@@ -@@ year old Ju@@ mp@@ pan@@ en .
Ju@@ mp@@ pan@@ en was born in 19@@ 67 in the town of E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h near new York .

in 198@@ 7 , Ju@@ mp@@ pan@@ en got in to J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u Uni@@ versity to study computer science .
when I came to J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u , there was no national level in flo@@ or@@ ball yet .

it was the K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a region that ig@@ ni@@ ted the spar@@ k for sports in H@@ as@@ u , and gave a good start in a great ho@@ b@@ by .
I have many mem@@ or@@ ies from the child@@ ho@@ od .
I started playing vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y@@ ball in E@@ lim@@ ä@@ en N@@ M@@ K@@ Y &apos;s E girls when I was nine .
the main thing I remember is the over@@ sized game j@@ er@@ se@@ y , the k@@ ne@@ e pa@@ ds ro@@ lling around the an@@ kl@@ es , and the ama@@ z@@ ing che@@ ers and cho@@ re@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ies after we sco@@ red , rec@@ all@@ s H@@ as@@ u .
in a small place , a sports clu@@ b was a ti@@ ght community where everyone knew each other .
the team spirit created an atmosphere , where it was n@@ ice to play in .
everyone &apos;s families were strongly involved in the activities - a team ma@@ te &apos;s fa@@ ther was our cou@@ ch , and my mother was a long@@ -@@ time president of the clu@@ b .
for Es@@ s@@ i H@@ as@@ u , be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y was a natural choice to counter@@ balance in@@ door vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y@@ ball already when she was a j@@ uni@@ or .
be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y has been played at K@@ ä@@ yr@@ ä@@ la@@ mp@@ i be@@ ach already in the 199@@ 0s .
activity at the K@@ ä@@ ys@@ ki has always been active .
I went there myself , too , to see the j@@ uni@@ or &apos;s Finn@@ ish Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships compet@@ itions thinking that some day I would be playing there myself .
now this dream comes true , when this weekend H@@ as@@ u is playing in the F@@ C fin@@ als together with An@@ ni@@ ina Par@@ k@@ k@@ inen from Pi@@ e@@ ks@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki .
the du@@ o , ran@@ ked second in the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment after Ri@@ ik@@ ka L@@ eh@@ ton@@ en and T@@ ar@@ u La@@ h@@ ti , has a clear goal .
our realistic goal is a med@@ al .
we still don &apos;@@ t have an F@@ C g@@ old in the dis@@ play c@@ ab@@ in@@ et , H@@ as@@ u ad@@ ds m@@ yste@@ ri@@ ously .
the weekend &apos;s performance in K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a might be the last one for H@@ as@@ u in front of a familiar cro@@ w@@ d .
in the beginning of September , there will be new challenges waiting with her civilian work .
yes , my international career will be over after K@@ is@@ ak@@ all@@ io t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
anyway I plan to han@@ g my b@@ ar@@ e@@ foot sho@@ es up at least tempor@@ arily , plans H@@ as@@ u .

Sal@@ om@@ on K@@ oli bra@@ vely began as an agricultural entrepren@@ e@@ ur
agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks , s@@ we@@ at , and drive .
a young farm@@ er , 25@@ -@@ years old Sal@@ om@@ on K@@ oli became a farm@@ er , because he believes in positive future also at the country@@ side .
soon two years ago K@@ oli , together with his youn@@ ger bro@@ ther Val@@ t@@ ter@@ i K@@ oli , became continu@@ ators of his home farm .
their fa@@ ther , Mar@@ k@@ u@@ s K@@ oli , helps and advis@@ es the bro@@ thers based on his own experience .
beginning as an agricultural entrepren@@ e@@ ur meant contrac@@ ting debt and making the farm size larger , so that it would be possible to ear@@ n one &apos;s bre@@ ad from farming .
ever since I was a little bo@@ y , this has been my thing .
I &apos;@@ ve always liked bus@@ ying myself around the farm , and now that I started as an entrepren@@ e@@ ur myself , it &apos;s all in .
if you begin something , I think you should do it in ear@@ n@@ est and properly .
in 20@@ 13 we set out to build a cow sh@@ ed , and in the beginning even the bank was not enthusias@@ tic about it .
I myself was just simply all in with the project , and I &apos;@@ ve given it my everything , says Sal@@ om@@ on K@@ oli adding that he W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have entered into this project , if he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have faith in producing clean Finn@@ ish food , and in that everything will turn out to be fine .
Sal@@ om@@ on K@@ oli , who raises beef cattle , has a goal of inves@@ ting in even big@@ ger a co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
the work has paid off , because Sal@@ om@@ on K@@ oli is in the top ten of the young food producer competition organised by newspaper Ma@@ ase@@ ud@@ un Tu@@ le@@ va@@ is@@ uu@@ s .
at the moment he is compet@@ ing for the possible victory .
you can vote for Sal@@ om@@ on on the newspaper &apos;s web@@ site until 21 . August .
Bulgaria posts inflation for 1@@ st Time in 8 months
inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a mon@@ thly basis in July , national statistics show .
this is the highest value in years ( since June 20@@ 12 ) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.@@ 2 % was pos@@ ted .
the annual average inflation , measured by C@@ P@@ I , in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 20@@ 16 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 20@@ 14 - July 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price inde@@ x in July 20@@ 16 compared to June 20@@ 16 was 1@@ 01@@ .@@ 0 % , i.e. the mon@@ thly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 20@@ 16 compared to December 2015 ) has been -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 20@@ 16 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 20@@ 16 , compared to the previous month , an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods : food and n@@ on@@ -@@ alco@@ hol@@ ic b@@ ever@@ ages ( 1.@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1.@@ 8 % ) ; rec@@ re@@ ation and culture ( 6@@ .@@ 3 % ) ; res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants and ho@@ tel@@ s ( 1.@@ 2 % ) ; mis@@ cell@@ an@@ e@@ ous goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .

prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alco@@ hol@@ ic b@@ ever@@ ages and tobacco ; hous@@ ing , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communications ; and education .
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect I@@ s Cr@@ it@@ ic@@ iz@@ ed as Asian car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at says this fil@@ ter is inspi@@ red by an@@ ime , but some observers say it &apos;s ra@@ cially ins@@ ens@@ itive .
with its l@@ ens tool , S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at allows some 150 million daily users to al@@ ter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ app@@ le , a do@@ g or a character be@@ f@@ it@@ ting a Ro@@ y L@@ ic@@ h@@ ten@@ ste@@ in pain@@ ting .
the l@@ ens@@ es are b@@ lun@@ t , fe@@ a@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ war@@ ping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies a day .
any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record .
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at l@@ ens@@ es have drawn criticism in the past with accus@@ ations that the A@@ P@@ P was promoting bla@@ ck@@ face or encouraging wh@@ i@@ tened s@@ kin ton@@ es as an ideal of be@@ au@@ ty .
so when it pus@@ hed a l@@ ens to some users this week that gave them s@@ lan@@ ted eyes , distor@@ ted teet@@ h and pu@@ ff@@ y che@@ e@@ ks , some critic@@ s called it a racist car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture of Asian people - &quot; y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face . &quot;
and they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ versi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the ou@@ tra@@ ge went wide on Wednesday , with reports by The ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at said it had dismant@@ led the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the l@@ ens was meant as hom@@ age to an@@ ime char@@ ac@@ ters , not as a car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture of Asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the l@@ ens reminded them of hur@@ t@@ ful ste@@ re@@ o@@ types in action .
others round@@ ly rejected the an@@ ime comparison .
in an em@@ ai@@ l , Gra@@ ce S@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art stud@@ ent whose tw@@ eet about the p@@ ho@@ tos was widely shared , said that the l@@ ens was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and un@@ comfor@@ table to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture and the fil@@ ter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the fil@@ ter is@@ n &apos;@@ t just y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face , but y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extreme .
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at is not the only company to cross these cultural tri@@ p@@ wi@@ res .
American culture seems involved in an end@@ less struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms to H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood and the dev@@ ices we all carry in our hands .
and S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &apos;s huge au@@ di@@ ence of youn@@ ger people - who are more ra@@ cially diverse than their older counter@@ parts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &apos;s l@@ ens@@ es creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , 25@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old K@@ ati@@ e Z@@ h@@ u said in an inter@@ view on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much har@@ der for these types of things to go un@@ noticed like they did before . &quot;
on Thursday , M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , a product manag@@ er and engine@@ er who works for Med@@ i@@ um , decided to del@@ ete her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an es@@ say for Med@@ i@@ um and in a telep@@ hone inter@@ view , she said she believed that the rac@@ e@@ -@@ related contro@@ versi@@ es reflected a lack of diversity in h@@ ir@@ ing practices at S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at .
M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u critic@@ iz@@ ed the company &apos;s mos@@ tly white , all@@ -@@ m@@ ale leadership and ended her es@@ say with a has@@ h@@ ta@@ g : # Del@@ e@@ te@@ S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of col@@ or on their staff to the point where they &apos;@@ re able to make decisions like this , &quot; M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , who is C@@ hin@@ es@@ e@@ -@@ American , said , &quot; or they do have some people of col@@ or who are working there , but they &apos;@@ re not on positions where they feel safe or comfor@@ table to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at has left largely un@@ answered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , no@@ ting its status as a private company .
on Thursday , S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at dec@@ lined to discuss the ra@@ cial back@@ grounds of its staff , but according to a spo@@ kes@@ man , the company recently hi@@ red a recru@@ ite@@ r to focus on under@@ represented populations and on driving inclusion efforts intern@@ ally .
for her part , M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u said she would keep her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account closed , adding , &quot; I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O@@ .@@ K@@ . &quot;
military O@@ ffici@@ als distor@@ ted IS@@ IS I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence , Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al P@@ an@@ el says
officials from the United States Central Comm@@ and al@@ tered intelligence reports to por@@ tra@@ y a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground war@@ ran@@ ted , a Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al pan@@ el said in a report issued Thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the Re@@ public@@ an cha@@ ir@@ men of the House Ar@@ med Ser@@ vic@@ es Committee , I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence Committee and D@@ ef@@ en@@ se appropriations S@@ ub@@ committee , found &quot; widespread dis@@ satisfaction &quot; among Central Comm@@ and intelligence analys@@ ts , who said su@@ peri@@ ors were doc@@ tor@@ ing their assessments of American efforts to de@@ fe@@ at the Islamic State .
Central Comm@@ and , known as C@@ ent@@ co@@ m , is the military head@@ quarters in T@@ amp@@ a , F@@ la . , that over@@ sees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior C@@ ent@@ co@@ m leaders typ@@ ically provided a more positive de@@ pic@@ tion of U@@ .@@ S@@ . anti@@ terrorism efforts than was war@@ ran@@ ted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at C@@ ent@@ co@@ m is unacceptable - our war fi@@ gh@@ ters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said Representative K@@ en C@@ al@@ ver@@ t , Re@@ public@@ an of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia .
the leadership fa@@ ilu@@ res at C@@ ent@@ co@@ m reach to the very top of the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation .
the 10@@ -@@ page report detailed persis@@ tent problems in 20@@ 14 and 2015 in Central Comm@@ and &apos;s descri@@ ption and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Ob@@ ama administration officials ord@@ ered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red , it descri@@ bes analys@@ ts as feeling as though they were under pressure from C@@ ent@@ co@@ m leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ I@@ L .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Comm@@ and press rele@@ ases , statements and Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a C@@ ent@@ co@@ m official stated publicly that a major military assa@@ ult to take back Mos@@ u@@ l could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ u@@ l , Iraq &apos;s secon@@ d@@ -@@ largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; Representative M@@ ike P@@ om@@ pe@@ o , Re@@ public@@ an of K@@ an@@ sa@@ s , said in a statement .
from the middle of 20@@ 14 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Comm@@ and &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipu@@ lated the comm@@ and &apos;s intelligence products to down@@ play the threat from IS@@ IS in Iraq .
Re@@ public@@ ans created the task force after learning that analys@@ ts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipu@@ lated .
the report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of C@@ ent@@ co@@ m intelligence by the De@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se inspec@@ tor general .
democratic members of the House I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Re@@ public@@ an task force .
&quot; between 20@@ 14 and 2015 , C@@ ent@@ co@@ m created an over@@ ly in@@ su@@ la@@ r process for producing intelligence assessments on IS@@ I@@ L and Iraqi Security For@@ ces , &quot; Representative Ad@@ am B@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff , the committee &apos;s top Democrat , said in a statement .
this process , M@@ r@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff said , &quot; sta@@ ll@@ ed the release of intelligence products , &quot; hur@@ t mor@@ ale among analys@@ ts and &quot; in@@ sufficiently accommod@@ ated dis@@ s@@ enting views . &quot;
but M@@ r@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure C@@ ent@@ co@@ m analys@@ ts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; pres@@ et or political nar@@ ra@@ tive . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al investigation were reported Tu@@ es@@ day by The Da@@ ily be@@ ast .
last August , The New York T@@ imes reported the existence of the P@@ enta@@ g@@ on inspec@@ tor general investigation , opened after complaints by C@@ ent@@ co@@ m analys@@ ts .
L@@ t@@ . C@@ m@@ d@@ r@@ . Pat@@ ric@@ k Evans , a P@@ enta@@ g@@ on spo@@ kes@@ man , said in a statement that the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se De@@ part@@ ment would not comment on the Cong@@ res@@ sion@@ al report while the inspec@@ tor general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and De@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the Americ@@ an@@ -@@ led bom@@ bing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succ@@ eed@@ ing ( an asser@@ tion now made by a growing number of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se officials ) .
but last year &apos;s alleg@@ ations called into question how much President Ob@@ ama could rely on Central Comm@@ and for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Li@@ by@@ a and other crisis spo@@ ts .
the cr@@ iti@@ ques on the Islamic State intelligence mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r disputes of more than a decade ago , when a C@@ ent@@ co@@ m intelligence analys@@ t , G@@ reg@@ ory H@@ o@@ ok@@ er , w@@ ro@@ te a research paper saying that the administration of President George W@@ . Bush , over many analys@@ ts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 inva@@ sion .
M@@ r@@ . H@@ o@@ ok@@ er also played a key part in the in@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion over the Islamic State intelligence .
last year , officials said , M@@ r@@ . H@@ o@@ ok@@ er &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , air@@ strikes against Islamic Sta@@ te@@ -@@ held re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies had not significantly weaken@@ ed the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside Central Comm@@ and , The T@@ imes reported in September .
C@@ ent@@ co@@ m &apos;s com@@ man@@ der then , Gen@@ . L@@ loy@@ d J@@ . A@@ us@@ tin III , came under criticism last year after Sen@@ ate tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ y viewed by many law@@ makers as being an over@@ ly positive assessment of the war .
general A@@ us@@ tin reti@@ red in April and was replaced at Central Comm@@ and by Gen@@ . Jos@@ ep@@ h l@@ . V@@ o@@ te@@ l .
U@@ .@@ S@@ . w@@ ins 4@@ th S@@ tra@@ ight in Women &apos;s field ho@@ c@@ key , setting U@@ p s@@ ho@@ w@@ down W@@ it@@ h Britain
one day after sc@@ or@@ ing three goals in a 6@@ -@@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ ati@@ e B@@ am sco@@ red the first two goals for the United States women &apos;s field ho@@ c@@ key team on Thursday as the Americans de@@ fe@@ ated India , 3@@ -@@ 0 .
five goals in two g@@ ames should be a mem@@ or@@ able fe@@ at , but B@@ am , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; I have no clu@@ e , &quot; she said .
I &apos;@@ m not really one of those people who ke@@ ep@@ s track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americans are 4@@ -@@ 0 in the Olymp@@ ic t@@ our@@ na@@ ment and are ti@@ ed for first place in their group with Britain , which remained un@@ be@@ a@@ ten after de@@ fe@@ ating Japan , 2@@ -@@ 0 , on Thursday .
Britain and the United States will meet on Sa@@ tur@@ day in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quar@@ ter fin@@ als , and the game will decide who fin@@ is@@ hes first in their si@@ x@@ -@@ team b@@ rac@@ ket and who fin@@ is@@ hes second .
the fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ place fin@@ is@@ her will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other b@@ rac@@ ket , for a bit longer when the quar@@ ter fin@@ als begin .
however Sa@@ tur@@ day &apos;s game turns out , the Americans have created a sti@@ r with their surprising run here , four years after fin@@ ishing last among 12 teams at the London G@@ ames .
B@@ am was on that team .
she gre@@ w up in B@@ lu@@ e bel@@ l , P@@ a . , first pic@@ ked up a field ho@@ c@@ key stick when she was 3 ( her tw@@ in older sis@@ ters played the sport at D@@ re@@ x@@ el ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youn@@ g@@ est pla@@ yer ever .
she missed out on the 2008 Olymp@@ ics when she did not make the cut for the final ros@@ ter .
then came 20@@ 12 , when nothing much went right for her and her te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes .
the next year , C@@ ra@@ i@@ g Par@@ n@@ ha@@ m , an En@@ g@@ lis@@ h@@ man , was na@@ med the co@@ ach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the work rate in London that we have now .
we &apos;@@ ve made a complete tur@@ n@@ around .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the sc@@ or@@ ing in the first half with a back@@ hand sho@@ t from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment , but the team proved surpris@@ ingly tough and kept the sc@@ ore 1@@ -@@ 0 until late in the third period , when B@@ am took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then cur@@ led into the middle and wh@@ ip@@ ped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2@@ -@@ 0 lead .
M@@ el@@ is@@ sa G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth period .
the s@@ hu@@ t@@ out was the first of the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment for the United States go@@ ali@@ e , J@@ ac@@ ki@@ e Bri@@ gg@@ s , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three vic@@ tor@@ ies .
she is on a ro@@ l@@ l .
so is B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re in a good place right now , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ha@@ m said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Sa@@ tur@@ day &apos;s game .
a@@ mid the fur@@ y of the Olymp@@ ics , the Z@@ en of the Tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Olymp@@ ics .
the events in Rio de J@@ an@@ eir@@ o feel constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a fu@@ ri@@ ous rela@@ y of competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the Olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself were a fla@@ ming b@@ aton , passed from Ar@@ ch@@ er to sw@@ im@@ mer to g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast to tri@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;@@ t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neigh@@ b@@ or &apos;s conver@@ sa@@ tion in a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e@@ -@@ sho@@ p line without hearing about S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , K@@ ati@@ e L@@ ed@@ ec@@ ky or the fe@@ ud between Mic@@ ha@@ el P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ lo@@ s .
and then there is L@@ og@@ an Do@@ ol@@ e@@ y .
M@@ r@@ . Do@@ ol@@ e@@ y , a fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ time Olymp@@ ian and a d@@ impl@@ ed hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b in the making , may well be among those hou@@ se@@ hold names being s@@ ho@@ w@@ c@@ ased in prime time , bu@@ o@@ yed by spon@@ sor@@ ships and fe@@ el@@ -@@ good T@@ V commer@@ ci@@ als , if he were a sw@@ im@@ mer , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or even a f@@ enc@@ er .
but M@@ r@@ . Do@@ ol@@ e@@ y , 28 , of La@@ ke For@@ est , C@@ al@@ if . , is compet@@ ing for the g@@ old in Olymp@@ ic tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
the Olymp@@ ic fla@@ me does not ill@@ u@@ min@@ ate each event equally .
further from the cen@@ ter , partly in shadow , are those sports not univers@@ ally acknowledged : air@@ -@@ p@@ is@@ to@@ l sho@@ ot@@ ing , arch@@ ery , b@@ ad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ e@@ k@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the b@@ reas@@ t@@ s@@ tro@@ ke , and long may it re@@ ign .
but if I may make a modest case for my particular fav@@ or@@ ite , let me call attention to the discre@@ et char@@ m of the tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
though tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine has been an Olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it deb@@ u@@ ted at the S@@ yd@@ ney G@@ ames , it has spent the interven@@ ing 16 years so bar@@ ely acknowledged that many I surve@@ yed did not re@@ ali@@ ze it was an Olymp@@ ic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignor@@ ance .
despite sending a@@ th@@ le@@ tes to compete , the United States has never won a med@@ al in tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine and did not have an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete advance to the fin@@ als until 20@@ 12 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ si@@ ans tend to split the pri@@ z@@ es for the men , and the Chinese and the Can@@ ad@@ ians for the women .
d@@ ong d@@ ong of China and Ro@@ si@@ e Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an of Canada will be defending their London g@@ old med@@ als this year .
but there is an under@@ do@@ g char@@ m to tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , in part because it s@@ ounds , to the un@@ en@@ li@@ gh@@ tened e@@ ar , f@@ itte@@ r for c@@ lo@@ wn coll@@ ege than the Olymp@@ ics .
here I should conf@@ ess that I am no expert , just an ear@@ th@@ bound en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ ast .
it does have com@@ ic potential - the car@@ to@@ on qu@@ a@@ ver of its ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending b@@ oun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ ce of g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics and di@@ ving , the two sports it essentially comb@@ ines .
the word &quot; tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine &quot; deriv@@ es from the Spanish el tra@@ m@@ pol@@ í@@ n , meaning &quot; di@@ ving board . &quot;
as@@ p@@ iring cha@@ mp@@ ions j@@ um@@ p on a gi@@ ant tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , sho@@ ot@@ ing up to nearly 30 fe@@ et in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tu@@ m@@ b@@ ling moves ( tw@@ ists , p@@ ik@@ es and s@@ om@@ er@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts ) before eventually lan@@ ding on their fe@@ et .
they are jud@@ ged on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time , &quot; according to the official Olymp@@ ic pro@@ gra@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ two a@@ th@@ le@@ tes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olymp@@ ic v@@ ec@@ tor is straight ahead .
med@@ al hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ s must go far@@ ther , faster , up and over , in their ques@@ t for g@@ old , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are ch@@ asing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the tel@@ ev@@ ised cover@@ age , another ta@@ un@@ ting line : that of the world , or Olymp@@ ic , record .
this sing@@ le@@ -@@ min@@ ded pursu@@ it is no@@ ble , admi@@ ra@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to bring even a spec@@ ta@@ tor to te@@ ars .

&quot; a G@@ ener@@ ation I@@ s protes@@ ting &quot; in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , L@@ ong a U@@ .@@ S@@ . ally
violent protes@@ ts in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia
demonstra@@ tors demanding political change in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witn@@ esses say that sco@@ res of protes@@ ters have been fa@@ tally sho@@ t during clas@@ hes with police .
is E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia about to c@@ rac@@ k ?
for the last decade , it has been one Africa &apos;s most stable nations , a solid Western ally with a fas@@ t@@ -@@ growing economy .
but in recent months , anti@@ -@@ government protes@@ ts have con@@ v@@ ul@@ sed the country , spre@@ ading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stor@@ med into the stre@@ ets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ru@@ th@@ less .
witn@@ esses said that police officers sho@@ t and killed sco@@ res of un@@ armed demonstra@@ tors .
v@@ ide@@ os circ@@ ula@@ ting from protes@@ ts thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers wh@@ ip@@ ping young people with stic@@ ks as they were forced to perform hand@@ stands against a wall .
the top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even har@@ der , &quot; said R@@ as@@ hi@@ d Ab@@ di , the H@@ or@@ n of Africa project direc@@ tor for the International C@@ ris@@ is Group , a research group .
E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia is the second most popul@@ ous nation in Africa , after Nigeria , and its stability is ch@@ er@@ ished by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the E@@ thi@@ op@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Som@@ alia , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid .
E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s economy has been expan@@ ding at an im@@ pressive c@@ li@@ p .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is even a new commu@@ ter train in the capital , Ad@@ d@@ is Ab@@ ab@@ a .
and its stre@@ ets are typ@@ ically qui@@ et , safe and clean .
though E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia has hardly been a par@@ ag@@ on of democracy - human rights groups have constantly ci@@ ted the government &apos;s repres@@ si@@ veness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dis@@ sid@@ ents effectively sil@@ enc@@ ed .
many have been ex@@ iled , ja@@ iled , killed or driven to the far reaches of the deser@@ t .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ate people and they don &apos;@@ t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ y@@ ou@@ m T@@ es@@ home , a university lec@@ tu@@ rer in central E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia .
the whole youth is protes@@ ting .
a generation is protes@@ ting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition &apos;s str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold on power .
after a widely critic@@ iz@@ ed election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 perc@@ ent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions are rising along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle along that j@@ ag@@ ged , dispu@@ ted line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
analys@@ ts fear that separ@@ at@@ ist groups that had been more or less van@@ qu@@ ished in recent years , like the O@@ ro@@ mo Liber@@ ation F@@ ront or the O@@ g@@ ad@@ en National Liber@@ ation F@@ ront , may try to exploit the tur@@ bul@@ ence and re@@ arm .
several factors explain why b@@ itte@@ r feelings , after years of si@@ m@@ mer@@ ing bene@@ ath the sur@@ face , are explo@@ ding now .
the first is se@@ em@@ ingly in@@ no@@ cu@@ ous : s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ians been able to communicate using social media as che@@ aper s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es became common and inter@@ net service improved .
even when the government s@@ hu@@ ts down access to F@@ ace@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter , as it frequently does , especially during protes@@ ts , many people are still able to communicate via inter@@ net pro@@ x@@ ies that m@@ ask where they are .
several young E@@ thi@@ op@@ ians said this was how they gather@@ ed for protes@@ ts .
second , there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups .
O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural allies .
for e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as from E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s pre@@ domin@@ antly Christian hi@@ gh@@ lands f@@ lou@@ ris@@ hed in politics and business , explo@@ iting the O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s , many of whom are Mus@@ li@@ m and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordinate under one um@@ bre@@ lla , &quot; said M@@ ula@@ t@@ u G@@ em@@ ech@@ u , an O@@ ro@@ mo leader .
the biggest protes@@ ts have been in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mo areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s feel E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia is un@@ fairly domin@@ ated by members of the Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ an ethnic group , which makes up about 6 perc@@ ent of the population and domin@@ ates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the un@@ rest is the loss of M@@ el@@ es Z@@ en@@ aw@@ i .
M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an und@@ is@@ closed ill@@ ness in 20@@ 12 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ i@@ us , a man who could see around cor@@ ners .
analys@@ ts say he was especially ad@@ ep@@ t at detec@@ ting early signals of dis@@ content and using em@@ is@@ s@@ aries to massa@@ ge and def@@ an@@ g opponents .
&quot; the current regime la@@ cks that ground sa@@ v@@ v@@ y , &quot; M@@ r@@ . Ab@@ di , the conflict analys@@ t , said .
E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new prime minister , Ha@@ ilem@@ ari@@ am D@@ es@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was plu@@ cked from relative ob@@ s@@ cur@@ ity to fill M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es &apos;s sho@@ es .
unlike M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es , who came from the Ti@@ gra@@ y region of northern E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , M@@ r@@ . Ha@@ ilem@@ ari@@ am is a sou@@ ther@@ ner .
analys@@ ts say he does not have the trust of the Ti@@ gra@@ yan@@ -@@ controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ed .
the last time E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protes@@ ted over what analys@@ ts have said appeared to be an election the government bun@@ g@@ led and then st@@ ole .
in the ensu@@ ing c@@ rac@@ k@@ down , many protes@@ ters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have p@@ raised E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s leaders for visi@@ on@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and me@@ as@@ ura@@ ble str@@ ides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal res@@ ent@@ ment of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s government from intensi@@ fying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protes@@ ters in G@@ on@@ d@@ ar , an Am@@ har@@ a town , atta@@ cked businesses ow@@ ned by Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ ans , and anti@@ -@@ Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ an hat@@ red is becoming more common in social media .
analys@@ ts say the protes@@ ts are putting the United States and other Western allies in an aw@@ k@@ ward position .
the American government has used E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia as a base for d@@ r@@ one flights over neigh@@ bor@@ ing Som@@ alia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already vol@@ ati@@ le region to cr@@ um@@ ble .
&quot; that , &quot; M@@ r@@ . Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very ti@@ ght ro@@ pe to w@@ al@@ k . &quot;
D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p expla@@ ins H@@ is O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ F@@ oun@@ ded@@ -@@ IS@@ IS claim as &quot; s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
D@@ on@@ al@@ d J@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tried to qu@@ as@@ h the latest contro@@ vers@@ y eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing his campaign on Friday by claim@@ ing that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Ob@@ ama and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton were the &quot; foun@@ ders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the Re@@ public@@ an presidential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e &apos;s ability to communicate clearly to the American public .
it also put his sur@@ ro@@ ga@@ tes , who have stra@@ ined to defend him during a tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous stre@@ t@@ ch , in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a r@@ ally on Wednesday night , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p doub@@ led down on the asser@@ tion on Thursday , insis@@ ting in inter@@ views that he really did intend to say that the president and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an ear@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ morning T@@ wit@@ ter post on Friday , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p said that he was just being s@@ ar@@ cas@@ tic .
the post was a re@@ vers@@ al from just a day ago , when M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p said in a number of inter@@ views that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the con@@ serva@@ tive radio host Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t tried to help M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p sof@@ ten the remark by remin@@ ding him that M@@ r@@ . Ob@@ ama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Re@@ public@@ an presidential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e would not have it .
the latest fi@@ restor@@ m comes as M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has been trying to ref@@ oc@@ us his campaign on the economy a@@ mid dec@@ lining pol@@ l numbers .
M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton gave du@@ el@@ ing economic speeches in Mic@@ hi@@ gan this week .
on Friday , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to T@@ wit@@ ter , he war@@ ned that M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech bor@@ ing .
M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has used the s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m D@@ ef@@ en@@ se before .
in late July , after he drew widespread criticism by appe@@ aring to suggest that the Rus@@ si@@ ans should ha@@ ck M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s em@@ a@@ ils , he later explained his remarks by saying , &quot; O@@ f course I &apos;@@ m being s@@ ar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
the approach allows M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p to push the limits of political speech and di@@ al it back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s a pat@@ tern of him testing certain messages that res@@ on@@ ate with his f@@ ans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clari@@ fying &quot; one way or another depending on the reaction , &quot; said Ru@@ th S@@ her@@ man , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s cle@@ ver about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be fil@@ tered through various l@@ ens@@ es .
instead of ton@@ ing things down for a general election au@@ di@@ ence , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has taken an even more ca@@ us@@ tic tone in recent days as his pol@@ l numbers have continued to tu@@ m@@ ble .
a new N@@ B@@ C / W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal / Mar@@ ist pol@@ l released on Friday showed M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tra@@ iling M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton by large mar@@ g@@ ins in North Car@@ ol@@ ina , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o and loc@@ ked in a ti@@ ght race in Flor@@ ida .
while M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p generally tries to avoid a@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ z@@ ing for provo@@ ca@@ tive things that he says , he often acc@@ uses his critic@@ s of mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ing his words or mis@@ understanding his sense of hu@@ m@@ or .
but as he faces he@@ i@@ gh@@ tened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s jo@@ kes have put his loy@@ al allies in the un@@ comfor@@ table position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provo@@ ca@@ tive his remarks .
R@@ ud@@ ol@@ p@@ h W@@ . Gi@@ uli@@ ani , the former New York C@@ ity may@@ or who is one of M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s most pro@@ minent sur@@ ro@@ ga@@ tes , went to great l@@ eng@@ ths to defend the candidate in an inter@@ view with C@@ N@@ N on Thursday .
&quot; I think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political com@@ mentary , &quot; M@@ r@@ . Gi@@ uli@@ ani said when ques@@ tioned about the ver@@ ac@@ ity of M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s asser@@ tion about M@@ r@@ . Ob@@ ama and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton having founded the Islamic State .
it is true in a sense that before Ob@@ ama , IS@@ IS was an almost un@@ known , small little Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation , he who called it the ja@@ y@@ ve@@ e , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the Ob@@ ama administration , in which M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton served as secre@@ tary of state , allowed IS@@ IS to f@@ es@@ ter by failing to aggres@@ sively manage the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of r@@ allies in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia on Friday , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p continued to las@@ h out on T@@ wit@@ ter at the news media for har@@ ping on his every word and for being bi@@ ased against him .
he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , pa@@ thetic &quot; television pun@@ d@@ its who try to figure him out and said , &quot; T@@ he@@ y can &apos;@@ t ! &quot;
some Democrats sco@@ ff@@ ed at M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s excuse as more evidence that he is un@@ fit to be president .
once pr@@ ic@@ ed O@@ ut , a C@@ af@@ e re@@ turns in Gre@@ en@@ point
ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e was a sha@@ b@@ by , c@@ ash@@ -@@ only space in W@@ illi@@ am@@ s@@ burg that had no Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i but served good co@@ ff@@ ee for 15 years .
naturally , it got pr@@ ic@@ ed out of its B@@ ed@@ for@@ d a@@ ven@@ ue sto@@ ref@@ ront .
the stor@@ e that replaced the ver@@ b in the summer of 20@@ 14 , so@@ ap C@@ her@@ i@@ e , sell@@ s so@@ aps in the shape of c@@ up@@ ca@@ kes .
loc@@ als b@@ emo@@ an@@ ed it as the latest loss in a g@@ ent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artis@@ t M@@ oll@@ y C@@ ra@@ b@@ app@@ le w@@ ro@@ te on T@@ wit@@ ter , &quot; New York is change , I know , but still , can &apos;@@ t believe C@@ B@@ G@@ B &apos;s is dead and the C@@ hel@@ sea H@@ o@@ te@@ l is gu@@ t@@ ted and ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap sho@@ p . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also re@@ in@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e opened last November in Gre@@ en@@ point , less than a mil@@ e north of the original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar un@@ pre@@ ten@@ tious vi@@ be .
the co@@ ff@@ ee is still good , too .
leading the new ver@@ b is C@@ is@@ co R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time employe@@ e at the old CA@@ F@@ E who is an ow@@ ner and the general manag@@ er at the new place .
he started at ver@@ b in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a custom@@ er offered to ban@@ k@@ ro@@ l@@ l him in a new out@@ post , he said he was ex@@ ci@@ ted to do it .
M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
ver@@ b uses the same distribu@@ tor for the b@@ ag@@ els and b@@ ought the same model of es@@ pres@@ so mach@@ ine .
it even re@@ used the li@@ ghts from the old ver@@ b .
but M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he also wanted to exper@@ iment .
he introduced new ingredients .
B@@ ac@@ on@@ -@@ eg@@ g@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ che@@ ese san@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ hes are on the men@@ u , and to@@ pp@@ ings like ca@@ per@@ s and sa@@ ut@@ é@@ ed on@@ ions are available .
there are bro@@ w@@ n@@ -@@ ric@@ e b@@ ow@@ ls .
the CA@@ F@@ E no longer serves be@@ er but now makes fresh ju@@ ices .
nine months in , M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a stead@@ y stre@@ am of old regul@@ ars .
&quot; a lot of former customers got pr@@ ic@@ ed out of W@@ illi@@ am@@ s@@ burg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent S@@ und@@ ay , Re@@ b@@ ec@@ ca O@@ li@@ ve@@ ira was one such custom@@ er .
M@@ S@@ . O@@ li@@ ve@@ ira , 34 , used to live in W@@ illi@@ am@@ s@@ burg and went to ver@@ b frequently .
even after she moved to Gre@@ en@@ point , she would still make the tre@@ k .
after ver@@ b closed , she said , she gave up drinking co@@ ff@@ ee for a while .
&quot; I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed it was the co@@ ff@@ ee and the culture at ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on co@@ ff@@ ee , although that day , instead of her usual ic@@ ed co@@ ff@@ ee , she went with a b@@ len@@ ded cha@@ i drin@@ k , another new addition .
T@@ om R@@ os@@ en@@ th@@ al , another long@@ time custom@@ er , went fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully to ver@@ b starting in 2003 .
he &apos;@@ d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quar@@ ter past seven , every day , like c@@ loc@@ k@@ work , I &apos;@@ d come in and they were making my everything b@@ ag@@ el with bu@@ tter , &quot; he said .
p@@ ho@@ to M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to exper@@ iment and introduced new ingredients to the men@@ u .
these days , M@@ r@@ . R@@ os@@ en@@ th@@ al still gets his regular order , but sometimes he &apos;@@ l@@ l s@@ wit@@ ch things up with the bac@@ on , eg@@ g and che@@ ese on an everything b@@ ag@@ el .
M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no hard feelings about the so@@ ap sho@@ p taking over the old space .
in fact , the so@@ ap C@@ her@@ i@@ e owners offered to make special so@@ ap for ver@@ b , using the CA@@ F@@ E &apos;s col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed co@@ ff@@ ee as an ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent .
&quot; I think we still might take them up on it , &quot; M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said .
and Gre@@ en@@ point &apos;s traditional Pol@@ ish resid@@ ents have emb@@ rac@@ ed the CA@@ F@@ E as well .
one of these new customers trans@@ lated the men@@ u into Pol@@ ish , and M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he planned to find a spo@@ t to dis@@ play it soon to make his new neigh@@ b@@ ors feel welcome .
the new location has other per@@ ks .
a local ju@@ ice spo@@ t wants to bot@@ t@@ le and sell the col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed co@@ ff@@ ee .
there is a chance the CA@@ F@@ E will exp@@ and into an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b to get their old fav@@ or@@ ite@@ s is enough .
Jos@@ ep@@ h Wh@@ it@@ t was a regular and said he was hear@@ t@@ broken when they closed .
when the new space opened , M@@ r@@ . Wh@@ it@@ t said , w@@ al@@ king in and getting a co@@ ff@@ ee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ om@@ ing .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve needed to sm@@ ell that , &quot; he said .

C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons ear@@ ned $ 10@@ .@@ 75 million in 2015 , paid 3@@ 4@@ .@@ 2 perc@@ ent federal tax rate
H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton on Friday released her 2015 tax re@@ turns , which showed the Democratic presidential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e and her h@@ us@@ b@@ and had $ 10@@ .@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4@@ .@@ 2 perc@@ ent .
in 2015 , the C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons made $ 1 million in char@@ itable contributions , mos@@ tly to the C@@ lin@@ ton F@@ ound@@ ation ; former President B@@ ill C@@ lin@@ ton brought in nearly $ 5@@ .@@ 3 million in speaking fe@@ es ; and the former secre@@ tary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publis@@ her S@@ im@@ on &amp; Sch@@ us@@ ter for her book on her ten@@ ure at the State De@@ part@@ ment .
C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s running ma@@ te , U@@ .@@ S@@ . Sen@@ ator Ti@@ m K@@ ain@@ e of Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , along with his wi@@ fe , A@@ nne Hol@@ ton , released 10 years of tax re@@ turns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20@@ .@@ 3 perc@@ ent in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton and Ti@@ m K@@ ain@@ e continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton campaign a@@ ide J@@ enni@@ f@@ er Pal@@ mi@@ er@@ i said in a statement .
in star@@ k contrast , D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p is hid@@ ing behind fa@@ ke ex@@ cus@@ es and back@@ trac@@ king on his previous promises to release his tax re@@ turns .
it is custom@@ ary for U@@ .@@ S@@ . presidential candidates to make their tax re@@ turns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
tr@@ um@@ p , a New York busin@@ ess@@ man , and his lawyers have ci@@ ted an audit by the Internal R@@ even@@ ue Ser@@ vice as a reason for his refusal to release his re@@ turns .
&quot; your move , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton campaign a@@ ide I@@ an S@@ ams said on T@@ wit@@ ter , lin@@ king to the Democratic n@@ om@@ ine@@ e &apos;s re@@ turns .
on Thursday , tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s special coun@@ sel , Mic@@ ha@@ el C@@ oh@@ en , told C@@ N@@ N he would not allow tr@@ um@@ p to release them until the aud@@ its are complete .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s critic@@ s , including 20@@ 12 Re@@ public@@ an presidential candidate Mit@@ t R@@ om@@ ney and other fellow Re@@ public@@ ans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his char@@ itable contributions , his business deal@@ ings and various other ties , including with Russia .
C@@ lin@@ ton has p@@ oun@@ ced on the issue , rele@@ asing an on@@ line v@@ ide@@ o on Friday highli@@ ghting hi@@ gh@@ -@@ profile Re@@ public@@ ans urg@@ ing tr@@ um@@ p to release his taxes .
on Thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Mic@@ hi@@ gan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax re@@ turns , &quot; she told the cro@@ w@@ d .
politic@@ o has reported that tr@@ um@@ p paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 199@@ 0s , and a New York T@@ imes business c@@ olum@@ n@@ ist on Friday quo@@ ted a number of tax lawyers and accoun@@ tants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
C@@ lin@@ ton has endorsed a rule na@@ med after bill@@ i@@ on@@ air@@ e inves@@ tor W@@ ar@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 perc@@ ent .
President Bar@@ ac@@ k Ob@@ ama also backs the proposal .
at a C@@ lin@@ ton r@@ ally last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , N@@ eb@@ ras@@ ka , Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t , whose Ber@@ ks@@ h@@ ire Ha@@ th@@ away con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate is based there , challeng@@ ed tr@@ um@@ p to meet and exchange tax re@@ turns .
Bu@@ ff@@ et said that he too was under I@@ R@@ S audit and tr@@ um@@ p is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax@@ -@@ collection agency but of voters .
C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s campaign has released tax re@@ turns going back to 2007 .
the C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons , who now live in C@@ hap@@ pa@@ qu@@ a , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 perc@@ ent from 2007 to 20@@ 14 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.@@ 5 perc@@ ent .
the C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most Americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low@@ -@@ cost inde@@ x mutual fund , and the C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons reported divid@@ end and interest income of $ 10@@ 9@@ ,@@ 000 .

Je@@ wish fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker sla@@ ms Berlin ho@@ te@@ l for removing Israel di@@ al code after Arab &quot; request &quot; - R@@ T Ne@@ ws
a French fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker of Je@@ wish origin un@@ le@@ as@@ hed a media f@@ uro@@ r after he revealed that the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l ho@@ te@@ l in Berlin does not list Israel &apos;s di@@ al code , with employe@@ e c@@ iting &quot; requests &quot; from Ara@@ b@@ ic customers .
C@@ la@@ ude Lan@@ z@@ mann , an author of Hol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust docu@@ mentary &quot; S@@ ho@@ ah , &quot; ven@@ ted his frustra@@ tion at the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l H@@ o@@ te@@ l in Berlin , writing an open letter in the German out@@ let FA@@ Z .
during his recent stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel in the list of di@@ al cod@@ es provided by the ho@@ te@@ l .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 20@@ 16 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was elimin@@ ated and erad@@ icated ?
Lan@@ z@@ mann w@@ ro@@ te .
instead , K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l offers an opportunity to di@@ al Israel via an own call cen@@ ter .
seeking explanation , the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker addressed the issue at the ho@@ te@@ l &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , Lan@@ z@@ mann w@@ ro@@ te &quot; sho@@ cked him . &quot;
the ho@@ te@@ l &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki@@ -@@ H@@ o@@ tel@@ s . &quot;
the reason behind the move tri@@ gg@@ ered even more ou@@ tra@@ ge by the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker .
&quot; the majority of our gu@@ es@@ ts are Ara@@ bs and they demanded Israel &apos;s code to be dele@@ ted , &quot; the employe@@ e was quo@@ ted as saying by Lan@@ z@@ mann .
Israeli amb@@ assa@@ dor to Germany Y@@ a@@ ko@@ v H@@ ad@@ as@@ -@@ H@@ an@@ del@@ s@@ man called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung reports .
we were app@@ all@@ ed and sho@@ cked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very ho@@ te@@ l chain , is an even greater disgra@@ ce .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the ho@@ te@@ l dra@@ ws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident tri@@ gg@@ ered quite a response on@@ line , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleg@@ ed that the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki ho@@ te@@ l simply &quot; ca@@ ved in &quot; to the alleg@@ ed demands of Ara@@ b@@ ic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the ho@@ te@@ l , located in the no@@ ble Kur@@ fur@@ s@@ tend@@ am@@ m stre@@ et stands near a S@@ yn@@ ago@@ gue .
the ho@@ te@@ l itself was quick to br@@ us@@ h off any accus@@ ations , calling what happened an &quot; over@@ sight &quot; and &quot; a@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ z@@ ing &quot; to Lan@@ z@@ mann , D@@ er S@@ pi@@ e@@ ge@@ l reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the fast di@@ al list , &quot; Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung quo@@ ted a K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki representative as saying .
it ad@@ ds that the code was now added .
police use te@@ ar gas &amp; ru@@ b@@ ber bu@@ ll@@ ets against protes@@ ting Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian students
students clas@@ hed with police in the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian city of Sa@@ o Paul@@ o on Thursday as they gather@@ ed to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used te@@ ar gas and ru@@ b@@ ber bu@@ ll@@ ets against the protes@@ ters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to dis@@ per@@ se the students , which led to the police using ru@@ b@@ ber bu@@ ll@@ ets and te@@ ar gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dis@@ may at the plans .
under proposals from the govern@@ or of the state of Sa@@ o Paul@@ o Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 students will be re@@ located in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i on the w@@ all@@ s against the interim President Michel Tem@@ er .
this latest protest comes just days after protes@@ ters took to the stre@@ ets en mas@@ se to support suspended President D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff as the country &apos;s sen@@ ate voted for her impe@@ ac@@ hment .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran sur@@ ges 71 % - R@@ T Bus@@ iness
with the lif@@ ting of sanctions , trade tur@@ no@@ ver between Mos@@ cow and T@@ eh@@ ran has grown 7@@ 0.@@ 9 perc@@ ent in ye@@ ar@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year terms , according to Russia &apos;s amb@@ assa@@ dor to Iran , L@@ ev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an .
since international sanctions against Iran were lif@@ ted , there has been a sur@@ ge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country , the amb@@ assa@@ dor said .
Russian companies are res@@ um@@ ing existing ties with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an said .
he noted that in the first five months of 20@@ 16 the trade tur@@ no@@ ver between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 perc@@ ent compared to the same period of 2015 and amoun@@ ted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian exports to Iran ju@@ mp@@ ed by 9@@ 1.@@ 5 perc@@ ent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 perc@@ ent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of mach@@ in@@ ery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the amb@@ assa@@ dor said .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an is also expec@@ ting a record number of Iran@@ ian touris@@ ts to visit Russia this year .
last year , the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 visas , mos@@ tly travel , to Iran@@ ian citizens .
in addition , for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of touris@@ ts vis@@ iting Russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of Iran@@ ian touris@@ ts vis@@ iting Russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Rus@@ si@@ ans are vis@@ iting Iran , something the amb@@ assa@@ dor hopes will change .
&quot; I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Is@@ fa@@ han , S@@ hi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preser@@ ved mon@@ u@@ ments of an@@ ci@@ ent Per@@ sian civil@@ iz@@ ation in good condition , &quot; he said .
sco@@ t C@@ all@@ um S@@ k@@ inner stor@@ ms home as Br@@ its gra@@ b cy@@ cl@@ ing g@@ old
Scotland &apos;s C@@ all@@ um S@@ k@@ inner rac@@ ed to gl@@ ory in the men &apos;s team s@@ prin@@ t at the Rio vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me last night as the T@@ e@@ am G@@ B tri@@ o def@@ ended the title from London 20@@ 12 .
the G@@ las@@ we@@ gian 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old was in the an@@ ch@@ or role that his fellow Scot@@ s@@ man S@@ ir Ch@@ ris H@@ o@@ y made his own and the youn@@ g@@ s@@ ter did the leg@@ end proud as he stor@@ med home to s@@ n@@ at@@ ch victory from the favoured New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and out@@ fit .
Britain claimed a sho@@ ck victory four years ago to win as H@@ o@@ y claimed the fifth of his six Olymp@@ ic g@@ ol@@ ds .
and they repeated the tric@@ k after fin@@ ishing a low@@ ly sixth at March &apos;s T@@ rac@@ k World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in London , despite H@@ o@@ y having since reti@@ red .
the issue between Beij@@ ing and London was re@@ placing speci@@ alist star@@ ter J@@ a@@ mi@@ e Sta@@ ff .
they did so just in time as H@@ ind@@ es emerged .
H@@ o@@ y &apos;s retirement also created a vo@@ id which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Mat@@ t C@@ ra@@ mp@@ ton tried to fill .
S@@ k@@ inner was the man Britain &apos;s co@@ ac@@ hes stu@@ ck with , seeing potential in the S@@ co@@ t which has now been realised .
H@@ ind@@ es , K@@ enn@@ y - cha@@ mp@@ ions with H@@ o@@ y four years ago - and S@@ k@@ inner set an Olymp@@ ic record in quali@@ fying , but the standard was over@@ taken by New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in the first round .
and the British tri@@ o won the du@@ el for g@@ old .
H@@ ind@@ es was nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly behind after his la@@ p , but K@@ enn@@ y pus@@ hed the team in front and S@@ k@@ inner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the trans@@ formation , with H@@ ind@@ es rid@@ ing a big@@ ger ge@@ ar to slow him down and allow K@@ enn@@ y and , in particular , S@@ k@@ inner to keep pace .
H@@ o@@ y wat@@ ched on from his position as a B@@ B@@ C pun@@ d@@ it and caught the eye of S@@ k@@ inner , K@@ enn@@ y and H@@ ind@@ es when they ste@@ pped on to the po@@ di@@ um .
the 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old S@@ k@@ inner , from G@@ las@@ go@@ w , said : &quot; it &apos;s a fla@@ t@@ tering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an Olymp@@ ic record in the final and be@@ at the world cha@@ mp@@ ions .
it was just incredi@@ ble .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after tri@@ ump@@ hing at London 20@@ 12 alongside K@@ enn@@ y and H@@ o@@ y , H@@ ind@@ es ad@@ mitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later re@@ trac@@ ted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain &apos;s ri@@ val@@ s .
there was no such issue this time around in a su@@ pre@@ me victory .
H@@ ind@@ es said : &quot; it felt like London , with all the G@@ B flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;@@ ve been losing out on so many world tit@@ les , so to win the Olymp@@ ics again is just ama@@ z@@ ing .
that is one event , one g@@ old med@@ al for the nation which won seven out of 10 track tit@@ les in both Beij@@ ing and London .
if that is a bar@@ om@@ e@@ ter of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me a@@ wa@@ its .
with the form K@@ enn@@ y demonstrated , it is not beyond the re@@ al@@ ms of possibility to imagine him repe@@ ating H@@ o@@ y &apos;s fe@@ at of w@@ inning three Olymp@@ ic g@@ ol@@ ds in one G@@ ames .
that would see K@@ enn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years youn@@ ger than H@@ o@@ y , who is also born on 23 March ( that se@@ em@@ ingly sa@@ c@@ red date in British sport which is also the bir@@ th@@ day of Ste@@ ve Red@@ grave , M@@ o F@@ ar@@ ah and R@@ og@@ er B@@ ann@@ is@@ ter ) - take his tally to six g@@ old med@@ als and one sil@@ ver .
that would be the same as H@@ o@@ y &apos;s .
K@@ enn@@ y next compe@@ tes in the s@@ prin@@ t , which beg@@ ins on today and plays out over three days .
the 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old from B@@ ol@@ ton said : &quot; I &apos;@@ m just enjo@@ ying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your ma@@ tes .
it &apos;s a bit l@@ on@@ ely w@@ inning on your own to be honest .
H@@ ind@@ es said : &quot; if he w@@ ins another two g@@ old med@@ als , he should get a k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only med@@ al event , but there was further good news for Britain .
S@@ ir B@@ rad@@ ley W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , E@@ D C@@ lan@@ cy , Ste@@ ven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in D@@ oul@@ l qualified fas@@ test in the four@@ -@@ man , four@@ -@@ kilomet@@ res team pursu@@ it .
they finished in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 43 .
the world record , set in w@@ inning g@@ old at London 20@@ 12 , is 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round and final ( 10@@ .@@ 4@@ 2@@ p@@ m ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with com@@ mis@@ sa@@ i@@ res yesterday ahead of the quali@@ fication r@@ ide , when officials sum@@ mon@@ ed him to measure his he@@ ight .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which res@@ um@@ es and concludes tomorrow , La@@ ur@@ a T@@ ro@@ t@@ t , J@@ o@@ ann@@ a R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ ati@@ e Ar@@ chi@@ b@@ al@@ d of M@@ il@@ n@@ ga@@ vi@@ e advanced in a world record time , c@@ loc@@ king 4 : 13@@ .@@ 2@@ 60 .
team G@@ B have come to rely on its mi@@ gh@@ ty track cy@@ cl@@ ing squ@@ ad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olymp@@ ic G@@ ames and deliver a host of med@@ als .
after truly exceptional s@@ ho@@ w@@ ings of ut@@ ter domin@@ ance at Beij@@ ing and London , expectations have been played down in the le@@ ad@@ -@@ up to Rio .
there have been dra@@ mas in the background , not least the res@@ ig@@ nation of technical direc@@ tor S@@ han@@ e S@@ ut@@ ton in April a@@ mid sex@@ ism and bu@@ ll@@ ying alleg@@ ations , and the reti@@ re@@ ments of gi@@ ant figures like H@@ o@@ y and V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s rac@@ ing in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me , it looks like G@@ B &apos;s now leg@@ end@@ ary repu@@ tation for pe@@ a@@ king at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
P@@ or@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter &apos;s future in doubt with a@@ x@@ ing of power contract
the future of the P@@ or@@ t@@ land alu@@ min@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter in V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant dis@@ closing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to termin@@ ate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be a@@ xed .
the move follows the decision of the V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20@@ -@@ year fixed subsidy ex@@ pi@@ res in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s P@@ or@@ t@@ land plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on effects since the sm@@ el@@ ter consum@@ es around 10 per cent of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s entire electricity out@@ put .
in 20@@ 14 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Po@@ int H@@ en@@ ry sm@@ el@@ ter which led to the closure last year of the Ang@@ les@@ e@@ a power plant .
Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s P@@ or@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ian dollar and more recently due to the price for the out@@ put from the plant .
A@@ G@@ L , which supplies the big alu@@ min@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter with electricity from its L@@ o@@ y Y@@ an@@ g A power plant in the Lat@@ ro@@ be V@@ alle@@ y , said it ex@@ pects the other three owners will also move to termin@@ ate their agreements .
the plant is majority ow@@ ned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and A@@ lu@@ mina , with China &apos;s C@@ IT@@ I@@ C and Japan &apos;s Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
&quot; A@@ G@@ L ex@@ pects the P@@ or@@ t@@ land facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the sm@@ el@@ ter will continue , &quot; it said .
A@@ G@@ L said the contracts are so@@ -@@ called &apos; h@@ ed@@ ging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from November 20@@ 16 .
the contracts have a 12@@ -@@ month termin@@ ation period so they will actually finish in 20@@ 17 .
&quot; as such , A@@ G@@ L continues to expect the contracts to contribute to ear@@ nings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential ear@@ nings impact on A@@ G@@ L from F@@ Y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong fu@@ tures market out@@ look for wh@@ oles@@ ale electricity prices .
A@@ G@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; antici@@ pation of a termin@@ ation event . &quot;
Al@@ co@@ a said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s ... ability to operate the sm@@ el@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the sm@@ el@@ ter . &quot;
the US company said it entered into a 20@@ -@@ year contract with L@@ o@@ y Y@@ an@@ g in 2010 , which was due to commen@@ ce from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pull@@ ed out of the contract .
analys@@ ts have been w@@ ary of the possible closure of both of the P@@ or@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter in V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia and also the T@@ om@@ ago plant near Ne@@ w@@ cas@@ t@@ le due to the poor econom@@ ics of the industry .
addressing analys@@ ts earlier in the week , A@@ G@@ L &apos;s head of operations , Ste@@ ph@@ en M@@ ik@@ kel@@ sen said P@@ or@@ t@@ land uses around 600 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of power ann@@ ually and T@@ om@@ ago around 9@@ 00 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a gener@@ ator that W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an reality T@@ V sta@@ r , K@@ end@@ all &apos;s on the cover of September &apos;s vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enn@@ er , 20 , model and fourth d@@ au@@ ghter of mo@@ ther@@ -@@ manag@@ er K@@ ris &apos;s Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ J@@ enn@@ er cl@@ an , is on the cover of US vo@@ gue &apos;s co@@ ve@@ ted September issue .
K@@ end@@ all , who is an E@@ ste@@ e La@@ ud@@ er br@@ and amb@@ assa@@ dor and has w@@ al@@ ked in M@@ il@@ an , Paris and New York fashion weeks , announced the news on her In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room with a bun@@ ch of people I lo@@ ve , looking at this cover made me cr@@ y , &quot; K@@ end@@ all w@@ ro@@ te .
the cover re@@ vel@@ ation was followed by a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( or simply keeping U@@ p with the Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ ans@@ -@@ es@@ que ? ) , sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted reality v@@ ide@@ o that fe@@ a@@ tu@@ red the entire Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ J@@ enn@@ er family ( b@@ ar tro@@ ub@@ lem@@ ak@@ ers Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ y@@ n , and joined by everyone &apos;s fav@@ our@@ ite s@@ ho@@ w@@ bi@@ z unc@@ le , keeping U@@ p producer R@@ y@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) for@@ getting about their sis@@ ter &apos;s cover , only to end with the classi@@ c tw@@ ist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it &apos;s the cl@@ ic@@ he plo@@ t line of nearly every &quot; bir@@ th@@ day &quot; ep@@ is@@ ode of a children &apos;s television show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest deli@@ vers the line , &quot; Y@@ ou thought we for@@ got about you ? , &quot; with the sincer@@ ity of a car@@ to@@ on ra@@ b@@ bit in an 8@@ am ti@@ mes@@ lot ) , but K@@ ris had to get her other girls in on this public@@ ity some@@ how .
because , with a spo@@ t on vo@@ gue &apos;s September issue , we have surely entered a new era of Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sis@@ ter Ki@@ m may have be@@ a@@ ten her to the cover of vo@@ gue ( she shared it with h@@ us@@ b@@ and K@@ an@@ y@@ e West in April 20@@ 14 ) , but the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine &apos;s September cover is a le@@ ag@@ ue un@@ to itself .
the September issue is vo@@ gue &apos;s highest sell@@ ing ed@@ ition of the year .
with a th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness more closely res@@ emb@@ ling a co@@ ff@@ ee table book than a fashion ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , the issue attrac@@ ts a huge number of adver@@ tis@@ ers ( F@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ is@@ ta coun@@ ted 6@@ 15 of last year &apos;s 8@@ 3@@ 2@@ -@@ page tom@@ e as advertising content ) .
the re@@ vel@@ ation of its cover sta@@ r is so ho@@ tly antici@@ pated that , in the past two years , pic@@ tures of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine have been le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announ@@ cement .
previous women to feature on the cover include Na@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bel@@ l , L@@ ind@@ a E@@ van@@ g@@ el@@ is@@ ta and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , the cover has certainly fe@@ a@@ tu@@ red more &quot; cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities who model &quot; than &quot; models who are cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities . &quot;
O@@ sc@@ ar w@@ inner and Di@@ or amb@@ assa@@ dor J@@ enni@@ f@@ er L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence was fe@@ a@@ tu@@ red in 20@@ 13 , the year after L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a had the honour .
but , even on the off@@ -@@ chance that M@@ s J@@ enn@@ er - who is described by the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine as the &quot; break@@ out model &quot; of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pre@@ tty good company .
these cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities are not rela@@ tives of famous people , or reality star@@ s , or kid@@ s these days who know how to make a good S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at v@@ ide@@ o ( although J@@ enn@@ er is all of these things ) .
they are legitim@@ ately tal@@ ented women , excell@@ ing in the enter@@ tain@@ ment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strong@@ est years of her career with the release of L@@ em@@ on@@ ade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position within the fashion world was always going to be f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght .
in June , original V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Secre@@ t model Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Se@@ y@@ m@@ our criticised J@@ enn@@ er and her colleague G@@ ig@@ i H@@ ad@@ id , calling them the &quot; b@@ it@@ ches of the moment . &quot;
this s@@ enti@@ ment has bo@@ iled up again with the news of J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s vo@@ gue cover appearance .
but d@@ w@@ elling on the dis@@ content seems bes@@ ide the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enn@@ er is on the cover of the September issue of vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model , in the pu@@ rest sense of the word .
she &apos;s w@@ al@@ king for Mar@@ c J@@ ac@@ ob@@ s .
she &apos;s sell@@ ing you E@@ ste@@ e La@@ ud@@ er foundation .
she , and all of her sis@@ ters , are sell@@ ing you pic@@ tures of themselves on their respective pay@@ w@@ all@@ ed app@@ s .
she &apos;s sell@@ ing pic@@ tures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ ra@@ w@@ for@@ d &apos;s d@@ au@@ ghter she p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed to lo@@ ve ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
and , in her down@@ time , possibly just as a way still to see sis@@ ter K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her kid@@ s , she &apos;s on reality television .
Community legal centres turn away 16@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 people a year
more than 16@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector b@@ rac@@ ing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on al@@ read@@ y@@ -@@ stre@@ t@@ ched operations .
in Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mos@@ tly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
Community legal services , already stre@@ t@@ ched beyond limits , are b@@ rac@@ ing for further cuts .
from June next year , those legal centres are s@@ lated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
Direc@@ tor of Community Legal C@@ ent@@ res Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land J@@ ames F@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l said the latest National Association of Community Legal C@@ ent@@ res cen@@ su@@ s Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
Mr F@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l said without a re@@ vers@@ al of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community legal centres are ch@@ ron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with un@@ manag@@ eable and cri@@ p@@ pling deb@@ ts , families going through separation , workers who are un@@ fairly sa@@ cked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;@@ re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 20@@ 17 , which means thousands more vulnerable Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ lan@@ ders will be forced to na@@ vig@@ ate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y@@ -@@ General , and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land Sen@@ ator George B@@ ran@@ d@@ is to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;@@ re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their c@@ li@@ ent communities , and for the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ z@@ u@@ k government to invest in this important work .
D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p campaign su@@ ed after sta@@ ff@@ er alleg@@ edly pull@@ ed a gun
new York : D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign was su@@ ed for alleg@@ edly doing nothing after being told that the direc@@ tor of its North Car@@ ol@@ ina operations pull@@ ed a gun on a sta@@ ff@@ er as they dro@@ ve in a Je@@ ep in February .
the incident was described in a law@@ su@@ it f@@ iled on Wednesday in state court in Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te by V@@ inc@@ ent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software train@@ er for the state campaign .
B@@ ordin@@ i said he wa@@ ited for months for the situation to be handled intern@@ ally before realis@@ ing &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the direc@@ tor , E@@ ar@@ l P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p , &quot; produced a p@@ is@@ to@@ l , put his right inde@@ x fin@@ ger on the tri@@ gg@@ er , and dro@@ ve the bar@@ re@@ l into V@@ inc@@ ent &apos;s k@@ ne@@ e ca@@ p , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the complaint .
after compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p , according to the fil@@ ing .
&quot; g@@ un@@ s don &apos;@@ t have to fire to inf@@ lic@@ t damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the complaint .
the su@@ it comes just two days after the Re@@ public@@ an presidential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e caused a f@@ uro@@ re when telling a cro@@ w@@ d in North Car@@ ol@@ ina that the &quot; Sec@@ ond Amendment people &quot; -@@ - understood to be gun owners and gun enthusias@@ ts -@@ - could take action if his ri@@ val H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton were elected and gets her pick of jud@@ ges .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was@@ n &apos;@@ t advoc@@ ating violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for neg@@ li@@ g@@ ent supervision , and from P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p for assa@@ ult , b@@ at@@ ter@@ y and inf@@ lic@@ tion of emo@@ tional dist@@ ress .
tr@@ um@@ p spo@@ kes@@ woman H@@ ope H@@ ic@@ ks d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p were un@@ successful .
W@@ C@@ C@@ B , a local news aff@@ ili@@ ate in Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , reported P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consul@@ ting firm , In@@ no@@ va@@ tive consul@@ ting Ser@@ vic@@ es , was@@ n &apos;@@ t immediately returned .

Britain must chan@@ nel the Olymp@@ ic spirit and exp@@ and He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will also deliver reg@@ ener@@ ation and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attrac@@ tion of He@@ a@@ throw , just as it was with London 20@@ 12 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions bene@@ fi@@ ted from the G@@ ames .
the Olymp@@ ics achieved huge benefits for S@@ tra@@ t@@ for@@ d and the East En@@ d .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities alone we &apos;@@ l@@ l create 10@@ ,@@ 000 new ap@@ pr@@ en@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of London 20@@ 12 , there will be those that think the challenge of He@@ a@@ throw expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the G@@ ames and that we would be embar@@ rass@@ ed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong on 20@@ 12 and they will be proved wrong on He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw is answ@@ ering every question asked of it .
like the Olymp@@ ics , He@@ a@@ throw is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11@@ b@@ n in economic growth , leaving a leg@@ acy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw who have implemented an £ 11@@ b@@ n programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T@@ 5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport termin@@ al five years in a row , to T@@ 2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s bu@@ si@@ est two run@@ ways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third run@@ way , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the London 20@@ 12 G@@ ames were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw expansion will be too .
it is time for us to chan@@ nel that Olymp@@ ic spirit and exp@@ and He@@ a@@ throw , securing our trading future and creating a leg@@ acy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of .

Ad@@ block P@@ lu@@ s , F@@ ace@@ book in &quot; cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ m@@ ouse game &quot; over ad bloc@@ king
for companies that make money from on@@ line advertising , attempts to circum@@ v@@ ent ad@@ -@@ bloc@@ king software amount to a &quot; cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ m@@ ouse game , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on Thursday , just two days after F@@ ace@@ book announced it would be bloc@@ king ad B@@ loc@@ kers on its des@@ k@@ top site , Ad@@ block P@@ lu@@ s published a blo@@ g post saying that users could update their fil@@ ters in its pro@@ gra@@ m to block ads on the social network once again .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ ace@@ book said that its des@@ k@@ top web@@ site would change the cod@@ ing around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad B@@ loc@@ kers to detec@@ t which parts of a page are ads .
but Ad@@ block now says it has g@@ ot@@ ten around the new cod@@ es .
in a blo@@ g post , Ad@@ block spo@@ kes@@ person B@@ en W@@ illi@@ ams w@@ ro@@ te that &quot; this sort of back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ forth battle between the open source ad@@ -@@ bloc@@ king community and circum@@ ven@@ ters has been going on since ad bloc@@ king was inven@@ ted , &quot; and that it is possible F@@ ace@@ book would come up with its own fi@@ x soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad B@@ loc@@ kers have become for the industry .
glob@@ ally , rou@@ gh@@ ly 200 million people use ad B@@ loc@@ kers , according to a study last year from P@@ ag@@ e@@ fair and A@@ do@@ be ; nearly qu@@ ad@@ rup@@ le the number who used such software in 20@@ 13 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users acc@@ essing F@@ ace@@ book via mobile dev@@ ices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of F@@ ace@@ book &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad B@@ loc@@ kers on des@@ k@@ top however , because mobile ad B@@ loc@@ kers are not effective in F@@ ace@@ book &apos;s mobile app@@ s for the social network and In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m , a spo@@ kes@@ person said .
D@@ es@@ k@@ top ads still account for enough revenue that F@@ ace@@ book jud@@ ged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ ace@@ book said it would be up@@ dating its &quot; ad prefer@@ ences &quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on Thursday F@@ ace@@ book claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new fil@@ ters were concerning because they would also block some n@@ on@@ -@@ advertising content on the site .
&quot; this is@@ n &apos;@@ t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a F@@ ace@@ book spo@@ kes@@ person said in an e@@ -@@ ma@@ iled statement .
ad B@@ loc@@ kers are a b@@ lun@@ t instrument , which is why we &apos;@@ ve instead focused on building tools like A@@ d P@@ references to put control in people &apos;s hands .
woman run over on Sw@@ is@@ s motor@@ way in apparent suic@@ ide
the victim was lying on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night .
police are appe@@ aling for witn@@ esses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motor@@ way in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suic@@ ide .
the incident happened on the A@@ 1 near Mor@@ ges in the can@@ ton of V@@ au@@ d just after mid@@ night on Thursday .
a woman lay down in the dar@@ k on the road &quot; in a desper@@ ate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , V@@ au@@ d police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill her@@ self , the victim , a Sw@@ is@@ s woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry .
she died at the sc@@ ene .
several of the drivers involved have already been inter@@ viewed but some are still un@@ identified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , law@@ yer G@@ ill@@ es H@@ of@@ s@@ te@@ t@@ ter told Le T@@ ri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecu@@ tor must determine , &quot; said H@@ of@@ s@@ te@@ t@@ ter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person w@@ al@@ king on the motor@@ way in the dar@@ k - it was jud@@ ged that motor@@ ists cannot expect to come across a pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police offic@@ er was acqu@@ it@@ ted of causing death by neg@@ li@@ gence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A@@ 1 near Pa@@ y@@ ner@@ ne one night in August 20@@ 14 .
the 22@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -@@ - who was responding to an emergency call -@@ - was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about Thursday &apos;s incident near Mor@@ ges should call police on 02@@ 1 6@@ 44 83 46 or 02@@ 1 6@@ 44 44 44 .
N@@ A@@ S@@ A climate model : V@@ en@@ us was once hab@@ itable
V@@ en@@ us was likely once hab@@ itable , according to the pro@@ jec@@ tions of a new N@@ A@@ S@@ A climate model .
scientists at N@@ A@@ S@@ A &apos;s G@@ od@@ d@@ ard In@@ stitute for S@@ pace S@@ tu@@ dies developed a model to expl@@ ore V@@ en@@ us &apos; past using tools and al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not V@@ en@@ us , with its ho@@ t , wa@@ ter@@ -@@ less sur@@ face and CO@@ 2@@ -@@ cho@@ cked atmosphere , might have once hos@@ ted E@@ ar@@ th@@ -@@ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that V@@ en@@ us &apos; slow ro@@ tation rate is explained by its th@@ ick atmosphere .
but the latest si@@ mu@@ lation suggests V@@ en@@ us could have bo@@ as@@ ted a th@@ in , E@@ ar@@ th@@ -@@ like atmosphere and still s@@ pu@@ n slowly .
the model also looked at the to@@ po@@ gra@@ phy of early V@@ en@@ us .
the planet likely fe@@ a@@ tu@@ red more d@@ ry regions than E@@ ar@@ th , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and guard against rapid eva@@ por@@ ation .
early V@@ en@@ us also bene@@ fi@@ ted from a su@@ n that was 30 perc@@ ent d@@ im@@ mer .
&quot; in the G@@ IS@@ S model &apos;s si@@ mu@@ lation , V@@ en@@ us &apos; slow sp@@ in ex@@ poses its da@@ y@@ side to the su@@ n for almost two months at a time , &quot; G@@ IS@@ S sci@@ ent@@ ist An@@ th@@ ony D@@ el Gen@@ io explained in a news release .
this war@@ ms the sur@@ face and produc@@ es ra@@ in that creates a th@@ ick la@@ yer of cl@@ ou@@ ds , which acts like an um@@ bre@@ lla to shi@@ el@@ d the sur@@ face from much of the sol@@ ar he@@ ating .
the result is mean climate tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures that are actually a few degre@@ es co@@ ol@@ er than E@@ ar@@ th &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of V@@ en@@ us similar to the ev@@ olution previously hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ z@@ ed by plan@@ e@@ tary scientists .
though likely once hab@@ itable , V@@ en@@ us was -@@ - over the course of several billion years -@@ - exposed to too much he@@ at and ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et light .
its oc@@ e@@ ans eva@@ por@@ ated and its water va@@ p@@ or was bur@@ ned away by ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et light .
as its hy@@ dro@@ gen escap@@ ed , all that was left was a th@@ ick atmosphere of car@@ bon dio@@ x@@ ide with a dea@@ thly greenhouse gas effect -@@ - thus , the V@@ en@@ us we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new V@@ en@@ us climate model in the jour@@ nal G@@ e@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cal Research L@@ et@@ ters .

Pat@@ ric@@ k Ro@@ y res@@ ig@@ ned as co@@ ach and vice president of the ho@@ c@@ key operations of the Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o a@@ val@@ an@@ ch@@ e on Thursday , c@@ iting a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decisi@@ on@@ -@@ making process .
Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o executive vice president / general manag@@ er J@@ o@@ e Sa@@ ki@@ c confirmed the move and noted that the clu@@ b will begin a search for a new co@@ ach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head co@@ ach and vice president of ho@@ c@@ key operations for the Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o a@@ val@@ an@@ ch@@ e with energy , pas@@ sion and determination , &quot; the 5@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Ro@@ y said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the co@@ ach and V@@ P@@ -@@ ho@@ c@@ key operations needs to be perfectly al@@ ig@@ ned with that of the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sa@@ ki@@ c , who hi@@ red Ro@@ y on May 23 , 20@@ 13 , than@@ ked Ro@@ y for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Pat@@ ric@@ k informed me of his decision today , &quot; Sa@@ ki@@ c said .
we appreciate all he has done for our Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation and wish him the best of lu@@ ck in the future .
Ro@@ y was na@@ med the J@@ ac@@ k Ad@@ ams A@@ ward w@@ inner as the le@@ ag@@ ue &apos;s best co@@ ach during his ro@@ o@@ ki@@ e se@@ as@@ on with the a@@ val@@ an@@ ch@@ e in 20@@ 13@@ -@@ 14 .
he guided the clu@@ b to 1@@ 12 points and a fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ place finish in the Central D@@ iv@@ ision , but Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o was up@@ set by M@@ inn@@ es@@ o@@ ta in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs and has missed the pos@@ t@@ se@@ as@@ on in each of the last two years .
the a@@ val@@ an@@ ch@@ e pos@@ ted a 3@@ 9@@ -@@ 3@@ 9@@ -@@ 4 mark in 20@@ 15@@ -@@ 16 and fel@@ l five points sh@@ y of the W@@ il@@ d for the second w@@ il@@ d@@ -@@ card spo@@ t in the Western Conference .

North Sea oil workers resu@@ me talks , suspen@@ d strike
L@@ ab@@ or strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against o@@ il@@ field services company W@@ ood Group have been sta@@ ged s@@ por@@ ad@@ ically on plat@@ forms in the North Sea oper@@ ated by Ro@@ y@@ al Dutch S@@ hel@@ l .
&quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ M@@ T unions can confirm we have agreed to res@@ tar@@ t the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of fu@@ ll@@ -@@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the lab@@ or unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 perc@@ ent .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contrac@@ tors by about 9 perc@@ ent because of negative market pres@@ su@@ res .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 perc@@ ent decreas@@ e for on@@ shor@@ e contrac@@ tors in 20@@ 14 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market down@@ turn .

energy companies are under pressure from lower cr@@ ude oil prices , an economic situation comp@@ ounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scot@@ t@@ ish Member of Parliament Da@@ ve Ander@@ son met with lab@@ or leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest lab@@ or disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
the North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.@@ 4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 20@@ 16 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er measures sp@@ in rates of star@@ s in P@@ le@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter
the latest mission by the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope has helped as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ers collec@@ t the most complete ca@@ talo@@ g of sp@@ in rates among the star@@ s of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter .
the new data is helping as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ers understand why star@@ s in the cl@@ us@@ ter sp@@ in at var@@ ying rates , as well as how ro@@ tation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by compar@@ ing our results to other sta@@ r cl@@ us@@ ters , we will learn more about the relationship between a sta@@ r &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its sol@@ ar system , &quot; Lu@@ is@@ a Re@@ bul@@ l , a research sci@@ ent@@ ist at C@@ al@@ te@@ ch &apos;s inf@@ r@@ ared Pro@@ c@@ essing and An@@ al@@ y@@ sis C@@ enter in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a news release .
the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter is sit@@ u@@ ated 4@@ 45 li@@ ght@@ -@@ years from E@@ ar@@ th .
many of the star@@ s in the cl@@ us@@ ter are just now reaching ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood , having been born rou@@ gh@@ ly 1@@ 25 million years ago .
they &apos;@@ re sp@@ inning as fast as they ever will .
at their pe@@ a@@ k sp@@ in rates , these ma@@ turing star@@ s e@@ ject large amounts of s@@ tell@@ ar win@@ d .
as these win@@ ds travel across the star@@ s &apos; mag@@ ne@@ tic fields , they en@@ act a bra@@ king effect on the star@@ s .
as a sta@@ r ages , its sp@@ in rate beg@@ ins to slow down .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er measures each sta@@ r &apos;s sp@@ in rate by trac@@ king the time between the appearance of rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ able star@@ spo@@ ts -@@ - like sun@@ spo@@ ts .
the latest ca@@ talo@@ g of sp@@ in rates suggests more massive star@@ s sp@@ in more slowly than less massive star@@ s .
Re@@ bul@@ l lik@@ ens the star@@ s to d@@ an@@ c@@ ers , larger ones pi@@ rou@@ etting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ball@@ et &apos; of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades , we see that slow ro@@ ta@@ tors tend to be more massive , whereas the fas@@ test ro@@ ta@@ tors tend to be very light star@@ s , &quot; said Re@@ bul@@ l .
because the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mic labor@@ atory to compar@@ e s@@ tell@@ ar qualities with sp@@ in rates .
&quot; the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades sta@@ r cl@@ us@@ ter provides an an@@ ch@@ or for the@@ ore@@ tical models of s@@ tell@@ ar ro@@ tation going both direc@@ tions , youn@@ ger and older , &quot; said Re@@ bul@@ l .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why star@@ s slow their sp@@ in rates and han@@ g up their &apos; d@@ ance sho@@ es , &apos; so to speak .
Re@@ bul@@ l and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of P@@ le@@ i@@ ades sp@@ in rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ical J@@ our@@ nal .
