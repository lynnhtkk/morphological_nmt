Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er wanted to change her gender , was diag@@ nos@@ ed with a mental ill@@ ness and is now making art on the theme - &quot; People should have the right to their own body &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of pati@@ ent reports are han@@ ging from the ceiling of the Pro@@ ject Ro@@ om gall@@ ery of the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts .
the name of Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er is written on every one of them .
the reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of A@@ u@@ er and her identity -
decided on who she is on her behalf .
&quot; I wanted to disc@@ lose my personal medical history to highlight the violence of the whole process , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
here , &quot; process &quot; refers to her sex reas@@ sign@@ ment procedure .
it is a man@@ y@@ -@@ year examination period , including meetings with psych@@ olog@@ ists , p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ ts , nur@@ ses and physi@@ ci@@ ans .
the process star@@ ts with a refer@@ ral to diag@@ n@@ ose a gender identity dis@@ order . these diag@@ nos@@ es are perfor@@ med in Tampere and Helsinki .
A@@ u@@ er &apos;s process started four years ago .
before this , she had already been using o@@ es@@ tro@@ gen or@@ dered from the inter@@ net and was also otherwise far in her own reas@@ sign@@ ment procedure .
even though she felt like a woman , Finnish legislation states that an individual must under@@ go a reas@@ sign@@ ment procedure before the gender can also be al@@ tered legally .
the Act on the Legal Rec@@ og@@ n@@ ition of the Gen@@ der of Trans@@ sex@@ u@@ als ( 5@@ 63 / 2002 ) , or the trans act , obli@@ gates trans@@ gender people to a compulsory ster@@ il@@ isation so that their correct gender can be registered , for example , in the P@@ op@@ u@@ lation Re@@ g@@ is@@ ter Centre and their pass@@ port .
currently , each person about to change their gender is required to have a p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric diag@@ no@@ sis and a certi@@ fic@@ ate of their in@@ ability to re@@ produce .
people should have the right to decide on their own body .
&quot; this situation is intolerable and in violation of human rights , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
amendments to the Finnish trans act have been on the table for long .
the UN Human Rights Council has issued eight concerns regarding the act , and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obli@@ gates parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to adhere to the right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination .
the former Government of Finland prepared the amendments to the act under S@@ us@@ an@@ ne Hu@@ ov@@ inen , the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health .
after the following elections , the F@@ inn@@ s Party received seats in the Government .
now , the amendments are again at a stand@@ still
due to internal dis@@ agreements that are not even related to this particular act .
&quot; the Government is not willing to han@@ dle the act , as there are dis@@ agreements over the amendments within the Government , &quot; says Fran@@ k J@@ oh@@ ans@@ son , direc@@ tor of Amnesty Finland .
the front of the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition area is domin@@ ated by two large installations .
one of these is made of the packa@@ ges and instruc@@ tions of medicinal products used by A@@ u@@ er .
any vis@@ itor to the pati@@ ent record install@@ ation can read , for example , the interpretation a psych@@ olog@@ ist working in the trans@@ gender depart@@ ment of Tampere Uni@@ versity H@@ os@@ pi@@ tal has made of A@@ u@@ er .
the psych@@ olog@@ ist met Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er two times and , on the basis of these meetings , wrote a report that would define A@@ u@@ er &apos;s rights to receive treatment and assistance .
the pati@@ ent &apos;s sense of reality is reported to be close to sha@@ king .
the pati@@ ent &apos;s concep@@ tion of her@@ self seems to be dis@@ organised as a bor@@ der@@ line case and the un@@ stable features of her person@@ ality are emphasised .
A@@ u@@ er does not recognise her@@ self from these reports .
&quot; it was shoc@@ king to hear that I was diag@@ nos@@ ed as men@@ tally ill , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
what was even more shoc@@ king was that A@@ u@@ er was not given access to gender reas@@ sign@@ ment sur@@ ger@@ y .
according to the nur@@ sing staff , she did not have sufficient resources to start the process .
her own identity was denied from her .
on that day on 11 February 20@@ 15 , A@@ u@@ er wal@@ ked out of the meeting and s@@ mas@@ hed a TV in the waiting room of the trans@@ gender depart@@ ment .
later , that TV evol@@ ved into a mon@@ u@@ ment for the excluded , a work of art through which A@@ u@@ er reflects on her experiences in power and how it is exerc@@ ised .
&quot; it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their b@@ reas@@ ts enlarged . but , to have b@@ reas@@ ts removed altogether , a diag@@ no@@ sis is needed , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
you do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at birth .
unfortunately , A@@ u@@ er &apos;s experience is not unique .
for many , a gender reas@@ sign@@ ment process is tou@@ gh@@ er men@@ tally than physi@@ cally as a result of medical operations .
anyone who under@@ goes the process meets do@@ z@@ ens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity .
&quot; it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y that treatment is denied from people who need help and support by saying that they don &apos;@@ t have sufficient resources , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
many applying for the process have suffered from mental dis@@ orders : de@@ pression , an@@ xi@@ ety and possibly bu@@ ll@@ ying .
by appe@@ aling to these , the nur@@ sing staff can decide that the process cannot be started .
&quot; if people are not given access to treatment and assistance , their situation may even become worse than it was before the process , &quot; says A@@ u@@ er .
A@@ u@@ er &apos;s personal ex@@ hi@@ bit also deals with an@@ xi@@ ety and thoughts of suicide .
in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition bro@@ ch@@ ure , A@@ u@@ er w@@ ri@@ tes : &quot; I &apos;@@ ve had su@@ ic@@ id@@ al thoughts throughout my ad@@ ult life , and this is something people find hard to accept . &quot;
A@@ u@@ er has received medicine for her de@@ pression . when she started to take hor@@ mon@@ es , she also started to feel better .
she was finally able to put into words the feelings she had had since her chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and te@@ en@@ age -
why her wide ch@@ in did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pec@@ tor@@ al mus@@ cles were round instead of fl@@ at .
A@@ u@@ er has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her .
being seen is a basic need .
&quot; I need to explain my existence through my words , c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , voice and motions , &quot; she says .
currently , A@@ u@@ er feels that she is seen , and exists as a woman .
however , in the first phas@@ es of the process , ran@@ dom comments by people close to her hur@@ t .
what hur@@ ts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrec@@ tly .
&quot; they should know who I am , and they do know it , but they refuse to accept it or can &apos;@@ t accept it , &quot; she continues .
however , not all trans@@ gender people want physical al@@ te@@ rations .
they do not suffer from the body d@@ ys@@ mor@@ phic dis@@ order , whereby their body or its parts can cause an@@ xi@@ ety or even physical pain .
without the use of hor@@ mon@@ es or a lengthy examination process , it is not possible to have an official status for one &apos;s own gender .
&quot; there is no medical basis for these examin@@ ations , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
this is true .
for example , in Denmark , Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 20@@ 14 .
the new legislation is based on the right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination when it comes to the legal gender .
an ad@@ ult applicant needs to f@@ ile a written application for a new personal identity code , indic@@ ating that they feel like they represent the other gender .
after a re@@ consideration period of six months , the applicant needs to confirm their application in writing , after which the minis@@ try will provide the applicant with a new personal identity code .
a similar right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination is also demanded in Finland , and this is also what character@@ ises A@@ u@@ er &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition .
the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition has not been any therapeutic experience for the artis@@ t ; it is a political and artis@@ tic collection .
&quot; I want to believe that art still matters and it helps to achieve political changes , during a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights . &quot;
Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition An@@ ti@@ p@@ hall@@ ic D@@ ick at the Pro@@ ject Ro@@ om of the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts on 4@@ -@@ 28 July 20@@ 17 .
civil rights group issues travel warning for M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i
the National Association for the advan@@ cement of C@@ olo@@ red People has put out an al@@ ert for people of col@@ or tra@@ vel@@ ing to M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i because of the state &apos;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
&quot; the N@@ A@@ ACP Tra@@ vel Ad@@ visory for the state of M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i , effective through August 2@@ 8@@ th , 20@@ 17 , calls for African American tra@@ vel@@ ers , vis@@ itors and M@@ is@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when tra@@ vel@@ ing throughout the state given the series of question@@ able , rac@@ e@@ -@@ based incidents occurr@@ ing sta@@ te@@ wide recently , and noted there@@ in , &quot; the group &apos;s statement read@@ s .
a recent M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i law making it har@@ der for people to win discrimination law@@ su@@ its , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement dis@@ proportion@@ ately tar@@ geting minorities promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel al@@ ert , the N@@ A@@ ACP said .
&quot; you have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .
they &apos;@@ re being pu@@ lled over because of their s@@ kin col@@ or , they &apos;@@ re being be@@ a@@ ten up or killed , &quot; the president of the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i N@@ A@@ ACP , R@@ od Cha@@ pe@@ l , told The K@@ an@@ sa@@ s C@@ ity Sta@@ r .
&quot; we are hearing complaints at a rate we ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t heard before . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has issued for a state in the US .
the group ci@@ ted incidents such as ra@@ cial s@@ l@@ ur@@ s against black students at the Uni@@ versity of M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory Sanders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
Sanders died under question@@ able circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while tra@@ vel@@ ing through the state , and was taken into cus@@ tod@@ y by M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the advisory also points to a recent report by the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i A@@ tt@@ or@@ ney General &apos;s Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 per@@ cent more likely to be pu@@ lled over than wh@@ i@@ tes .
&quot; the advisory is for people to be aware , and warn their families and friends and co@@ -@@ workers of what could happen in M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i , &quot; Cha@@ pe@@ l said .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it &apos;s bringing b@@ ai@@ l money with them , or let@@ ting rela@@ tives know they are tra@@ vel@@ ing through the state . &quot;
M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i recorded 100 ha@@ te crimes in 20@@ 15 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I &apos;s ha@@ te crime reporting progra@@ m , ran@@ king the state at 1@@ 6@@ th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
the travel warning is also a response to a new M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a business for hous@@ ing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel advis@@ or@@ ies for T@@ ex@@ as and A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to de@@ tain people on immigration violations which the AC@@ L@@ U said would increase ra@@ cial prof@@ iling .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State De@@ part@@ ment for other countries , but la@@ tely , advoc@@ acy groups have resor@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US .
Y@@ le : L@@ in@@ til@@ ä asked Fin@@ na@@ ir to clarify the C@@ E@@ O &apos;s additional pension
Y@@ le reports that M@@ ika L@@ in@@ til@@ ä ( Centre Party ) , Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of Government ownership ste@@ ering , has asked Fin@@ na@@ ir to clarify the additional pension paid to C@@ E@@ O P@@ e@@ k@@ ka V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o .
according to L@@ in@@ til@@ ä , this is in conflict with the Government &apos;s definitions .
V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o &apos;s additional pension of EUR 13@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 hit the news this week when Hel@@ sing@@ in San@@ om@@ at reported on the development on incentives paid to direc@@ tors of listed companies .
Su@@ om@@ en Ku@@ val@@ eh@@ ti reported on V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o &apos;s additional pension in February .
Fin@@ na@@ ir announced its intention to dis@@ continue additional pensions in 20@@ 13 .
the Government has defined that no additional pensions should be used as incentives .
the state holds more than half of Fin@@ na@@ ir .
according to the company , this decision is in line with last year &apos;s decisi@@ on@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ principle on ownership ste@@ ering .
sanctions immediately resulted in he@@ ated talks
some time ago , it still seemed that U@@ S@@ -@@ Russia relations were turning from cold to ho@@ t .
when meeting at the G@@ 20 summit in H@@ am@@ burg , D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp , the President of the USA , and V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir Putin , the President of Russia , seemed to get along nic@@ ely .
later on , the relationship has become notably col@@ der .
Russia showed a b@@ itte@@ r response to the new economic sanctions approved last week by the US Congress and signed by tru@@ mp on Wednesday .
so far , the most s@@ tunn@@ ing response has been heard from Prime Minister D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v who said that the sanctions bill signed by tru@@ mp will result in a &quot; fu@@ ll@@ -@@ scale trade war . &quot;
even if the Russian responses were sh@@ ru@@ g@@ ged off merely as ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations and ag@@ gra@@ va@@ tions belonging to political rhetoric , the increased tension between the USA and Russia is a fact , following the short h@@ one@@ y@@ mo@@ on after tru@@ mp &apos;s election .
in the USA , passing the sanctions act concerning Russia , Iran and North Korea was no simple process .
then again , the US Congress was remar@@ ka@@ bly unanimous in passing the bill . however , it was told that accepting the bill was much more difficult for the president .
soon after signing the bill , tru@@ mp criticised it as being &quot; significantly in@@ complete . &quot;
the su@@ l@@ kin@@ ess of President tru@@ mp was probably caused by Russia , even though it must have also felt dis@@ agre@@ eable to sign a bill that limits the president &apos;s own power .
as is widely known , the USA is investig@@ ating Russia &apos;s possible involvement in the presidential election and any links between tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign and Russia .
after a short h@@ one@@ y@@ mo@@ on , the relationship between the USA and Russia has turned decid@@ edly col@@ der .
as the tur@@ no@@ ver of White House staff has been high and different scand@@ alous tw@@ ists and turns have been revealed nearly every day , it seems to be more apparent that US foreign policy is not run by the president , but regardless of the president .
such a situation is in no sense a prefer@@ able one .
if the Russian relations are a tric@@ ky business in the USA , the same goes with the European Union .
in addition to economic sanctions , the intensi@@ fied security situation in the Baltic Sea region tigh@@ tens the relationship .
the EU has visi@@ bly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relationship with Russia and demanded the execution of the M@@ ins@@ k Protocol .
even though the EU has remained unified , at least visi@@ bly , in its Russian policy , its member states have fairly differing interests .
for a member state such as Finland that tra@@ des frequently with Russia , economic sanctions are a constant nu@@ is@@ ance .
the impact of the new US sanctions act remains unclear .
the EU has fe@@ ared that sanctions will make the life of many European companies difficult .
in Finland , the act may have an impact , for example , on the Nor@@ d S@@ tre@@ am 2 gas pi@@ p@@ eline project and the F@@ en@@ no@@ vo@@ im@@ a nuclear power plant project .
another cause of s@@ our@@ ness in Europe is that li@@ qu@@ e@@ fied natural gas , which is important for US finances , has been excluded from the sanctions .
trade sanctions are a global way of showing dis@@ approval .
however , economic sanctions must be w@@ ell@@ -@@ considered and accurate ,
or they become harmful rather than useful .
is nothing sa@@ c@@ red ?
now tru@@ mp &apos;s White House is tar@@ geting the Sta@@ tue of Liber@@ ty
the su@@ rest mark of regime change is when they start atta@@ cking the sta@@ tu@@ es .
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully sta@@ ge@@ -@@ man@@ ged top@@ pl@@ ing of Saddam Hussein in Fir@@ do@@ s squ@@ are in Bag@@ hd@@ ad in 2003 .
Ste@@ ph@@ en Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gu@@ es of the tru@@ mp regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic a@@ x@@ e to the Sta@@ tue of Liber@@ ty in a he@@ ated argument with C@@ N@@ N &apos;s J@@ i@@ m Ac@@ os@@ ta over the president &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically limit legal immigration .
in fair@@ ness , Mill@@ er did not attack the sta@@ tue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ -@@ tri@@ p owners and Liber@@ ty im@@ person@@ ators would have l@@ y@@ n@@ ched him if he did .
but he did attack its meaning , and in particular the meaning as@@ cri@@ bed to it when E@@ mm@@ a La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s famous po@@ e@@ m was added to its base in 19@@ 03 , 17 years after the mon@@ u@@ ment itself was completed .
as Mill@@ er sc@@ ol@@ ded Ac@@ os@@ ta : &quot; I don &apos;@@ t want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the Sta@@ tue of Liber@@ ty is ... a sym@@ bo@@ l of American liber@@ ty li@@ ghting the world .
the po@@ e@@ m that you &apos;@@ re referring to , that was added later and is not part of the original Sta@@ tue of Liber@@ ty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is fac@@ tually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .
it is about the con@@ temporary res@@ on@@ ance of La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s star@@ t@@ ling words , the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your ti@@ red , your poor , / Y@@ our hu@@ d@@ d@@ led m@@ asses ye@@ ar@@ ning to brea@@ the free , / The w@@ re@@ t@@ ched refuse of your te@@ em@@ ing shor@@ e . &quot;
there has never been a time when the &quot; w@@ re@@ t@@ ched refuse &quot; has been more visible on our scre@@ ens .
Mill@@ er was not eng@@ aging in li@@ ter@@ ary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in tru@@ mp &apos;s USA .
this conflict about the meaning of a sta@@ tue is part of a wider political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the meaning of America .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us - and her friends who campaig@@ ned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were eng@@ aging in a highly political act .
the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was intended to mark the connec@@ tions between French and American re@@ public@@ an@@ ism by representing in a w@@ ell@@ -@@ wor@@ n classi@@ cal tro@@ pe , the female em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of Liber@@ ty .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us changed that meaning : in her po@@ e@@ m the female figure is no longer ab@@ stra@@ ct - she has a voice .
and she gives her@@ self a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ es .
the mar@@ r@@ ying of the po@@ e@@ m to the image is a bri@@ lli@@ ant f@@ em@@ inis@@ t cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American na@@ ti@@ vis@@ m .
and just as La@@ z@@ ar@@ us changed the meaning of the sta@@ tue , ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ing@@ ers have long wanted to change it back .
the great lou@@ d@@ mouth Rus@@ h L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh , a kind of J@@ oh@@ n the B@@ ap@@ tis@@ t for the coming of tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that Liber@@ ty is not inv@@ iting anyone in , but is rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , taking the American fla@@ me out to the ben@@ i@@ ghted world : &quot; la@@ dy Liber@@ ty is ste@@ pping forward .
she is meant to be carrying the tor@@ ch of liber@@ ty from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to light the way to the United States . &quot;
rather un@@ usually , L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh actually hit on something .
the meaning of the sta@@ tue is entirely a matter of the ang@@ le of perc@@ eption .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s great imag@@ in@@ ative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhaus@@ ted , w@@ re@@ t@@ ched but hope@@ ful people on the dec@@ ks of ships after long and often d@@ read@@ ful jour@@ ne@@ ys .
it is li@@ terally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refu@@ ge and a chance to better their lives .
her sta@@ tue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective Mill@@ er and tru@@ mp want ever to recognise .
their tor@@ ch is meant not to light the way , but to inf@@ la@@ me the ha@@ tre@@ ds that are their only source of power .
world Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships 20@@ 17 : N@@ ei@@ l B@@ lack pra@@ ises Scot@@ t@@ ish members of T@@ e@@ am G@@ B
E@@ il@@ id@@ h Do@@ y@@ le rec@@ all@@ s a time when only two S@@ co@@ ts made the G@@ B team
UK Ath@@ le@@ tics &apos; performance direc@@ tor N@@ ei@@ l B@@ lack says the 1@@ 6@@ -@@ strong Scot@@ t@@ ish con@@ t@@ ing@@ ent in the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships squ@@ ad will make &quot; a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scot@@ t@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have been selec@@ ted for London 20@@ 17 , which star@@ ts on Friday .
black believes &quot; there &apos;s something special evol@@ ving &quot; in Scotland and UK a@@ th@@ le@@ tics must learn from that .
&quot; we emb@@ race it and we &apos;@@ re trying to understand it and we &apos;@@ ll push on that until we work it out , &quot; B@@ lack said .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scot@@ t@@ ish Institu@@ te of Sport and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
Scot@@ t@@ ish Ath@@ le@@ tics think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
British a@@ th@@ le@@ tics : it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
and the gu@@ y on the cor@@ ner stre@@ et , too .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely bri@@ lli@@ ant . &quot;
several of the Scot@@ t@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are me@@ d@@ al conten@@ ders , including La@@ ur@@ a Mu@@ ir and An@@ drew B@@ ut@@ char@@ t - who will race against S@@ ir M@@ o F@@ ar@@ ah in the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ m , while E@@ il@@ id@@ h Do@@ y@@ le was voted by the squ@@ ad to be team cap@@ tain .
&quot; E@@ il@@ id@@ h is slightly modest .
her cap@@ tain &apos;s speech was incredi@@ ble , &quot; says B@@ lack .
&quot; a number of a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , whether they were Scot@@ t@@ ish or wherever they live or train , wal@@ ked out of that room feeling hu@@ g@@ ely proud and really moti@@ vated .
the pas@@ sion and real feeling that E@@ il@@ id@@ h naturally put into it were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ all@@ ist , who will compete in the 4@@ 00@@ m hur@@ d@@ les at her fifth World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , says it &apos;s &quot; incredi@@ ble &quot; 16 S@@ co@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s previous best total of a@@ th@@ le@@ tes at the wor@@ l@@ ds was seven , achieved in 198@@ 3 and 20@@ 15 .
M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ distance run@@ ner Mu@@ ir is leading the way , having set five British and two European recor@@ ds in the past year .
she will go in the 15@@ 00@@ m and the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ m .
Ch@@ ris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs in the 15@@ 00@@ m , is another S@@ co@@ t to watch , following a great se@@ as@@ on that included victory at the British T@@ e@@ am tri@@ als and the Ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary G@@ ames .
Do@@ y@@ le re@@ members her first world champ@@ ion@@ ships , when the only other S@@ co@@ t in the team was Le@@ e Mc@@ C@@ onn@@ ell .
the team cap@@ tain says she &apos;s &quot; hu@@ g@@ ely proud &quot; of the fact so many of her com@@ patri@@ ots have not only made the team , but , in some cases , will be challeng@@ ing for me@@ d@@ als and compet@@ ing to make fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team cap@@ tain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team , so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes have voted for you and chosen you made it extra@@ -@@ special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I &apos;@@ m very proud of all the S@@ co@@ ts who &apos;@@ ve made the team .
it just shows how far we &apos;@@ ve come .
and they &apos;@@ re here as w@@ ell@@ -@@ established a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , a@@ th@@ le@@ tes that are going to be looking to get on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my cap@@ tain &apos;s speech ?
Y@@ e@@ ah , I think it went well .
I just drew on the fact that we &apos;@@ re very lu@@ ck@@ y in this situation in that we &apos;@@ ve got a home World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships .
so it &apos;s really just the importance of drawing on that home support and th@@ ri@@ ving on the fact that we &apos;@@ re back at the Olympic Sta@@ di@@ um .
I &apos;@@ m getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;s just going to be such an ama@@ z@@ ing atmosphere out there . &quot;
bloc@@ king critic@@ s from F@@ ace@@ book : don &apos;@@ t run for public office , if you can &apos;@@ t take he@@ at from voters
the fa@@ ther of our country knew something about bad press .
Americans lov@@ ed Geor@@ ge Washington , but it d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t take long for newspapers to start sla@@ mm@@ ing him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
he cha@@ f@@ ed at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critic@@ s .
because back in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; the freedom of speech may be taken away - and , du@@ m@@ b &amp; silent we may be led , like sheep , to the slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mar@@ yl@@ and G@@ ov@@ . L@@ ar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work on being more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an &apos;s staff has bloc@@ ked and dele@@ ted the posts of at least 4@@ 50 people who vo@@ ic@@ ed their opinions on his official F@@ ace@@ book page .
and the American C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him for that earlier this week .
the govern@@ or &apos;s staff dis@@ missed the law@@ su@@ it as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the on@@ line com@@ mentary was rich with a &quot; who car@@ es ? &quot; bac@@ kl@@ as@@ h .
&quot; it &apos;s only F@@ ace@@ book , &quot; pl@@ enty of fol@@ ks said .
but it matters .
and it especially matters when it &apos;s a gu@@ y like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Re@@ public@@ an govern@@ or in an overwhel@@ min@@ g@@ ly Democratic state who is aston@@ is@@ h@@ ingly popular .
he has the secon@@ d@@ -@@ highest approval rating of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reac@@ tionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
he &apos;s shown a stead@@ y hand in leading his state and a ster@@ n adher@@ ence to principles .
he &apos;s also been pre@@ tty de@@ ft at using F@@ ace@@ book as a primary means to connec@@ t with his constitu@@ ents , pla@@ y@@ fully deb@@ u@@ ting his ha@@ ir@@ less head after che@@ m@@ o treat@@ ments on his page .
so bloc@@ king people who come to the govern@@ or &apos;s page - which is a public forum , la@@ bel@@ ed as official and ad@@ minis@@ tered by staff members paid public tax doll@@ ars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an inter@@ view with The Washington P@@ ost , H@@ og@@ an spo@@ kes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia C@@ has@@ se defended the govern@@ or &apos;s actions , argu@@ ing that bloc@@ king the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or spa@@ mm@@ ers or ha@@ te@@ ful fol@@ ks las@@ hing out on@@ line .
the P@@ ost talked to some of the real people bloc@@ ked by H@@ og@@ an .
and they &apos;@@ re just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teac@@ her , a business ow@@ ner and a pas@@ tor , not tro@@ lls .

A@@ tt@@ or@@ ney La@@ ks@@ h@@ mi Sar@@ ma R@@ a@@ man@@ i of Bow@@ i@@ e , M@@ d . , was@@ n &apos;@@ t ha@@ te@@ ful , but she asked about ha@@ te crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ i@@ tely commen@@ ted that I was disappointed in his lack of response to ha@@ te crimes and other recent news items , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of The P@@ ost &apos;s news story .
&quot; I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately dis@@ regarded by some as a so@@ -@@ called collective effort , rather than rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed as a large group of concerned citizens . &quot;
what the govern@@ or &apos;s staff called a &quot; concentrated spa@@ m attack &quot; others would probably call &quot; advoc@@ acy . &quot;
the F@@ ace@@ book era makes it easy to ta@@ il@@ or a message by simply bloc@@ king a cr@@ iti@@ c or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot clean@@ er than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collec@@ t and bur@@ n newspapers with critical ed@@ itor@@ i@@ als or arres@@ ting and sil@@ enc@@ ing protes@@ ters .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening , only di@@ gi@@ tally .
H@@ og@@ an is@@ n &apos;@@ t the first public official to be critic@@ iz@@ ed for def@@ ang@@ ing F@@ ace@@ book and other social media .
President tru@@ mp is being su@@ ed by T@@ wit@@ ter users who were bloc@@ ked from his T@@ wit@@ ter feed .
one of the first land@@ mark rul@@ ings on this issue came down last week in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .

this shoul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be so hard .
in Washington &apos;s time , the era of affor@@ dable pos@@ tage had an impact much like the Internet .
the number of newspapers qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ed between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , and an@@ ony@@ m@@ ous letter w@@ ri@@ ters ha@@ mm@@ ered his leadership .
and even back then , Washington had an@@ ony@@ m@@ ous tro@@ lls .
people using the p@@ se@@ ud@@ ony@@ ms &quot; J@@ ur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ er@@ i@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; all wrote letters to newspapers tras@@ hing Washington &apos;s decisions .

freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and disc@@ our@@ se lie at the very foundation of our nation .

summer bir@@ d feeding should be stopped at once
&quot; we have received sa@@ mp@@ les from rou@@ gh@@ ly five loc@@ ations and on@@ line reports from two to three places .

it has been known to infec@@ t d@@ ov@@ es , particularly pi@@ ge@@ ons .
in the 200@@ 0s , the disease was also discovered in fin@@ ches .
the most devastating news was heard in 200@@ 9
when tric@@ hom@@ on@@ i@@ asi@@ s significantly reduced the number of European gre@@ en@@ fin@@ ches in Finland , after which the species has slowly recover@@ ed .
&quot; we have seen evidence of dis@@ e@@ ased European gre@@ en@@ fin@@ ches , but not on a large scale , at least not yet , &quot; says J@@ uh@@ a H@@ on@@ k@@ al@@ a , senior m@@ use@@ um techn@@ ic@@ ian at the Finnish M@@ use@@ um of Na@@ tural H@@ is@@ tory .
&quot; we fear that the previous ep@@ id@@ em@@ ics will rec@@ ur , unless we do something .
what we need to do is very simple : everyone must stop summer bir@@ d feeding at once . &quot;

possible in@@ door climate problems investig@@ ated in S@@ ä@@ ky@@ l@@ ä
the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade has reported that , so far , no in@@ door climate problems have been discovered in the building of the signals company in S@@ ä@@ ky@@ l@@ ä .
investigations are still in progress .
the investigations started after a man had to inter@@ rupt his military service as he sus@@ pected that his state of health deterior@@ ated due to the poor in@@ door climate at the bar@@ rac@@ ks .
according to li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant colon@@ el M@@ ika Hol@@ ma , chi@@ ef of staff of the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade , there have been no problems regarding the health of other con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts .
&quot; it turned out that this was a separate incident , and no other con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts ser@@ ving in the same unit have experienced any problems .
we take every report seriously , and we wanted to thoroughly investigate this case .
currently , we are not aware of any in@@ door climate problem , &quot; Hol@@ ma says .
the press release issued by the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade says that it was necessary to re@@ loc@@ ate some material to the bar@@ rac@@ ks to make room for new con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts in July , which may have increased the volume of d@@ ust tempor@@ arily .
&quot; the air may have felt stu@@ ff@@ y because of this , &quot; Hol@@ ma says .

an existing movement ag@@ ita@@ ting for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which main@@ tains ti@@ ght control over the region , bar@@ ring foreign journalists or rights mon@@ itors .

P@@ a@@ pu@@ a is Indonesia &apos;s poorest prov@@ in@@ ce , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst inf@@ ant mor@@ tality and li@@ te@@ racy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s land of g@@ old .
the world &apos;s largest and most profitable g@@ old mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , ow@@ ned by P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x@@ -@@ based F@@ re@@ e@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , lies just 60 mil@@ es from P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i , a hi@@ gh@@ land prov@@ in@@ ce around the size of New J@@ er@@ se@@ y and home to 15@@ 3@@ ,@@ 000 people .

these ric@@ hes are , however , a source of mis@@ ery for P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans , ensuring Indonesia &apos;s powerful military main@@ tains a su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 investigation in The New York T@@ imes reported that F@@ re@@ e@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 to a single offic@@ er .

the prov@@ in@@ ce &apos;s 3@@ .5 million population is 83 % Christian , but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia &apos;s p@@ op@@ ulous islands of J@@ ava , B@@ or@@ neo , Su@@ ma@@ tra and Su@@ law@@ es@@ i .

&quot; our hear@@ ts have been broken because in 20@@ 14 we voted for J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i , with the expec@@ tation that he would ful@@ fill our hopes for justice to be resto@@ red , &quot; Y@@ ou says .
in fact , P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i suffered a na@@ di@@ r just two months after J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i &apos;s October in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration .
on Dec@@ . 7 , 20@@ 14 a group of 11 children were outside sing@@ ing Christmas car@@ ols in front of a b@@ on@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i when two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motor@@ b@@ ike bro@@ ke through the g@@ loo@@ m .
the star@@ t@@ led children told them that they should turn on their head@@ li@@ ghts .
one of the soldiers took umb@@ ra@@ ge at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local pas@@ tor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ a@@ i .
the soldiers , who had been drinking , ch@@ ased and be@@ at the group with their ri@@ f@@ le bu@@ t@@ ts , said victims and witn@@ esses .
then one of the soldiers fi@@ red into the group of children .
one child , 1@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Y@@ e@@ im@@ o , was be@@ a@@ ten so badly he fel@@ l into a com@@ a .
a couple of hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by government E@@ lec@@ tion Commission building was set ab@@ la@@ ze , and things es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted the following day .
about 1@@ ,@@ 000 young P@@ a@@ pu@@ an men , women and children gather@@ ed on a so@@ cc@@ er field in front of the local police station and military comm@@ and cen@@ ter to demand justice .
they carried cer@@ em@@ on@@ ial hun@@ ting b@@ ow@@ s and perfor@@ med the wa@@ ita d@@ ance - running in cir@@ cles and si@@ mu@@ lating bir@@ d@@ s@@ ong - of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tri@@ be .
some protes@@ ters started hur@@ ling st@@ ones at police and military posts .
as tem@@ pers gre@@ w more he@@ ated , an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio : &quot; if the m@@ asses offer resistance more than three times , sho@@ ot them dead , &quot; it said , according to an official document seen by time that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ e@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ a@@ me , 56 , the head of the K@@ e@@ go Ko@@ to neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of En@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i , saw the im@@ pending danger and appe@@ aled for cal@@ m , im@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the cro@@ w@@ d to go back home .
nobody was in the mo@@ od to listen .
&quot; when I turned around I suddenly got sh@@ ot in my left w@@ ris@@ t , &quot; he told time on the por@@ ch of his bri@@ ghtly pain@@ ted wo@@ o@@ den house .
Ka@@ y@@ a@@ me still do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t know who fi@@ red but says the bu@@ ll@@ et came from the ran@@ ks of am@@ ass@@ ed soldiers .
&quot; it was cro@@ w@@ ded , many sh@@ ots were fi@@ red , &quot; he ad@@ ds .
local man Al@@ fi@@ us Y@@ ou@@ w was hit three times , according to his c@@ ous@@ in who witnessed the sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , &quot; Y@@ o@@ han@@ es , who like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans only goes by one name , told time s@@ om@@ ber@@ ly .
&quot; I saw he was dead ... I k@@ is@@ sed him . &quot;
the P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Pol@@ ice Chi@@ ef In@@ spec@@ tor General Y@@ ot@@ j@@ e Men@@ de told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers were only &quot; securing &quot; their station because it was under attack .
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Pol@@ ice spo@@ kes@@ person , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ y@@ o said in 20@@ 15 .
&quot; it &apos;s a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Wat@@ ch , five young protes@@ ters were killed and many more inju@@ red .
news of the ki@@ ll@@ ings only fil@@ tered through to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta the following day .
three weeks later , J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i gave an imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed speech in J@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ pur@@ a , where he expressed sympa@@ th@@ ies with the victims &apos; families and vo@@ wed to address the historic abuses in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so it won &apos;@@ t ever happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 20@@ 16 that he was setting up a non@@ -@@ judicial mechanism to sett@@ le historic human@@ -@@ rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the violations occurred a long time ago .
some were in the &apos; 9@@ 0s and in early 200@@ 0s .
the point is we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; he said .
then W@@ ir@@ an@@ to back@@ trac@@ ked when speaking to time in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on June 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a gri@@ ev@@ ance mechanism in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a .
instead , &quot; Al@@ l will be settled by law , &quot; he said .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who the U@@ .@@ N@@ . has indic@@ ted for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; relating to more than 1@@ ,@@ 000 deaths during East Tim@@ or &apos;s blo@@ ody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human@@ -@@ rights violations in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a have already been settled , including the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i incident .
families of the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i victims gre@@ e@@ ted such claims with gri@@ m inc@@ red@@ ul@@ ity .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been inter@@ viewed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , &quot; Y@@ o@@ han@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be sh@@ ot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us ec@@ ho@@ ed the view that people in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i are fe@@ ar@@ ful of discussing the incident .
he says he was be@@ a@@ ten by the military after helping to bur@@ y four of the victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t stopped .
on Tuesday , Indones@@ ian police sh@@ ot at vill@@ ag@@ ers in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i &apos;s neigh@@ bor@@ ing D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i reg@@ ency .
one person died and 17 others were w@@ ounded , including children , during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ ag@@ ers and the manag@@ er of a construction company who refused to help transport an un@@ consci@@ ous man to hospi@@ tal .
the man , 2@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w who dro@@ w@@ ned while he was fishing in a ne@@ ar@@ by ri@@ ver , died on the way to hospi@@ tal .
inc@@ ens@@ ed vill@@ ag@@ ers protes@@ ted in front of the company &apos;s site office .
police said the vill@@ ag@@ ers thre@@ w ro@@ cks at officers , who responded by fir@@ ing warning sh@@ ots .
but loc@@ als say the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ am@@ ili@@ tary police ) began sho@@ ot@@ ing at the cro@@ w@@ d , killing one .
&quot; we were so pan@@ ic@@ ked , we are afraid there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old D@@ om@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospi@@ tal and witnessed the inju@@ red being hur@@ ried in , tell@@ s time .
&quot; I have been hid@@ ing in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile bri@@ g@@ ade to be withdrawn from the area .
P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i has always been a tro@@ ub@@ les@@ po@@ t for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , D@@ an@@ i , and Da@@ mal peoples , who live sp@@ ra@@ w@@ led across P@@ a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s ver@@ d@@ ant central hi@@ gh@@ lands .
many joined the Free P@@ a@@ pu@@ a M@@ ov@@ ement ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans by launching s@@ por@@ a@@ dic attacks and kid@@ na@@ pping ra@@ ids on Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders ha@@ il from P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Dan@@ i@@ el Y@@ ud@@ as Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i have been arrested and arbit@@ r@@ arily de@@ tained by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never re@@ appear .
among the people of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a , P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty fe@@ eds the dis@@ content .
the little r@@ ice on sale in En@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i is too expensive for loc@@ als to buy .
bre@@ ad is just as out of reach .
people here grow everything they e@@ at : mainly no@@ ta plus some fruit and le@@ af@@ y vege@@ tables .
farming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the s@@ we@@ et po@@ ta@@ to .
they usually keep most of the har@@ v@@ est for the family , with the rest sold in the local market .
ten pi@@ ec@@ es of no@@ ta cost only 10@@ ,@@ 000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pi@@ ah ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have grown between the na@@ tive P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to N@@ ab@@ ire A@@ ir@@ port .
what few jobs exist typ@@ ically go to the bet@@ ter@@ -@@ educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ thi@@ er migrants .
P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans rar@@ ely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses compet@@ iti@@ vely .
&quot; the young people are not interested to stay in the vill@@ age ... because there &apos;s no jobs or money here , &quot; says J@@ oh@@ n G@@ ob@@ a@@ i , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council of P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i .

in addition , reporting restrictions for international media remain ti@@ ght .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck E@@ sc@@ u@@ die and B@@ asi@@ lle L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were de@@ ported from P@@ a@@ pu@@ a for a &quot; lack of coordination with related institutions &quot; despite having been granted r@@ are permission to film .
according to P@@ h@@ eli@@ m K@@ ine , De@@ pu@@ ty Asia Direc@@ tor of Human Rights Wat@@ ch , J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i &apos;s election campaign pled@@ ges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s res@@ tive eas@@ tern@@ most prov@@ inc@@ es of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a and West P@@ a@@ pu@@ a : visa den@@ ial and bla@@ ck@@ lis@@ ting , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government has been largely limited to P@@ a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s immediate neigh@@ bor@@ s .
in March , six Pac@@ i@@ fic nations - T@@ ong@@ a , Na@@ ur@@ u , P@@ ala@@ u , T@@ u@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ shall Islands , and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands - urged the U@@ .@@ N@@ . Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a , including the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing .
these same countries have histor@@ ically backed the OP@@ M .
Indones@@ ian Foreign Minis@@ try spo@@ kes@@ person Ar@@ r@@ man@@ a@@ th@@ a N@@ asi@@ r sh@@ ru@@ g@@ ged off the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations , telling journalists in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , &quot; In Indonesia , a democratic system still applies and there &apos;s free media so it &apos;s hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , hea@@ ded by the nation &apos;s human rights amb@@ assa@@ dor K@@ e@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ pur@@ a on May 4 , local people bro@@ ke their silence , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay an@@ ony@@ m@@ ous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 20@@ 19 , but P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans say they are un@@ likely to vote again for J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i .
&quot; J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surroun@@ ded by the people who are involved in the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ a@@ i , the tri@@ bal council chairman .
he wants J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i to know that the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i people , aside from living under the lo@@ om@@ ing threat of a rap@@ ac@@ ious military , w@@ allow in des@@ t@@ itu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ a@@ i says the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i people , like other P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans , consider their vote to J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; he must re@@ pay .
&quot; they don &apos;@@ t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing victims carried out one last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : bur@@ ying one victim &apos;s body on land just opposite the police and military station .
knowing that justice may never be served , at least they won &apos;@@ t let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , head b@@ ow@@ ed .
&quot; what else could we do ? &quot;
D@@ er@@ ec@@ k Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a attacks Robert Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us for cancell@@ ing their re@@ match : &quot; not even his f@@ ans want to see him fight &quot;
heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ x@@ ers Robert Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us and D@@ er@@ ec@@ k Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a were set to fight at Har@@ tw@@ all Ar@@ ena on 27 May .
however , the fight was cancell@@ ed for commercial reasons .
in a recent inter@@ view for I@@ F@@ L TV , Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a lays all the blame on Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us for the cancell@@ ation .
&quot; my fight in Finland was cancell@@ ed , but I &apos;@@ m not the one to blame .
I don &apos;@@ t live in Finland ; I don &apos;@@ t want to sell my tic@@ k@@ ets there .
the reason was my Finnish op@@ pon@@ ent .
he &apos;s so bad that not even his f@@ ans want to see him fight , &quot; Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a pre@@ ac@@ hes .
Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us and Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a had their first fight at a fully pac@@ ked Har@@ tw@@ all Ar@@ ena in December 20@@ 11 .
the judges contro@@ ver@@ si@@ ally declared Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us as the w@@ inner .
tic@@ ket sales for the re@@ match were slow , and promo@@ ter N@@ is@@ se S@@ au@@ er@@ land told I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ San@@ om@@ at in May that the fight was postponed to autumn .
no news of the match was heard ever since .
however , Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a is no longer sorry about the cancell@@ ation .
as it happens , the fight would have been cancell@@ ed anyway , as Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a was ill .
&quot; on Thursday , three days before the fight , I was wo@@ ken by an intense pain .
my her@@ ni@@ a was about to b@@ low up .
at hospi@@ tal , they told me that I needed sur@@ ger@@ y , &quot; Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a says .
Ch@@ is@@ or@@ a says that he is 45 per cent fit right now .
he does not seem to be interested in a re@@ match with Hel@@ en@@ i@@ us , as he has his eyes set on D@@ ill@@ ian W@@ hy@@ te .

fire eng@@ ul@@ f@@ s D@@ ub@@ a@@ i &apos;s &apos; tor@@ ch &apos; s@@ k@@ ys@@ c@@ rap@@ er for second time
a fire ri@@ pped through one of the world &apos;s ta@@ ll@@ est resid@@ ential to@@ w@@ ers in D@@ ub@@ a@@ i on Friday , for@@ cing hundreds of o@@ cc@@ u@@ pan@@ ts to fle@@ e the 3@@ 37 met@@ re@@ -@@ tal@@ l , 7@@ 9@@ -@@ sto@@ re@@ y structure .
it &apos;s the second bla@@ ze to s@@ wee@@ p through the hi@@ gh@@ -@@ rise - which happens to be called the tor@@ ch to@@ wer - in just two years .
the building was eva@@ cu@@ ated , no inju@@ ries were reported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the bla@@ ze .
&quot; we were s@@ le@@ eping and we wo@@ ke up to the fire al@@ arm and people scre@@ aming .
we ran down the sta@@ irs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 5@@ 0@@ th floor , &quot; a resid@@ ent who gave his name as Geor@@ ge told Re@@ u@@ ters .
D@@ ub@@ a@@ i &apos;s civil defence authorities said fi@@ re@@ fighting squ@@ ads put out the bla@@ ze at around 4@@ .@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ 00 G@@ M@@ T ) and were co@@ ol@@ ing the building .
the government said it was working on providing sh@@ el@@ ter for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used on the ex@@ teri@@ ors of tal@@ l buildings across the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch after its 20@@ 15 fire found that most of the damage was to the cla@@ d@@ ding , ex@@ teri@@ or pan@@ ell@@ ing used for dec@@ or@@ ation or insu@@ lation .
in the UK , police have said they believe the system of insu@@ lation and cla@@ d@@ ding pan@@ els on London &apos;s G@@ ren@@ fel@@ l T@@ ow@@ er may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died .
m@@ op@@ ed st@@ olen from a par@@ king area in J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u during the night
a m@@ op@@ ed was st@@ olen from a par@@ king area in J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u some@@ time between 9 p@@ m on Tuesday and 5 am on Wednesday .
the m@@ op@@ ed was st@@ olen from T@@ ik@@ ka@@ m@@ ä@@ enti@@ e 2 in Ni@@ in@@ i@@ va@@ ar@@ a .
the red m@@ op@@ ed is a S@@ ky T@@ e@@ am mon@@ key ,
and its registration number is 2@@ 7@@ -@@ RE@@ V .
the m@@ op@@ ed was found later on Thursday .
the police would like to receive any observations of the m@@ op@@ ed or the the@@ ft via e@@ mail ( T@@ his e@@ mail address is protected against spa@@ m@@ bo@@ ts .
you need J@@ ava@@ S@@ cri@@ pt support to see it ) or by telephone ( 02@@ 95 4@@ 15 3@@ 20 ) .

more than 1 in 5 US travell@@ ers carry prohibited items onto aircraft , survey finds
a survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly smugg@@ led prohibited items past the US Trans@@ portation Security Administra@@ tion chec@@ k@@ points onto the aircraft , including at least 6 per cent who bo@@ ar@@ ded the plan@@ e while un@@ inten@@ tionally carrying prohibited k@@ ni@@ ves or other bla@@ ded objec@@ ts .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered bel@@ ate@@ dly that they had mis@@ ta@@ ken@@ ly travell@@ ed with fi@@ re@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey of more than 1@@ 000 people - which was conducted by a j@@ et@@ -@@ char@@ tering service S@@ tra@@ tos J@@ et Char@@ ters In@@ c . - also found that youn@@ ger travell@@ ers were more likely to fl@@ out the rules .
of the respon@@ d@@ ents who ad@@ mitted kno@@ w@@ ingly trying to fly with something banned by the T@@ S@@ A , 19@@ .@@ 7 per cent were mill@@ en@@ ni@@ als , compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of G@@ ener@@ ation X .
the most common items wh@@ is@@ ked past T@@ S@@ A agents on purpose were food and li@@ qu@@ ids .
more than 3 per cent ad@@ mitted kno@@ w@@ ingly carrying bla@@ ded items past security , while 2.@@ 2 per cent of female respon@@ d@@ ents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of m@@ ale respon@@ d@@ ents also acknowledged inten@@ tionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft .
the company said it sur@@ ve@@ yed travell@@ ers around the country to find out how many had acc@@ iden@@ tally brought contra@@ b@@ and through airport security and how many had done so on purpose .
it &apos;s no surprise that the people most likely to hau@@ l contra@@ b@@ and past security - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - were those who fly the most .
as the company points out , however , the T@@ S@@ A guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain of what li@@ qu@@ ids they can carry or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of stu@@ ff seiz@@ ed by the T@@ S@@ A happens to be for@@ b@@ id@@ den li@@ qu@@ ids .
for a time , people thought the T@@ S@@ A might be tre@@ ating books as contra@@ b@@ and .
li@@ qu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international ones .
EP@@ A Chi@@ ef P@@ ru@@ it@@ t back@@ trac@@ ks on Del@@ a@@ ying O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ E@@ ra Rules to reduce E@@ missions
one day after getting su@@ ed by 15 states , Environ@@ mental Protection Agency chi@@ ef Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t rever@@ sed his earlier decision to delay implementation of O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ era rules reducing emissions of smo@@ g@@ -@@ causing air pollu@@ tants .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t presented the change as his agency being more respon@@ sive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regula@@ tors .
he made no mention of the legal challenge f@@ iled against his prior position in a federal appe@@ als court .
at issue is an O@@ c@@ t@@ . 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 20@@ 15 standards for gro@@ und@@ -@@ level ozone .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; inter@@ fer@@ ing with local decisions or impe@@ ding economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who was O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ oma &apos;s state at@@ tor@@ ney general prior to his appointment by President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp , has long served as a reliable op@@ pon@@ ent of stricter environmental regulations .
since arri@@ ving in Washington , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel industries .
Wednesday &apos;s sud@@ den re@@ vers@@ al is the latest legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s regulatory ro@@ ll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal appe@@ als court in Washington rul@@ ed the EP@@ A administra@@ tor over@@ ste@@ pped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Ob@@ ama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce me@@ than@@ e lea@@ ks .
in a statement issued Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t suggested his ab@@ out@@ -@@ face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EP@@ A &apos;s commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time .
&quot; under previous administrations , EP@@ A would often fail to meet desig@@ nation deadlines , and then wait to be su@@ ed by acti@@ vis@@ t groups and others , agreeing in a settlement to set sche@@ d@@ ules for desig@@ nation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who su@@ ed EP@@ A more than a do@@ zen times in his prior job .
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through l@@ iti@@ g@@ ation , and we take deadlines seriously .
we also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot;
still , the EP@@ A &apos;s statement said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t may at some point once again use his &quot; delay authority and all other authority legally available &quot; to ensure regulations &quot; are founded on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pus@@ hing for a broader re@@ write of the ozone rules .
a House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 20@@ 15 rules at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Sen@@ ate .
new York A@@ tt@@ or@@ ney General E@@ ric Sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man , who led the coalition of states that su@@ ed the EP@@ A this week , said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure .
&quot; the EP@@ A &apos;s re@@ vers@@ al - following our law@@ su@@ its - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6@@ .@@ 7 million New Y@@ or@@ kers , and the over 1@@ 15 million Americans directly imp@@ acted by smo@@ g p@@ ouring into their communities , &quot; Sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man said .
new York was joined in the case by C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , I@@ ll@@ ino@@ is , I@@ ow@@ a , Ma@@ ine , M@@ assa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts , M@@ inn@@ es@@ o@@ ta , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land , Ver@@ mon@@ t and Washington , and the Dis@@ tric@@ t of C@@ olu@@ mb@@ ia .
G@@ ro@@ und@@ -@@ level ozone is created when common pollu@@ tants emit@@ ted by cars , power plants , oil re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sun@@ light .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious brea@@ thing problems among sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
public health advocates and environ@@ men@@ talis@@ ts che@@ ered P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it &apos;s distur@@ bing how much pressure it took to get this com@@ mon@@ sense step from the gu@@ y in charge of protecting the air we brea@@ the , &quot; said L@@ ori An@@ n Bur@@ d of the C@@ enter for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; we &apos;@@ ve got to keep fighting the tru@@ mp administration &apos;s ideological cr@@ us@@ ade to pan@@ der to pollu@@ ters and special interests . &quot;

the vi@@ ro@@ lo@@ gy labor@@ atory of T@@ H@@ L confirmed on Thursday that the fifth meas@@ les infec@@ tion in eastern S@@ av@@ onia was caused by the same virus as the one that caused all previous infec@@ tions .
T@@ H@@ L confirmed that the meas@@ les caught by a person in R@@ an@@ tas@@ al@@ mi on Friday 28 July is of the same virus type as all previous cases in eastern S@@ av@@ onia .
in the light of this information , all infec@@ tions in eastern S@@ av@@ onia are related to the first meas@@ les infec@@ tion discovered in the area in June .
&quot; this is good news , as this means that there are no signs of any other virus types .
however , it &apos;s possible that new infec@@ tions will be discovered after this fifth case until the middle of August , and the danger is@@ n &apos;@@ t over yet , &quot; says M@@ ir@@ k@@ al@@ e@@ ena Er@@ k@@ kil@@ ä , physi@@ ci@@ an in charge of infec@@ tious diseases in basic heal@@ th@@ care services at S@@ os@@ ter@@ i .
no new meas@@ les infec@@ tions or suspic@@ ions of new cases have been discovered after the fifth case .

Finland is getting ready to make legal kil@@ j@@ u
making mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal has not even been considered ,
as the process results not only in alcohol , but also me@@ than@@ ol which is tox@@ ic .
preparing kil@@ j@@ u , a traditional hom@@ e@@ made Finnish alco@@ hol@@ ic be@@ ver@@ age , will be legal next year , while making mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal will not even be considered .
K@@ il@@ j@@ u is prepared through fer@@ mentation , while mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine is made by means of dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation .
the regulation on dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation is based on the fact that the process results not only in alcohol , but also me@@ than@@ ol which is tox@@ ic .
&quot; we ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t seen any political party that is ready to make mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal for everyone , &quot; says Is@@ m@@ o T@@ u@@ om@@ inen , Sen@@ i@@ or Minis@@ teri@@ al advis@@ er from the Minis@@ try of Social Affairs and Health .
when the minis@@ try originally prepared the reform of the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Act , making the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal was not even considered .
furthermore , it was not raised in political debate .
&quot; we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t talk about making dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation legal , &quot; says Member of Parliament O@@ u@@ ti M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä ( National Co@@ al@@ ition Party ) .
she is in the negotiation team of parliamentary groups of parties represented in the Government that discussed the reform of the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Act .
no permission can be obtained for the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine at home , not even with an application .
in addition , its commercial production will remain subject to a lic@@ ence .
T@@ u@@ om@@ inen says that there will be a simple rule to regulate the production of alco@@ hol@@ ic be@@ ver@@ ages at home : alcohol can be made at home if it is fer@@ mented .
this means that , in addition to be@@ er , c@@ id@@ er and w@@ ine , it will be legal to make kil@@ j@@ u at home .
the Government wanted to make the regulations governing alcohol simp@@ ler .
&quot; the new act re@@ moves any requirements related to fla@@ v@@ ouring substances and permits the preparation of kil@@ j@@ u , &quot; M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä speci@@ fies .
in the preparation process , ingredients and any fla@@ v@@ ouring substances produced as a result of the fer@@ mentation process must be clearly identi@@ fiable in the be@@ ver@@ age .
according to the new act , people can prepare as high volu@@ mes of these be@@ ver@@ ages as they want , and hom@@ e@@ made alcohol can also be given as a gi@@ ft .
however , it cannot be sold .
&quot; making kil@@ j@@ u is no longer a problem related to national health in Finland , &quot; T@@ u@@ om@@ inen says .
a much larger change took place in 2004 when any restrictions on impor@@ ting alcohol from E@@ st@@ onia and other EU states were removed .
as much as 75 per cent of all alcohol consum@@ ed in Finland is imported from E@@ st@@ onia .
the alcohol bill is currently being examined by the Minis@@ try of Justice .
the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Act will be discussed in Parliament when the autumn term star@@ ts .
the plenary session will be on 5 September .
the new act will enter into force from the beginning of 20@@ 18 .
&quot; the act has been prepared thoroughly .
it &apos;s like Parliament had taken a stand , &quot; M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä says .

tru@@ mp pressu@@ red Mexico on border wall payment according to lea@@ ked phone call trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of phone calls between US President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been lea@@ ked by the Washington P@@ ost .
on 2@@ 7@@ th January in a phone call to Mexic@@ an president , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to , tru@@ mp urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
the US President ber@@ ated him for publicly denoun@@ cing the wall , re@@ por@@ tedly saying to him &quot; Y@@ ou cannot say that to the press . &quot;
tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vo@@ wed to make Mexico pay for the project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of his first call with A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l were also published reve@@ aling a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr tru@@ mp told Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l a deal for the US to take on refugees hea@@ ded for Australia was &quot; ridiculous , &quot; &quot; ro@@ t@@ ten &quot; and &quot; stu@@ pid , &quot; insis@@ ting the deal , bro@@ ker@@ ed under the Ob@@ ama administration , would make him look like &quot; a d@@ ope &quot; after he had proposed a ban on refugee res@@ et@@ t@@ le@@ ment in the US .
Mr tru@@ mp ended the call after telling Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call all day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d massa@@ cr@@ e : acti@@ vis@@ ts Re@@ en@@ act R@@ ac@@ ist l@@ y@@ n@@ ching as a C@@ all for Justice
a 19@@ 48 For@@ d Mer@@ cur@@ y passed through a group of on@@ loo@@ kers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and ru@@ mb@@ led to@@ ward the small Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Br@@ id@@ ge .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white dri@@ ver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with g@@ un@@ s ste@@ pped forward to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a p@@ ins@@ tri@@ ped su@@ it - took a long dra@@ g on his ci@@ g@@ ar and pe@@ ered through the w@@ ind@@ shi@@ el@@ d .
inside , the o@@ cc@@ u@@ pan@@ ts re@@ el@@ ed in fear .
&quot; we want that n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ r R@@ og@@ er ! &quot; the man bar@@ ked .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ a@@ ms ri@@ pped through the silence as a young black man was dra@@ g@@ ged from the front passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ fic sc@@ ene , which played out on July 22 , is just a re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
but when a no@@ ose is thro@@ wn around the nec@@ k of &quot; R@@ og@@ er , &quot; nearly everyone in the audi@@ ence let out very real g@@ as@@ ps .
since 2005 , civil rights acti@@ vis@@ ts have returned to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Br@@ id@@ ge to rec@@ re@@ ate the night two black cou@@ ples - R@@ og@@ er and Do@@ ro@@ thy M@@ alco@@ m , and Geor@@ ge and Ma@@ e M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y D@@ or@@ se@@ y - were l@@ y@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an in 19@@ 46 .
no one has ever been charged with the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it &apos;s mind b@@ og@@ g@@ ling that all of these years , not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities ; even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one bro@@ o@@ ks , who helps organ@@ iz@@ e the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
&quot; it &apos;s a sta@@ in on a history , but it &apos;s a burden on our sou@@ ls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 7@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old former Georgia state con@@ gres@@ s@@ man and lifelong civil rights acti@@ vis@@ t .
for him , the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual remin@@ der to the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an in@@ justice has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want closure , we want heal@@ ing , we want reconciliation , but we have to have justice first , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;@@ t get to heal@@ ing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot;
a cor@@ on@@ er places a she@@ et over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d l@@ y@@ n@@ ching on July 27 , 19@@ 46 .
according to F@@ B@@ I fil@@ es obtained by N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were sus@@ pected in the l@@ y@@ n@@ ching .
but not one was ever prosecu@@ ted .
though the sus@@ pects have remained at large for decades , civil rights acti@@ vis@@ ts say the tw@@ in moti@@ va@@ tions for the l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ings were always well known throughout town : politics and sex .
in April 19@@ 46 , a Su@@ pre@@ me Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ball@@ ots for the first time during the primary race later that summer .
around the same time of the election , according to the F@@ B@@ I , black shar@@ ec@@ ro@@ pp@@ er R@@ og@@ er M@@ alco@@ m sta@@ b@@ bed Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ es@@ ter , a white lan@@ dow@@ ner , during a fight - os@@ ten@@ sibly over a woman .

on July 25 , 19@@ 46 , Lo@@ y Har@@ ris@@ on , a pro@@ minent white lan@@ dow@@ ner , paid $ 600 to b@@ ai@@ l M@@ alco@@ m out of j@@ ai@@ l , according to the F@@ B@@ I .

&quot; as it turns out it was Har@@ ris@@ on who set up and or@@ dered the mur@@ ders , &quot; one F@@ B@@ I report concludes .
&quot; it is also apparent that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy among state and local law enforcement , who not only took part in the mur@@ ders , dis@@ posed of evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witn@@ esses . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks put it more succ@@ inc@@ tly .
&quot; it was a voting rights massa@@ cr@@ e , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &apos; if you register and if you vote , this is what will happen to you . &apos; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cas@@ san@@ dr@@ a Gre@@ ene has directed the annual re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Br@@ id@@ ge l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ings .
her performance is graphic , gri@@ pping and gro@@ un@@ ded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; we don &apos;@@ t want to talk about the l@@ y@@ n@@ ching because it makes us face the ug@@ lin@@ ess in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;@@ t build a relationship with you , if you won &apos;@@ t hear me , or hear what I &apos;@@ ve been through . &quot;
Re@@ hear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a do@@ zen white and the rest black - cro@@ w@@ ded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene launched into a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ hear@@ sed over@@ view of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh serves as Gre@@ ene &apos;s co@@ -@@ direc@@ tor .
he &apos;s played the part of the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man for years , but he said the role never gets any easier .
&quot; I feel di@@ r@@ ty because this is not who I am , &quot; said Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this history ali@@ ve because we don &apos;@@ t want to go back to those times . &quot;
across the room , actors D@@ arri@@ us Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w and Nic@@ k R@@ as@@ con@@ a , who play R@@ og@@ er M@@ alco@@ m and Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ es@@ ter , re@@ hear@@ sed their lines .
the play beg@@ ins with M@@ alco@@ m sh@@ ou@@ ting and sh@@ ov@@ ing H@@ es@@ ter , li@@ vi@@ d that he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ eping with his wi@@ fe , Do@@ ro@@ thy .
&quot; I said n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ a , get off my property ! &quot;
R@@ as@@ con@@ a fires back .
there &apos;s a be@@ at .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) bur@@ s@@ ts into lau@@ ghter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh@@ s the har@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; R@@ as@@ con@@ a asked .
he &apos;s al@@ armed , confused .
did I go too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said through c@@ hu@@ c@@ kl@@ es .
&quot; I just don &apos;@@ t think white people back then said &apos; n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ a . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ea , &quot; one of the other black cast members qu@@ ip@@ ped .
&quot; you have to hit the hard &apos; R@@ . &apos; &quot;
and just like that the energy in the room shif@@ ts ; a sense of ca@@ mar@@ ad@@ er@@ i@@ e re@@ places the dis@@ comfor@@ t .
everyone is dedicated to getting this right , not only for the sake of the play , but also for the memor@@ y of the four people killed .
the sc@@ ene beg@@ ins again .
this time , when R@@ as@@ con@@ a says the N@@ -@@ word , it &apos;s shar@@ p and emp@@ ha@@ tic .
absolutely no one lau@@ gh@@ s .
the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there &apos;s scre@@ a@@ ms , g@@ un@@ fire and then , silence .
a woman d@@ res@@ sed in fun@@ er@@ al black , stands over the actors bodies and per@@ forms B@@ illi@@ e Hol@@ id@@ ay &apos;s m@@ our@@ n@@ ful e@@ ul@@ og@@ y , &quot; strange F@@ ru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks on every other word .
a hundred y@@ ards back , a group of about four do@@ zen spec@@ ta@@ tors wi@@ pe s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars away from their eyes .
the audi@@ ence is almost even@@ ly split between black and white .
one couple has tra@@ vel@@ ed from I@@ th@@ ac@@ a , New York , to see the performance , many are from just down the road .
they &apos;@@ ve all wea@@ ther@@ ed Georgia &apos;s op@@ pressive hu@@ mid@@ ity for the nearly eight hours as bro@@ o@@ ks lead them on a pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and D@@ or@@ se@@ ys .
up until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ e , but now , standing on the same land where the l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ings took place , the air feels ha@@ un@@ ted .
as the final notes of the s@@ ong f@@ ade , Gre@@ ene invi@@ tes the cro@@ w@@ d to move closer and ins@@ pect the bodies .
children cro@@ uc@@ h by their heads , take in the fa@@ ke blood and still bodies , and wh@@ is@@ per to each other .
&quot; they &apos;@@ re not really dead , &quot; one little bo@@ y mu@@ t@@ ters , as if to remind himself .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the cro@@ w@@ d , and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw off the l@@ y@@ n@@ ching ro@@ pe and wi@@ pe away te@@ ars .
Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh , the man in the su@@ it who played the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man .
Nic@@ k R@@ as@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his cas@@ t@@ ma@@ tes , and then breaks down cr@@ ying in their arms ; the emo@@ tional tol@@ l of the performance finally getting to him .
&quot; it &apos;s o@@ ka@@ y , &quot; one of the women wh@@ is@@ pers .
&quot; we know that &apos;s not what &apos;s in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later , the audi@@ ence s@@ its down to d@@ inner with the actors .
at one table , a white couple from A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta cha@@ ts an@@ ima@@ tedly about the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment with a black couple they just met .
D@@ en@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ ins@@ ki strugg@@ led to find words for how the performance made her feel .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear those horri@@ ble aw@@ ful words , and de@@ eds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; what this really does to me is make me think that l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ings are still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; they &apos;@@ re just called police sho@@ ot@@ ings now . &quot;
across the room , T@@ yr@@ one bro@@ o@@ ks holds court at his table , e@@ ating and R@@ em@@ inis@@ cing about civil rights .
he said he &apos;s already begun planning for next year &apos;s performance .
&quot; the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment is inspi@@ rational in a way because it descri@@ bes the hor@@ ro@@ r of what we endu@@ red , but it also is a teaching moment , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like , if you don &apos;@@ t learn from this , it can happen again .
those who don &apos;@@ t study their history , those who do not know their history , are do@@ om@@ ed to repeat it . &quot;
te@@ aring vege@@ tables in sh@@ ops he@@ ats up feelings : this is how much you can actually save by removing &quot; extra parts &quot;
can cau@@ lif@@ lower leaves be removed before w@@ eigh@@ ing ?
what about the large top of a p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple ? after all , it w@@ eigh@@ s who knows how much .
people are divided : for some , this is an indication of extreme st@@ ing@@ iness , some do not want to pay for the parts that they will not use and that they would throw away anyway .
this is an everyday phenomenon in sh@@ ops .
for example , empty car@@ d@@ board bo@@ xes have been placed in the vegetable section of K@@ -@@ C@@ it@@ y@@ market Ru@@ oh@@ ol@@ a@@ h@@ ti in Helsinki because many , for example , remove cau@@ lif@@ lower leaves .
when placed in these bo@@ xes , the leaves are then dis@@ posed of as bio@@ waste .
according to news published by T@@ al@@ ous@@ san@@ om@@ at , sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ pers are ama@@ z@@ ed by this behaviour .
how much can you really save by removing unnecessary parts before w@@ eigh@@ ing ?
how effective is this really ?
me Na@@ is@@ et ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine tested what the price of a p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple , ar@@ tic@@ ho@@ ke , mus@@ h@@ room , bro@@ cc@@ oli and cau@@ lif@@ lower is after any unnecessary parts are removed .
C@@ au@@ lif@@ lower : the price of a cau@@ lif@@ lower originally EUR 2.@@ 10 was EUR 1.@@ 80 after all the leaves were removed .
p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple : the price of a full p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple of EUR 2@@ .30 fel@@ l to EUR 1.@@ 95 after the top was removed .
Ar@@ tic@@ ho@@ ke : the price dro@@ pped from EUR 2.@@ 60 to EUR 2.@@ 40 after the base was cut off .
mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms : the total price of two mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms was EUR 0.@@ 75 .
without the base , their price was EUR 0.@@ 60 .
bro@@ cc@@ oli : a medi@@ um@@ -@@ sized bro@@ cc@@ oli cost EUR 1 , and the price decreas@@ ed to EUR 0.@@ 80 after the base was removed .
results : if any unnecessary parts are removed , you can save a few do@@ zen c@@ ents when bu@@ ying a single vegetable .
in percentage terms , the price decreas@@ ed by as much as 20 per cent .
therefore , you could have sa@@ ved EUR 1.@@ 20 from the a@@ fore@@ mentioned purch@@ ases !
Ne@@ y@@ mar b@@ ought out of Barcelona - the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian sta@@ r signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal with P@@ S@@ G
AF@@ P reports that Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian sta@@ r pla@@ yer Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal with French football clu@@ b Paris S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main ( P@@ S@@ G ) .
earlier in Thursday evening it was reported that Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s representatives had paid the release fe@@ e of EUR 2@@ 22 million to F@@ C Barcelona playing in the Spanish Pr@@ im@@ era D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón .
the incredi@@ ble transfer fe@@ e of EUR 2@@ 22 million is the highest fe@@ e ever paid in the history of football .
the earlier record was held by Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United which paid EUR 10@@ 5 million for French P@@ aul P@@ og@@ ba last summer .
the Pr@@ im@@ era D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón fro@@ ze the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempted by Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s representatives .
according to the rules of the Pr@@ im@@ era D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón , a bu@@ ying clu@@ b cannot pay a fe@@ e mat@@ ching the release clause directly to the se@@ ller , but the pla@@ yer must pay himself out of his deal . this takes place by passing the fe@@ e through the Pr@@ im@@ era D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón .
in practice , P@@ S@@ G paid the sum to Ne@@ y@@ mar and his representatives who , through the Pr@@ im@@ era D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón , for@@ war@@ ded the funds to Barcelona .
Ne@@ y@@ mar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday .
he will possibly be presented to his new home cro@@ w@@ d at P@@ S@@ G &apos;s se@@ as@@ on op@@ en@@ er against A@@ mi@@ ens on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A to investigate the details
in a press release , Barcelona announced that it will send information about the fe@@ e to the Union of European F@@ o@@ ot@@ ball As@@ soci@@ ations ( U@@ E@@ F@@ A ) so that it can define any disciplinary actions resulting from the transfer .
for example , J@@ avi@@ er T@@ eb@@ as , president of L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a de F@@ ú@@ t@@ bo@@ l Pro@@ f@@ esi@@ onal , the Spanish association of professional football , has sus@@ pected that P@@ S@@ G is in breach of the rules of U@@ E@@ F@@ A &apos;s financial fair play through its spending .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A has the right to impose sanctions on a clu@@ b that produc@@ es losses of more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years .
according to U@@ E@@ F@@ A , Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s transfer does not automatically viol@@ ate these rules .
Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s transfer to P@@ S@@ G will have an impact on the clu@@ b &apos;s finances for several years , but this impact cannot be evalu@@ ated be@@ fore@@ hand .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A stated that P@@ S@@ G may , for example , sell players at significant fe@@ es .
P@@ S@@ G is ow@@ ned by Qa@@ tar S@@ ports Investment , a sta@@ te@@ -@@ ow@@ ned company from Qa@@ tar .
the clu@@ b &apos;s chairman is N@@ ass@@ er al@@ -@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f@@ i , a former te@@ n@@ n@@ is pro from Qa@@ tar .

P@@ ear@@ son cuts another 3@@ ,@@ 000 jobs , s@@ las@@ hes divid@@ end to revi@@ ve business
British education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday it would cut another 3@@ ,@@ 000 jobs and s@@ las@@ h its interim divid@@ end by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressu@@ res facing its business .
the job cuts , which Chi@@ ef Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive J@@ oh@@ n F@@ all@@ on said will mos@@ tly come late in 20@@ 18 and in early 20@@ 19 , are in addition to 4@@ ,@@ 000 ro@@ les lost in its previous restructuring .
P@@ ear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million p@@ ounds ( $ 3@@ 9@@ 4@@ -@@ million U@@ .@@ S@@ . ) in May in a third cos@@ t@@ -@@ cutting programme to try to revi@@ ve a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ an@@ dom House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann last month , said its out@@ look for the year was un@@ changed after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.@@ 05 billion p@@ ounds .
Kab@@ u@@ l con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO sol@@ di@@ er killed in suicide b@@ last
a suicide bom@@ ber has atta@@ cked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afghan capital , Kab@@ u@@ l , killing a Na@@ to sol@@ di@@ er and w@@ oun@@ ding several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were inju@@ red , a Na@@ to statement said .
un@@ confirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city &apos;s Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h dis@@ tric@@ t .
the bom@@ bing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que b@@ last in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ ass@@ y in Kab@@ u@@ l .
a Na@@ to statement said that Thursday evening &apos;s b@@ last happened when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was atta@@ cked by a &quot; per@@ s@@ onn@@ el@@ -@@ borne im@@ prov@@ ised explo@@ sive de@@ vice . &quot;
the statement said that all those inju@@ red are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospi@@ tal at Bag@@ ra@@ m air@@ field .
cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so@@ -@@ called Islamic State ( is ) in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h is a major source of concern to Na@@ to forces based in ne@@ ar@@ by Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , Afghanistan saw at least 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in the first half of 20@@ 17 , with about 20 % of those in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bom@@ b killed at least 30 people in a mainly S@@ h@@ ia dis@@ tric@@ t of Kab@@ u@@ l .
the Taliban said they had carried out that attack .
on 31 May , a huge bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , the dead@@ li@@ est mili@@ tant attack in the country since U@@ S@@ -@@ led forces ous@@ ted the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ar@@ ious security situation in Afghanistan as US President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp w@@ eigh@@ s up whether to increase the number of US troops aid@@ ing the military and police in the country .
cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ents say the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ u@@ l in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the repu@@ tation of President A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f G@@ han@@ i .
EP@@ A re@@ vers@@ es decision to delay smo@@ g rule after law@@ su@@ its
the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Environ@@ mental Protection Agency rever@@ sed a decision to delay an O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ era rule requiring states to cur@@ b smo@@ g@@ -@@ causing emissions , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency over the move .
the EP@@ A announced the decision to go ahead with the so@@ -@@ called &quot; 20@@ 15 O@@ zone D@@ es@@ ig@@ nations &quot; late on Wednesday , saying it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to working with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with , and being respon@@ sive to , our state partners , &quot; EP@@ A Chi@@ ef Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t said in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in June had announced the EP@@ A &apos;s intention to delay the ozone desig@@ nations - in which existing smo@@ g pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tou@@ gh@@ er air quality standard - by one year to October 20@@ 18 .
a group of 15 mos@@ tly Democratic states , along with the Dis@@ tric@@ t of C@@ olu@@ mb@@ ia , f@@ iled a su@@ it on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal .
the administration of President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp has been seeking to ro@@ ll back a wide ar@@ ra@@ y of environmental regulations imposed by former President Bar@@ ac@@ k Ob@@ ama , as part of a broader agenda tru@@ mp says is aimed at spar@@ king economic growth .
but the efforts have tri@@ gg@@ ered pus@@ h@@ back by Democ@@ ra@@ tics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EP@@ A &apos;s web@@ site says brea@@ thing air containing ozone &quot; can reduce lun@@ g function and increase res@@ pi@@ ra@@ tory sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s &quot; like as@@ th@@ ma .
S@@ yd@@ ney Mor@@ ning Her@@ al@@ d reports that one of the leaders of IS@@ IS had also sent parts of a bom@@ b to S@@ yd@@ ney .
according to the sus@@ pects , their intention was to plant the bom@@ b on a plan@@ e on 15 July , but their attempt failed before the security chec@@ k@@ point .
the police have not disc@@ los@@ ed any details of why the attempt failed .
another plan of the sus@@ pected terrorists was to build a mach@@ ine that spre@@ ads a col@@ our@@ less tox@@ ic gas and carry it to a public place full of people , such as a public transport vehicle .
Mic@@ ha@@ el P@@ hel@@ an , a de@@ pu@@ ty commission@@ er of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ian Federal Pol@@ ice , says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia .
due to the plans of sus@@ pected terrorists , four men were ap@@ prehen@@ ded in police ra@@ ids on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
one of the men has been released , but his inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations will also be continued later .

M@@ ik@@ e@@ y Gar@@ ci@@ a and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible sh@@ ow@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko and M@@ ik@@ e@@ y Gar@@ ci@@ a , who should be on a coll@@ ision course to stage the most compe@@ lling bo@@ xing match under 14@@ 7 p@@ ounds in the near future , met each other for the first time Thursday .
they were in separate ro@@ oms at ES@@ P@@ N offices in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es until Gar@@ ci@@ a , the un@@ be@@ a@@ ten World bo@@ xing Council li@@ gh@@ tw@@ eight champ@@ ion , wal@@ ked down the hall@@ way to gre@@ et Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko , the World bo@@ xing Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation super@@ -@@ fea@@ ther@@ weight champ@@ ion .

best of lu@@ ck to you . &quot;
Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko def@@ ends his bel@@ t against Migu@@ el Mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ a on Sa@@ tur@@ day night at 7 on ES@@ P@@ N .
as the pair posed for p@@ ho@@ tos , Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko manag@@ er E@@ g@@ is K@@ li@@ mas noted that a potential sh@@ ow@@ down between the fi@@ gh@@ ters would be &quot; perfect siz@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;@@ m a former fea@@ ther@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ ci@@ a reminded .
&quot; I moved up for Br@@ on@@ er &#91; at 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds &#93; , but I &apos;@@ m not that big .
I &apos;@@ m small for 1@@ 40 .
I want to come down to li@@ gh@@ tw@@ eight .
and he &apos;s got to move up to li@@ gh@@ tw@@ eight &#91; 1@@ 35 p@@ ounds &#93; and then we have a fight .
that &apos;s what the f@@ ans are asking for .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko agreed .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
K@@ li@@ mas asked if it should be on pay@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ view , part of a strategy he has to have Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko fight a 13@@ 5@@ -@@ p@@ ound de@@ but b@@ out later this year to set up a date next summer with Gar@@ ci@@ a ( 3@@ 7@@ -@@ 0 , 30 kno@@ c@@ k@@ ou@@ ts ) , who also has interest in fighting the J@@ or@@ ge L@@ in@@ ar@@ es@@ -@@ Lu@@ ke Ca@@ mp@@ bel@@ l w@@ inner following their Sep@@ t . 23 li@@ gh@@ tw@@ eight title b@@ out at the Forum .
&quot; this fight could be on pay@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ view because all the f@@ ans have been asking about it , &quot; Gar@@ ci@@ a said , later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re the main names .
no other names can generate that kind of attention .
whenever they &apos;@@ re ready ... . &quot;
Gar@@ ci@@ a said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko as &quot; a tremendous fi@@ ghter , &quot; and may attend his Sa@@ tur@@ day b@@ out .
but Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko pa@@ used at la@@ v@@ ish praise for Gar@@ ci@@ a , saying he thought the thre@@ e@@ -@@ division champ@@ ion from ri@@ ver@@ side looked &quot; very slow , sorry M@@ ik@@ e@@ y ... you wanted the kno@@ ck@@ out . &quot;
Gar@@ ci@@ a said the focus was to show pun@@ ching strength , then box .
they both said they can feel the momentum building for their own b@@ out .
&quot; this is the fight to be made .
no other fight creates as much attention and bu@@ z@@ z .
I &apos;@@ m more than happy to work at it , &quot; Gar@@ ci@@ a said .
said Lom@@ ac@@ hen@@ ko : &quot; I &apos;@@ ve wai@@ ted for the top fi@@ gh@@ ters , and this is M@@ ik@@ e@@ y .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
average mon@@ thly salary EUR 5@@ ,@@ 300 , regardless of education - the &quot; W@@ ild West &quot; of investment advis@@ ors
the quality of investment advice has raised much debate .
most recently , Hel@@ sing@@ in San@@ om@@ at wrote about R@@ it@@ va , 68 , to whom an investment advis@@ or of a banking firm talked complete non@@ sense when selling investment products .
regulations governing investment advis@@ ors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year .
these are based on the new Mar@@ k@@ ets in Financial In@@ str@@ u@@ ments Directive which will be applied starting from the beginning of next year .
currently , the evaluation of the competence of investment advis@@ ors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation .
no competence requirements are defined in the legislation .
finance Finland ( F@@ F@@ I ) recommen@@ ds that individuals working in investment services complete its A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 or A@@ V@@ P@@ 2 qualifications .
F@@ F@@ I has as@@ signed the provision of its qualifications to AP@@ V Investment examin@@ ations L@@ t@@ d , whose qualifications team consists of experts from the Financial Su@@ per@@ visory Authority , universities and companies operating in the field .
the qualifications require 12@@ -@@ 15 cred@@ its and their examin@@ ations are prepared by A@@ al@@ to Uni@@ versity Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive Education which offers development services for business management .
its web@@ site says that both of its examin@@ ations have &quot; fairly extensive requirements . &quot;
the study material consists of 10@@ -@@ 15 books and a number of other guid@@ es and journ@@ als .
Mar@@ k@@ k@@ u S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , managing direc@@ tor of AP@@ V Investment examin@@ ations L@@ t@@ d , says that rou@@ gh@@ ly 70 per cent of those who take the examin@@ ations pass .
&quot; when it comes to the largest banks , nearly all of their employees who sell investment services have completed either A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 or A@@ P@@ V@@ 2 qualifications , as this is a mandatory requirement set out in their own rules .
then again , there are smaller banking firms - I don &apos;@@ t want to name any names - whose employees seem to ste@@ er clear of these qualifications , &quot; S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says .
according to S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , there are &quot; a few &quot; banking firms like this .
S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says that , since 2000 , 13@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ 14@@ ,@@ 000 people have completed A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 qualifications , while rou@@ gh@@ ly 3@@ ,@@ 000 people have completed the more demanding A@@ P@@ V@@ 2 qualifications recommended for investment advis@@ ors .
some banking firms consider the qualifications to offer an advantage .
many other business fields are regulated by much stricter competence requirements .
S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says that the F@@ F@@ I recommendation requires that AP@@ V qualifications are completed , as they secure inves@@ t@@ men@@ t@@ -@@ related competence .
according to Sta@@ tis@@ tics Finland , the average mon@@ thly ear@@ nings of financial and investment advis@@ ors are several thousands of euros , including fe@@ es , fr@@ in@@ ge benefits and prof@@ it@@ -@@ based b@@ on@@ uses .
the average mon@@ thly salary of regular employees is rou@@ gh@@ ly EUR 5@@ ,@@ 300 .
the average mon@@ thly salary of men in this line of work is more than EUR 5@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 and that of women is more than EUR 4@@ ,@@ 500 .
the top ten per cent receiving the highest salary ear@@ ns rou@@ gh@@ ly EUR 8@@ ,@@ 100 ,
with men ear@@ ning more than EUR 9@@ ,@@ 000 a month and women receiving EUR 6@@ ,@@ 400 or more .
investment advice in accordance with the Act on Investment Ser@@ vices can only be offered by a lic@@ ens@@ ed company .
so far , employees and positions have been governed by means of sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation .
an inspection by the Financial Su@@ per@@ visory Authority revealed individual cases where the professional skills and competence of investment advis@@ ors were not at a sufficient level on the basis of their actions .
&quot; in principle , an employe@@ e can sell investment products , even if their professional skills or competence levels are low .
basically , the situation has been un@@ regulated .
many other business fields are regulated by much stricter competence requirements , &quot; S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says .
according to S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , regulations will become stricter from the beginning of next year as a result of the new Mar@@ k@@ ets in Financial In@@ str@@ u@@ ments Directive ( Mi@@ F@@ I@@ D II ) .
it demands every company to ensure that their employees who offer investment services have sufficient skills .
the Financial Su@@ per@@ visory Authority will be authorised to decide what types of skills employees need .
Mar@@ ko H@@ ov@@ i , senior market super@@ vis@@ or at the Financial Su@@ per@@ visory Authority , says that one of the most significant changes is the requirement for the competence and experience of investment advis@@ ors and employees who sell investment products .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , the new requirements apply to the staff of investment service companies and their partner agents who sell products on their behalf .
H@@ ov@@ i says that , according to the Government proposal issued by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance , the Financial Su@@ per@@ visory Authority will be authorised to decide on the competence and experience required .
what the exact levels are will be decided later in the autumn .
in the future , companies must see to necessary training and , if required , monitoring and continuing training .
all of this needs to be docu@@ mented , and companies will be oblig@@ ated to prove that this has been done .
H@@ ov@@ i speci@@ fies that , in practice , companies need to define the job descri@@ p@@ tions of every employe@@ e .
it is expected that there will be different requirement levels , depending on whether an employe@@ e is an investment advis@@ or or a se@@ ller of investment products .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , another addition is the requirement to work for a specific period with a more experienced employe@@ e , if a person &apos;s competence or experience is not at a sufficient level .
this means that , if a company recru@@ its a new employe@@ e who does not meet the criteria set , that employe@@ e needs to work with a more experienced employe@@ e for a pre@@ -@@ defined time .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , these changes will make the regulations stricter and more concrete .
the legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter from the beginning of 20@@ 18 .

this week &apos;s s@@ wi@@ m schools have 13 young students , and next week there will be close to ten children .

on Thursday , everybody was having a good time on Li@@ ete be@@ ach .
the su@@ n was sh@@ ining and the young students were training how to flo@@ at with po@@ ol no@@ od@@ les , some even without them .
even the youn@@ g@@ est ones were enjo@@ ying the water .
I@@ ines K@@ a@@ ik@@ k@@ on@@ en , 5 , first had her doubts about going deep@@ er .
however , Ta@@ ina I@@ t@@ k@@ on@@ en encouraged her to s@@ wi@@ m towards the shor@@ e .
well done !
I@@ ines K@@ a@@ ik@@ k@@ on@@ en says that she has sw@@ um a lot this summer .
she thinks that the Li@@ ete be@@ ach is a good place to s@@ wi@@ m .

the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er se@@ lls to@@ il@@ et br@@ us@@ hes - &quot; T@@ here &apos;s a uni@@ fying story &quot;
you would have to see it to believe it .
two days ago , S@@ in@@ itu@@ ot@@ e , a manufac@@ tu@@ rer of clean@@ ing products , launched the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er product range ,
that is , dis@@ h br@@ us@@ hes , to@@ we@@ l rac@@ ks and &quot; a to@@ il@@ et br@@ us@@ h a ri@@ m clean@@ er . &quot;
here , the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er refers to the film which premi@@ ers in the autumn and its marketing .
still , there is something pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar about this combination , and the products have been targeted in social media : when can we expect the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er san@@ i@@ tary na@@ p@@ kin@@ s ?
there is nothing for it , but to call the company and ask them what this is all about .
what does A@@ ino M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , vice president at S@@ in@@ itu@@ ot@@ e , have to say ?
&quot; we are one of the spon@@ sor@@ s of the up@@ coming film .
we support this film , just like many other companies .
our aim was to support Finnish production and a c@@ ult film , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä says .
according to M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , the products will be on special dis@@ play in sh@@ ops , giving visi@@ bility to the film .
is@@ n &apos;@@ t there something fun@@ n@@ y about this ? after all , one would think that there is something in common between S@@ ini &apos;s products and the stor@@ ies linked with them .
&quot; there &apos;s a uni@@ fying story in that we are a Finnish company and these are Finnish products , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä says .
according to M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , the company follows the same set of fundamental Finnish values as those who have seen the original un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er .
&quot; what is more , clean@@ ing is not that un@@ usual in the army , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä points out .
other spon@@ sor@@ s of the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er include V@@ ali@@ o , Har@@ tw@@ all , S@@ alu@@ do , V@@ R and Sa@@ to .
so far , Har@@ tw@@ all has launched car@@ b@@ on@@ ated water under the names of Ro@@ k@@ ka , Hi@@ e@@ tan@@ en and K@@ os@@ kel@@ a .
K@@ a@@ lle K@@ inn@@ un@@ en who w@@ ri@@ tes a blo@@ g for Su@@ om@@ en Ku@@ val@@ eh@@ ti has already talked about products linked with the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er .
there are also the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er co@@ ff@@ e@@ es and wat@@ ches .
K@@ inn@@ un@@ en points out that there is still a long time to go before the film premi@@ ers , so we should expect more to come .
he w@@ ri@@ tes that , of all the spon@@ sor@@ s of the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er , V@@ ali@@ o , J@@ al@@ os@@ ta@@ ja , N@@ es@@ te and German re@@ ta@@ il chain L@@ id@@ l are still to launch their own militar@@ y@@ -@@ them@@ ed products .
new results of Sweden &apos;s asylum age assessment tests released
the latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medic@@ ally assessing their age show that over 80 per@@ cent tested were judged to be older than 18 , but not everyone has faith in their accura@@ cy .
Sweden &apos;s national for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency ( R@@ ä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ k@@ et ) started carrying out the tests earlier year .
they are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Mi@@ gration Agency ( Mi@@ gra@@ tion@@ s@@ ver@@ k@@ et ) was critic@@ iz@@ ed for fail@@ ings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claim@@ ing to be under@@ age .
to date Mi@@ gra@@ tion@@ s@@ ver@@ k@@ et has sent 6@@ ,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested , and the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period between mid March until July 3@@ 1@@ st , 20@@ 17 .
eigh@@ ty per@@ cent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency judged that the subject was &quot; possibly 18 or over . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is in question .
according to J@@ oh@@ an G@@ ö@@ ran@@ s@@ son from the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he told The L@@ oc@@ al .
the high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum se@@ e@@ ker li@@ ed about their age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 ins@@ tances that &quot; suggest the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
when newspaper s@@ ven@@ s@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ de@@ t investig@@ ated the 5@@ 81 results released however it found that in 2@@ 43 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which consists of taking X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys of wisdom te@@ et@@ h and M@@ R@@ I s@@ can@@ s of k@@ ne@@ e join@@ ts , then having d@@ ent@@ ists and radi@@ olog@@ ists analyse them , has also been criticised in some quarters .
one scep@@ tic is Kar@@ ol@@ ins@@ ka Institu@@ te en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist C@@ la@@ ude Mar@@ c@@ us , whose work includes assessing the biological ma@@ tur@@ ity of people to see if they went through pu@@ b@@ er@@ ty earlier or later than usual .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;@@ t think the type of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment being used should be .
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we can &apos;@@ t say it for sure we shoul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t pre@@ tend that we can , &quot; he told newspaper met@@ ro .
the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency &apos;s G@@ ö@@ ran@@ s@@ son defended the accura@@ cy of the tests however : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of in@@ accura@@ tely jud@@ ging a child to be an ad@@ ult is small .
the biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it &apos;s around 10 per@@ cent . &quot;

M@@ r@@ . tru@@ mp promised earlier a big announcement at the West V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia ra@@ lly .
M@@ r@@ . tru@@ mp won West V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia by 42 points , and Justice did not endorse the Democratic n@@ om@@ ine@@ e , H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton .

&quot; with only 15 govern@@ or@@ ships and control of the fe@@ west state legisla@@ tures in history , Govern@@ or Justice &apos;s announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is le@@ ad@@ er@@ less from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; R@@ N@@ C chair@@ woman R@@ onn@@ a Mc@@ Dan@@ i@@ el said in a statement to C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws .
li@@ ght@@ ning w@@ rea@@ ks ha@@ vo@@ c - summer &apos;s most intense th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms expected for Thursday
at the end of the week , th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms will also reach southern Finland .
this week , there have been frequent th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , especially in central and northern Finland , as well as in sou@@ th@@ west Finland .
during the night between Wednesday and Thursday , s@@ tro@@ k@@ es of li@@ ght@@ ning ig@@ ni@@ ted several fires .
according to a me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ log@@ ist , this summer &apos;s most intense th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are expected for Thursday .
Th@@ under@@ sh@@ ow@@ ers have finally found their way to Finland .
this week , there have been frequent th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , especially in central and northern Finland , as well as in sou@@ th@@ west Finland .
in P@@ ö@@ y@@ ty@@ ä , li@@ ght@@ ning struck the distribution board of a ter@@ rac@@ ed house , ign@@ iting a small fire .
the res@@ c@@ ue depart@@ ment obtained information about the fire 15 minutes before mid@@ night on Wednesday .
the distribution board was located in a sa@@ una at the end of the ter@@ rac@@ ed house .
res@@ c@@ ue personnel dismant@@ led parts of the ro@@ of and wall in order to loc@@ ate any fire po@@ ck@@ ets and ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished the fire quickly .
el@@ even a@@ part@@ ments were left without electricity , but no@@ -@@ one was inju@@ red .
in Lo@@ ima@@ a , li@@ ght@@ ning set a sh@@ ed on fire in Har@@ j@@ ul@@ anti@@ e a little before mid@@ night .
when the res@@ c@@ ue personnel arrived on site , the building was in fla@@ mes and the res@@ c@@ ue personnel were only able to prevent the fire from spre@@ ading .
the sh@@ ed of rou@@ gh@@ ly 50 squ@@ are met@@ res bur@@ ned to the ground .
in R@@ ä@@ ä@@ k@@ ky@@ l@@ ä near Ku@@ op@@ io , li@@ ght@@ ning struck a deta@@ ched house .
the residents were out@@ doors to witness the s@@ tro@@ ke of li@@ ght@@ ning .
the res@@ c@@ ue personnel arrived on site to investigate the situation , but this time the li@@ ght@@ ning did not cause any fire - it only bur@@ nt some f@@ uses .
in traffic , th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms caused problems on the railway line between Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki and V@@ a@@ as@@ a when a s@@ tro@@ ke of li@@ ght@@ ning dama@@ ged the traffic control system .
information about the fault was obtained on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 am , after which scheduled traffic was replaced by bus@@ es .
the problems was only re@@ pa@@ ired a little before 5 p@@ m ,
after which railway traffic has continued normally , also in the track section dama@@ ged by li@@ ght@@ ning .
th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms have w@@ rea@@ ked ha@@ vo@@ c in different parts of Finland .
however , there have been fairly few li@@ ght@@ ning f@@ las@@ hes this summer .
&quot; this summer &apos;s th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms have been utterly ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish ! &quot; says me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ log@@ ist J@@ ar@@ i T@@ u@@ ov@@ inen from the Finnish M@@ e@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Institu@@ te .
the inten@@ s@@ ity of the th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms on Wednesday and Thursday was mainly moder@@ ate but , due to the poor li@@ ght@@ ning situation this summer , many regarded them as heavy stor@@ ms .
&quot; these could be considered to be heavy th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , and that &apos;s what they were compared with other stor@@ ms this summer , &quot; T@@ u@@ ov@@ inen says .
on Wednesday , there were 1@@ ,@@ 700 f@@ las@@ hes of cl@@ ou@@ d@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ground li@@ ght@@ ning , and this summer &apos;s most intense th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are expected for Thursday : by 4 p@@ m , there have already been 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 90 f@@ las@@ hes of li@@ ght@@ ning .
&quot; if the stor@@ ms extend to the evening , we can have more than 2@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ las@@ hes , &quot; T@@ u@@ ov@@ inen says .
the previous rec@@ ord@@ -@@ low li@@ ght@@ ning year was in 20@@ 15 when the f@@ las@@ h counter showed a total of 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ las@@ hes .
by Wednesday , there have been 18@@ ,@@ 3@@ 86 f@@ las@@ hes this year .
there is still some cat@@ ching up to do in order not to break the &quot; record &quot; made two years ago .
however , more stor@@ ms can be expected .
according to T@@ u@@ ov@@ inen , the air mass over Finland will be warm and dr@@ y throughout the week , forming an ideal environment for th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms .
by Sa@@ tur@@ day , stor@@ ms are expected to head south where 2@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ las@@ hes can be recorded both on Sa@@ tur@@ day and on S@@ un@@ day .
more constant ra@@ in is expected in central parts of Finland .
according to T@@ u@@ ov@@ inen , such wea@@ ther rar@@ ely gener@@ ates li@@ ght@@ ning .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &apos; can@@ did &apos; Russian apolog@@ y for dop@@ ing scandal
global a@@ th@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s Se@@ bas@@ tian Co@@ e p@@ raised what he described as a can@@ did apolog@@ y from Russia over a dop@@ ing scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
Russia &apos;s a@@ th@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lak@@ h@@ tin told an I@@ A@@ A@@ F Congress , held on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , that his country &apos;s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
he said he was sorry to &quot; all a@@ th@@ le@@ tes who have had g@@ old and sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ als s@@ n@@ at@@ ched from them at compet@@ itions . &quot;
despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ A@@ F Congress voted in f@@ avo@@ r of maintaining the ban , imposed in November 20@@ 15 after a World An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) report found evidence of sta@@ te@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very can@@ did response today , a very can@@ did presentation , &quot; I@@ A@@ A@@ F president Co@@ e told re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian feder@@ ation rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed themselves that they have been through some pre@@ tty tor@@ rid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the feder@@ ation is re@@ engine@@ ered . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to re@@ insta@@ te Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ ali@@ ze this situation .
the guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean a@@ th@@ le@@ tes from the tain@@ ted system , &quot; he added
n@@ ine@@ teen Russian a@@ th@@ le@@ tes will be compet@@ ing as neutr@@ als at the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships which start in London on Friday , having met strict I@@ A@@ A@@ F criteria .
the head of the I@@ A@@ A@@ F &apos;s T@@ ask For@@ ce , R@@ un@@ e Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for re@@ insta@@ tement .
D@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ testing was still insufficient and banned co@@ ac@@ hes were still operating freely , he told re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation to the I@@ A@@ A@@ F Council .
production company disappointed with the poor success of T@@ om of Finland
Y@@ le reports that T@@ om of Finland was not such a successful film as its production staff expected .
&quot; if we &apos;@@ re being honest , I &apos;@@ m disappointed , &quot; ad@@ m@@ its Ann@@ ika S@@ uc@@ ks@@ dor@@ ff , C@@ E@@ O of Helsinki F@@ il@@ m , the film &apos;s production company , to Y@@ le .
&quot; I was afraid that Finnish audi@@ ences may be too con@@ serva@@ tive , and it seems that I was right . &quot;
the film premi@@ ered in February 20@@ 17 .
by the end of June , it had only had a little more than 1@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 view@@ ers , a very low figure compared with the film &apos;s budget of EUR 5 million .
&quot; this was no j@@ ac@@ k@@ po@@ t , but it &apos;s important that investors get their money back ,
which they already would &apos;@@ ve done if the film had done any better in Finland .
now , we need to wait for small re@@ turns from abroad , &quot; S@@ uc@@ ks@@ dor@@ ff says .
T@@ om of Finland was directed by D@@ ome Kar@@ u@@ k@@ os@@ ki .
how so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s financial rules impact Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
rules aimed at preventing un@@ f@@ et@@ te@@ red spending by European so@@ cc@@ er clu@@ bs will not dis@@ rupt Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ record transfer from Spain &apos;s Barcelona to France &apos;s Par@@ is@@ -@@ S@@ ain@@ t Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come further down the line for Paris S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main from U@@ E@@ F@@ A , the governing body over@@ seeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Cha@@ mp@@ ions L@@ eag@@ ue t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
financial F@@ air play rules launched by U@@ E@@ F@@ A in 20@@ 11 mean that P@@ S@@ G will eventually have to show that Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s transfer was funded without inc@@ urr@@ ing huge losses .
Barcelona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 2@@ 62 million ) just to buy the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian out of his contract and Ne@@ y@@ mar will comm@@ and a salary that will run to tens of millions of doll@@ ars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
P@@ S@@ G can certainly stu@@ mp up the cash to sign Ne@@ y@@ mar and add him to a g@@ ala@@ x@@ y of other star@@ s , given the team &apos;s funding from the ener@@ gy@@ -@@ rich ruling family of Qa@@ tar .
clu@@ bs are allowed to spend heavily on acqu@@ iring players but they have to counter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach break@@ -@@ even on their foot@@ ball@@ -@@ related business .
F@@ F@@ P was conc@@ eived by Michel P@@ la@@ tini after his election as U@@ E@@ F@@ A president in 2007 .
the former France pla@@ yer believed that clu@@ bs who ran up huge deb@@ ts in their pursuit of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king ru@@ in if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 20@@ 11 , F@@ F@@ P shif@@ ted from focusing on clu@@ bs &apos; deb@@ ts to monitoring their losses instead .
the change meant that the business model R@@ om@@ an A@@ bra@@ m@@ ov@@ ich initially used at C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - buy a clu@@ b with potential , and then spend heavily to improve the squ@@ ad and build a global br@@ and - become a tou@@ gh@@ er propos@@ ition .
during the current thre@@ e@@ -@@ year F@@ F@@ P assessment period that runs through 20@@ 18 , clu@@ bs can inc@@ ur losses of 30 million euros .
and despite P@@ la@@ tini being ous@@ ted in disgra@@ ce from the presidency in 20@@ 15 , his U@@ E@@ F@@ A success@@ or A@@ le@@ ks@@ an@@ der C@@ e@@ fer@@ in is still committed to de@@ terr@@ ing excessive spending .
&quot; certainly F@@ F@@ P is not dead and we will , for sure , reinforce the rules going forward , &quot; An@@ dre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ sees F@@ F@@ P at U@@ E@@ F@@ A , told The As@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress last week .
although P@@ S@@ G will have paid Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s bu@@ y@@ out clause in one lu@@ mp sum , it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal , so the transfer fe@@ e could be shown as a 4@@ 4@@ .@@ 4 mill@@ ion@@ -@@ euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years .
the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 20@@ 14 saw P@@ S@@ G , along with Ab@@ u D@@ ha@@ bi@@ -@@ ow@@ ned Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter C@@ ity , hit with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
P@@ S@@ G was handed a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and or@@ dered to limit its Cha@@ mp@@ ions L@@ eag@@ ue squ@@ ads to 21 players for the 20@@ 14@@ -@@ 15 se@@ as@@ on instead of the normal 25 .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A is on the loo@@ k@@ out for clu@@ bs who might try to ou@@ tw@@ it its financial regula@@ tors by inf@@ lating their income through companies linked to a clu@@ b &apos;s owners .
while a Qa@@ tar@@ i company could spon@@ s@@ or P@@ S@@ G , if the value of the spon@@ sor@@ ship was deemed to exceed standard market rates U@@ E@@ F@@ A would not allow it to count as legitimate income .
that is what happened in 20@@ 14 when U@@ E@@ F@@ A rul@@ ed that the value of the Qa@@ tar Tourism Authority spon@@ sor@@ ship of P@@ S@@ G was inf@@ lated .
it has been reported that part of Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s P@@ S@@ G ear@@ nings could come via payments from the 20@@ 22 World C@@ up organ@@ iz@@ ing committee in Qa@@ tar .
but P@@ S@@ G and Qa@@ tar 20@@ 22 have denied that Ne@@ y@@ mar will become a World C@@ up amb@@ assa@@ dor and such a man@@ eu@@ ver would be easy for U@@ E@@ F@@ A &apos;s regula@@ tors to ex@@ pose .
past sanctions sla@@ pped on P@@ S@@ G means that U@@ E@@ F@@ A will be even more wat@@ ch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A has not been in pre@@ -@@ emp@@ tive discussions with P@@ S@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s transfer , people familiar with the situation said Thursday .
they spoke to The As@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress on condition of an@@ ony@@ m@@ ity as they were not author@@ iz@@ ed to discuss the P@@ S@@ G situation .
the last published accounts show that P@@ S@@ G made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 20@@ 15@@ -@@ 16 on a tur@@ no@@ ver of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
P@@ S@@ G ex@@ pects Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s arri@@ val to be a bo@@ on for spon@@ sor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and j@@ er@@ se@@ y sales .
the clu@@ b ex@@ pects tur@@ no@@ ver would grow by at least 30 per@@ cent on the back of the signing .
clearly ir@@ ri@@ ta@@ ted to see one of so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s biggest players leaving , the Spanish le@@ ag@@ ue tried to sty@@ mi@@ e Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move , claim@@ ing that P@@ S@@ G will be b@@ reaching F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &apos; financial dop@@ ing &apos; , with the clu@@ b and the state , &quot; L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a President J@@ avi@@ er T@@ eb@@ as told Spanish newspaper as , referring to Qa@@ tar &apos;s ultimate ownership of P@@ S@@ G .
ar@@ sen@@ al manag@@ er Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ eng@@ er , whose clu@@ b is ow@@ ned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a &apos;s reservations about a state funding a clu@@ b .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ow@@ ner@@ ships and that has completely changed the whole land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of football in the last 15 years , &quot; W@@ eng@@ er said Thursday .
&quot; once a country ow@@ ns a clu@@ b , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial F@@ air play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big pla@@ yer to represent a country . &quot;
h@@ urr@@ y up : co@@ ach of Finnish World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships a@@ th@@ le@@ tes stu@@ ck in Helsinki

K@@ ris@@ ti@@ ina M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä may have to compete without hearing the advice of her co@@ ach .
P@@ aj@@ u@@ la@@ h@@ ti will compete in the long ju@@ mp quali@@ fication tomorrow and M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä in the tri@@ ple ju@@ mp quali@@ fication on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
their co@@ ach , Armen@@ ian G@@ haz@@ ar@@ y@@ an , has not obtained a visa for the UK .
G@@ haz@@ ar@@ y@@ an has visited the British E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y to take care of the matter , but to no avai@@ l .
the co@@ ach has an invitation sent by the organis@@ ers of the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , but it has not been enough to get a visa .
&quot; I don &apos;@@ t know if this is the first sy@@ mp@@ tom of Bre@@ x@@ it or what , &quot; team leader J@@ or@@ ma K@@ emp@@ pa@@ inen said .
&quot; he has always obtained a visa with success , but this time there &apos;s a problem .
he &apos;s doing everything he can to make it to London . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ ar@@ y@@ an has worked at the Finnish Ath@@ le@@ tics Federation for years .
&quot; it &apos;s not that important ,

me@@ d@@ al for Finland from World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in London like a mi@@ rac@@ le
the I@@ A@@ A@@ F World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in London will start this Friday , ending after a little more than a week on S@@ un@@ day 13 August .
Finnish audi@@ ences are pas@@ sion@@ ate about a@@ th@@ le@@ tics , cros@@ s@@ -@@ country ski@@ ing and ice ho@@ c@@ key and follow them fai@@ th@@ fully year after year , through th@@ ick and th@@ in .
sports f@@ ans measure success by the number of me@@ d@@ als won .
however , there are other indicators as well .
less attention is paid to the wonderful stor@@ ies of young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes who gain experience by going from one competition to the next to raise their performance up to a level where they can have a true chance of w@@ inning a me@@ d@@ al in open compet@@ itions .
this time , the no@@ t@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ big T@@ e@@ am Finland does not have such young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , or any ve@@ ter@@ ans for that matter .
w@@ inning a me@@ d@@ al would be a mi@@ rac@@ le .
luc@@ kil@@ y , nearly anything can happen in sports .
sports draw audi@@ ences in front of their television sets to watch different events , even though this year &apos;s fin@@ als will be held late at night due to the time difference between London and Finland .
at the previous I@@ A@@ A@@ F World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in 20@@ 15 , Finland won one br@@ on@@ ze me@@ d@@ al
by T@@ ero P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki in ja@@ vel@@ in .
the most hope@@ ful ones are expec@@ ting P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki to bring home another me@@ d@@ al , even though the results of P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki and other thro@@ w@@ ers , as well as his elimin@@ ation from the fin@@ als in European Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships last summer , say otherwise .
no matter what happens in this competition , P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki will remain in history as one of the great Finnish sports her@@ o@@ es .
for other Finnish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , reaching the fin@@ als or making a personal best would be a good result .
the success of our young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in international compet@@ itions , also this summer , gives us hope that Finnish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have a realistic chance of w@@ inning a me@@ d@@ al in future compet@@ itions .
growing young tal@@ ents and supporting them financially is more important that maintaining a small el@@ ite group of top a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
success takes years of hard work from a@@ th@@ le@@ tes and pati@@ ence from co@@ ac@@ hes and f@@ ans .
Finnish sports f@@ ans also respect international sports star@@ s and enjoy their incredi@@ ble results .
hopefully , the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in London remain in history because of U@@ sa@@ in b@@ ol@@ t and M@@ o F@@ ar@@ ah , not because of terrorism or co@@ war@@ dly attacks .
E@@ n@@ n@@ i Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i second in big air in c@@ opp@@ er M@@ oun@@ tain - &quot; I@@ t was so close &quot;
S@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der E@@ n@@ n@@ i Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i finished second in big air in a World C@@ up competition in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o .
this second place in c@@ opp@@ er M@@ oun@@ tain is Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i &apos;s best result in big air in the World C@@ up .
the competition was won by J@@ a@@ mi@@ e Ander@@ son from the USA .
Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i sco@@ red 14@@ 7 points .
on her last ju@@ mp , she attempted c@@ ab@@ aller@@ ial 10@@ 80 for the first time in a competition , and very nearly made it .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m feeling good right now , but I &apos;@@ m also a little anno@@ yed because the last ju@@ mp was so close .
but I will try it again in other compet@@ itions , &quot; Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i said .
in big air , compet@@ itors perform tric@@ ks after launching off very large ju@@ mps .
V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine &apos;s new fast ship stu@@ ck in port in Helsinki
V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine &apos;s new fast ship F@@ ST@@ R is badly behind sche@@ dule .
the ship was set to de@@ part from Helsinki to T@@ all@@ in@@ n at 6 p@@ m .
the ship was still being lo@@ aded at 8 p@@ m .
it arrived in Helsinki behind sche@@ dule .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been waiting for at least an hour and a half to get on board .
now , the line of cars is moving slowly , &quot; said J@@ o@@ han@@ n@@ es Re@@ ban@@ e from E@@ st@@ onia waiting for embar@@ ka@@ tion at the Por@@ t of Helsinki at 7 : 30 p@@ m .
Re@@ ban@@ e sus@@ pected that the new ship suffered from a technical fault .
Re@@ ban@@ e said that employees of the shipping company had provided those waiting for embar@@ ka@@ tion in their cars with water bot@@ t@@ les .
Ch@@ r@@ ista Grön@@ l@@ und , press manag@@ er of V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine , said to is that the ship had a technical fault .
however , it was re@@ pa@@ ired at the Por@@ t of Helsinki .
the ship will de@@ part from Helsinki a few hours behind sche@@ dule .
Grön@@ l@@ und said that the ship will also be a few hours late when returning from T@@ all@@ in@@ n .
the ship was set to return from T@@ all@@ in@@ n to Helsinki at 8 : 15 p@@ m .

from M@@ ä@@ l@@ ki@@ ä , the transport will head to the Por@@ t of Mus@@ tol@@ a along road 13 .
nos@@ tal@@ gi@@ a goes nic@@ he in &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Summ@@ er &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de dete@@ c@@ tive &quot;
so this ite@@ ration of the story is simultane@@ ously nos@@ tal@@ gic for the char@@ ac@@ ters &apos; &apos; 8@@ 0s g@@ l@@ ory days ; for the &apos; 9@@ 0s g@@ run@@ ge era ( around when the mas@@ termin@@ ds David W@@ a@@ in and Mic@@ ha@@ el S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter made the s@@ ket@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) ; and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its star@@ s , like E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h Ban@@ ks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and P@@ aul R@@ ud@@ d , went on to big@@ ger things .
as a cultural ar@@ ti@@ fact , it &apos;s both a s@@ end@@ up and em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of our F@@ ace@@ boo@@ k@@ -@@ enabled era of permanent re@@ minis@@ c@@ ence .
but as a fran@@ ch@@ ise , it feels like it &apos;s running out of time .
&quot; first D@@ ay of Cam@@ p &quot; worked surpris@@ ingly well , not just because of its absur@@ dis@@ t hu@@ m@@ or ( it included an origin story for a talking can of vege@@ tables , vo@@ ic@@ ed by H@@ . J@@ on B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in ) .
by doub@@ ling down on the core ga@@ g - mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age actors playing hor@@ n@@ y kid@@ s coming of age - it made the im@@ possibility of rec@@ ap@@ turing the past part of the jo@@ ke .
&quot; ten Y@@ e@@ ars later , &quot; with its adul@@ ts now playing adul@@ ts , is less emo@@ tionally ro@@ oted and its par@@ ody more sc@@ at@@ ter@@ sh@@ ot , including a ri@@ ff on &apos; 9@@ 0s s@@ tal@@ ker flic@@ ks like &quot; The H@@ and Th@@ at ro@@ cks the cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point a character ru@@ mma@@ ges through an ap@@ ple Pow@@ er@@ book , some in@@ -@@ line s@@ ka@@ tes and &quot; a bun@@ ch of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the core stor@@ ies are the same .
S@@ we@@ et@@ -@@ hear@@ ted Co@@ op ( M@@ r@@ . S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter ) , now a no@@ vel@@ ist , still has@@ n &apos;@@ t g@@ ot@@ ten over K@@ ati@@ e ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ rea@@ u ) .
vic@@ tor ( K@@ en Mar@@ ino ) still has@@ n &apos;@@ t lost his vir@@ g@@ in@@ ity .
and there &apos;s another b@@ at@@ ti@@ ly vill@@ ain@@ ous p@@ lot involving R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an ( also M@@ r@@ . S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter ) , now ab@@ et@@ ted by Geor@@ ge H@@ . W@@ . Bush ( a w@@ ell@@ -@@ inhabi@@ ted impression by Mic@@ ha@@ el I@@ an B@@ lack ) .
as always , the best part of the fran@@ ch@@ ise is the di@@ gres@@ sions .
it &apos;s especially fu@@ n to see the fore@@ ver@@ -@@ young M@@ r@@ . R@@ ud@@ d , sporting M@@ at@@ t D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sou@@ l pat@@ ch from &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big@@ -@@ man@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ cam@@ p An@@ dy now feels like a ge@@ ez@@ er .
it &apos;s the mom@@ ents of ran@@ dom lun@@ acy that might power this fran@@ ch@@ ise on , like a kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive &quot; S@@ even U@@ p ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion : &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Summ@@ er : twenty Y@@ e@@ ars later , &quot; whose last sc@@ ene will have the gan@@ g going to see the mo@@ vi@@ e premi@@ er@@ e of &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Summ@@ er . &quot;
&quot; com@@ ra@@ de dete@@ c@@ tive &quot; on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , meanwhile , appe@@ als to a different br@@ and of nos@@ tal@@ gi@@ a : the C@@ old War revi@@ val@@ ism of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; A@@ tom@@ ic b@@ l@@ on@@ de &quot; and even &quot; g@@ low , &quot; with its East ver@@ sus West w@@ res@@ t@@ ling ic@@ on@@ o@@ graphy .
the com@@ edy , created by B@@ rian G@@ ate@@ wood and Al@@ es@@ san@@ dr@@ o T@@ an@@ a@@ ka , with R@@ hy@@ s Th@@ om@@ as direc@@ ting , pur@@ ports to be found TV : a Roman@@ ian 198@@ 0s bud@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ co@@ p dra@@ ma about two Bu@@ char@@ est officers fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the Mar@@ x@@ ist@@ -@@ L@@ en@@ inis@@ t way .
the lead ro@@ les - hard@@ -@@ bo@@ iled G@@ reg@@ or and ide@@ alis@@ tic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pi@@ er@@ si@@ c J@@ r@@ . and Cor@@ n@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , their dialogue du@@ b@@ bed in English by Chan@@ ning Ta@@ tum ( also an executive producer ) and Jos@@ ep@@ h G@@ ord@@ on@@ -@@ L@@ ev@@ it@@ t .
it &apos;s a bri@@ lli@@ ant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some fine sight g@@ ag@@ s ( the police pass the time wat@@ ching ch@@ ess on TV as Americans might football ) .
and the ros@@ ter of famous vo@@ ic@@ e@@ -@@ over actors - among them J@@ enn@@ y s@@ late , Nic@@ k O@@ ff@@ er@@ man , Ma@@ her@@ sh@@ ala Al@@ i and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a decent game of sp@@ ot@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ voice .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de dete@@ c@@ tive &quot; is so committed to the ver@@ is@@ im@@ il@@ it@@ ude of a ham@@ fis@@ ted propaganda dra@@ ma - a ki@@ ller we@@ aring a Re@@ ag@@ an m@@ ask is involved - that it often plays like one .
at six long ep@@ is@@ od@@ es , it dra@@ gs , and the com@@ edy is@@ n &apos;@@ t fast or frequent enough .
e@@ di@@ ted to a ti@@ ghter length , &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de dete@@ c@@ tive &quot; might deliver better on its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sa@@ ti@@ re , as when G@@ reg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y , whose lob@@ by is always occupied by two f@@ at men w@@ ol@@ f@@ ing down a p@@ ile of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message , for the imag@@ ined commun@@ ist audi@@ ence , is that Western culture can turn anything into f@@ od@@ der to bin@@ ge .
the fic@@ tional Roman@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history , and the@@ irs .
T@@ on@@ i Ta@@ ur@@ u from Kou@@ vol@@ a is ready to fight in Mac@@ au on Sa@@ tur@@ day - against a former U@@ F@@ C fi@@ ghter
T@@ on@@ i Ta@@ ur@@ u wants to keep the fight going .
T@@ on@@ i Ta@@ ur@@ u will face a tough op@@ pon@@ ent in Mac@@ a@@ o , as Le@@ an@@ dr@@ o I@@ s@@ sa from Bra@@ z@@ il fought in the ultimate Fi@@ ghting Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ship ( U@@ F@@ C ) last year .
the Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian also has a black bel@@ t in j@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u and he has won the World J@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ J@@ it@@ s@@ u Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships .
&quot; for once , I &apos;@@ m fighting an op@@ pon@@ ent who is older than me ,
and that &apos;@@ ll be fu@@ n , &quot; says Ta@@ ur@@ u , 32 .
originally , the fight was to be held in Indonesia last Sa@@ tur@@ day .
however , the event was cancell@@ ed due to log@@ is@@ tical problems , but three fi@@ ghts were quickly moved to Mac@@ au .
Ta@@ ur@@ u has never experienced anything like this before .
&quot; this was the first time my fight was cancell@@ ed .
it was anno@@ ying , as it took a lot of time training and preparation . &quot;
however , the fi@@ ghter was happy to see that the fight was res@@ che@@ d@@ ul@@ ed .
one week of waiting does not cause many changes in preparations .
&quot; this move do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t change my physical condition , as it can &apos;@@ t be much improved in a week .
however , it can get worse if I train too hard . &quot;
in some of his previous fi@@ ghts , Ta@@ ur@@ u has faced opponents whose streng@@ ths were in stand@@ -@@ up fighting .
this time it is a different story .
Ta@@ ur@@ u descri@@ bes I@@ s@@ sa as a typical Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian fi@@ ghter .
&quot; he &apos;s fairly aggres@@ sive .
my gu@@ ess is that he &apos;@@ ll come at me hard in the first round , trying to kno@@ ck me down .
he knows how to w@@ res@@ t@@ le . after all , he has won the World J@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ J@@ it@@ s@@ u Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships . &quot;
Ta@@ ur@@ u &apos;s last fight did not go according to plan .
K@@ ev@@ in Bel@@ ing@@ on from the P@@ hil@@ ip@@ p@@ ines lan@@ ded a n@@ as@@ ty b@@ low in the cor@@ ner of Ta@@ ur@@ u &apos;s eye and claimed the win .
&quot; it was my best fight , especially standing up : he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t land a single pun@@ ch .
when I tried to take him down , he hit me in the eye .
I felt bad about it for a long time . &quot;
new moti@@ vation
some fi@@ gh@@ ters have a few mat@@ ches a year , while some fight more frequently .
for example , I@@ s@@ sa &apos;s last fight was in September ,
while Ta@@ ur@@ u had three fi@@ ghts last year .
this will be the second fight of the year .
the pace has felt heavy at times .
&quot; in recent years , I &apos;@@ ve trained and been fit all the time .
however , I &apos;@@ ve only fought for the sake of fighting . &quot;
when the 3@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old heard about the up@@ coming fac@@ e@@ -@@ off , he felt that he needed a change of sc@@ ener@@ y .
&quot; I was training in Es@@ po@@ o and started to enjoy all of this again .
the inten@@ s@@ ity of training was really high , as there was also one fi@@ ghter from Sweden . &quot;
a good physical condition will be needed on Sa@@ tur@@ day when Ta@@ ur@@ u must be ready for a tough match .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve spar@@ red against opponents of the same size and trained stand@@ -@@ up fighting . &quot;
the 3@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old intends to stay standing .
&quot; I need to be s@@ mar@@ t when I strike .
if an opportunity presents itself , I must be ready to take it .
I can &apos;@@ t let him take me to the ground without a fight , as it consum@@ es the most energy . &quot;
Mac@@ au is an attractive location for Ta@@ ur@@ u who has also fought in China before .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve heard that it &apos;s the L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as of China .
I &apos;@@ m certain that it &apos;@@ ll be a great night . &quot;
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announ@@ ce later that interest rates will remain un@@ changed after la@@ c@@ kl@@ us@@ tre economic growth and eas@@ ing inflation da@@ mp@@ ened specu@@ lation over a h@@ ike .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; as it kept interest rates on hold a@@ mid a tigh@@ tening squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze on family incomes .
polic@@ y@@ makers on the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( M@@ P@@ C ) voted 6@@ -@@ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members this month calling for a rise as la@@ c@@ kl@@ us@@ tre economic growth has weaken@@ ed support for a h@@ ike .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.@@ 7 % in 20@@ 17 and 1.@@ 6 % in 20@@ 18 and cau@@ tioned the squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze on hou@@ se@@ hold incomes would continue , with inflation still expected to sur@@ ge close to 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ all@@ ed rate h@@ ik@@ es will be needed over the next few years to re@@ in in Bre@@ x@@ it@@ -@@ fu@@ ell@@ ed inflation and said bor@@ ro@@ wing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
Members also voted to withdraw part of the ma@@ mm@@ oth econom@@ y@@ -@@ bo@@ os@@ ting package un@@ le@@ as@@ hed a year ago in the after@@ ma@@ th of Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will call time on the Ter@@ m F@@ un@@ ding S@@ che@@ me to offer che@@ ap@@ -@@ finance to banks from next February , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 1@@ 15 billion .
in minutes of the rates decision , the Bank said : &quot; in the M@@ P@@ C &apos;s central forec@@ ast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish in the ne@@ ar@@ -@@ term as the squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze on hou@@ se@@ holds &apos; real incomes continues to wei@@ gh on consumption . &quot;
on rates , it reiterated that &quot; some tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to co@@ ol inflation and by a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ as@@ ting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 20@@ 20 .
but the Bank stressed that any h@@ ik@@ es would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s down@@ gra@@ ded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.@@ 9 % and 1.@@ 7 % predic@@ ted in May .
it maintained its forec@@ ast for growth of 1.@@ 8 % in 20@@ 18 .
ster@@ ling fel@@ l against the dollar and the euro following the news .
the p@@ ound was 0.@@ 5 % down at 1.@@ 31 US doll@@ ars and fel@@ l 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the no@@ -@@ change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have da@@ mp@@ ened moun@@ ting expectations of a h@@ ike , with GDP ed@@ ging up to 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter from 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months .
growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year , according to the Bank .
its latest inflation report offered little che@@ er for hou@@ se@@ holds being hit by so@@ aring inflation and pal@@ try pay ris@@ es as it said the squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze will get worse before it gets better .
it added that monetary policy &quot; cannot prevent &quot; the hit to incomes over the next few years , but ex@@ pects wages will rec@@ over &quot; significantly &quot; towards the end of its thre@@ e@@ -@@ year forec@@ ast .
the economy is also set for a boost from sur@@ ging demand for British goods thanks to the weak p@@ ound , which will off@@ set some of the lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ ck EU referendum vote , which sent the p@@ ound s@@ lu@@ mp@@ ing .
the Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s latest rates ver@@ dic@@ t , there had been growing cla@@ m@@ our for a rate rise as inflation ra@@ mp@@ ed up pressure on hard@@ -@@ pressed hou@@ se@@ holds , with three polic@@ y@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.@@ 5 % in July .
inflation e@@ ased back to 2.@@ 6 % last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months .
the Bank said the over@@ sho@@ ot relative to its 2 % target was &quot; entirely &quot; down to the weak p@@ ound .
An@@ drew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , direc@@ tor at Co@@ rec@@ o mor@@ t@@ g@@ age bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent fall in s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mor@@ t@@ g@@ age market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as l@@ end@@ ers cla@@ m@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fashion .
the market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re@@ -@@ mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages , many with fe@@ e@@ -@@ free options as well as low rates , become ever more popular . &quot;
N@@ H@@ S to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10@@ ,@@ 000
patients will be able to access a &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the N@@ H@@ S .
N@@ H@@ S England announced that pre@@ -@@ expos@@ ure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ EP ) , a p@@ ill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infec@@ tion in hi@@ gh@@ -@@ risk individuals by around 86 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial thre@@ e@@ -@@ year trial to an estimated 10@@ ,@@ 000 people .
it agreed to fund the trial after the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al up@@ held a High Court ruling last year , which said the N@@ H@@ S had the power to pay for Pr@@ EP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Thursday was ha@@ iled as a &apos; major new intervention &apos; by N@@ H@@ S England chi@@ ef executive S@@ im@@ on Steven@@ s while the National A@@ ids T@@ rust ( N@@ A@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pi@@ vo@@ tal moment &apos; .
sexual health c@@ lin@@ ics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ ol and S@@ he@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to start en@@ ro@@ lling people , with more c@@ lin@@ ics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 20@@ 18 .
P@@ re@@ -@@ expos@@ ure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ EP ) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV .
tri@@ als have shown Pr@@ EP significantly reduc@@ es HIV transmission among those at@@ -@@ risk of infec@@ tion .
taking Pr@@ EP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person &apos;s body to prevent an HIV infec@@ tion taking hold .
such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex .
those eligible for the treatment include ga@@ y or b@@ is@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and those with H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment .
c@@ lin@@ ics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ -@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people living and registered with a G@@ P in England will also be able to en@@ ro@@ l for potential participation at their local participating sexual health c@@ lin@@ ic .
the programme will cost £ 10 million and N@@ H@@ S England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the trial is designed to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by gather@@ ing c@@ lin@@ ical evidence on how it is targeted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
Mr Steven@@ s said : &apos; this major new intervention should complement and super@@ charge the w@@ ide@@ -@@ ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV .
it &apos;s another mil@@ es@@ tone in more than three decades &apos; worth of progress in tackling one of humanity &apos;s major health challenges . &apos;
De@@ bor@@ ah G@@ old , chi@@ ef executive at N@@ A@@ T ( National A@@ ids T@@ rust ) , said : &apos; this is a pi@@ vo@@ tal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted properly at those in need and at risk , offers the possibility of trans@@ forming the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September , people at high risk of HIV will have access via this N@@ H@@ S@@ -@@ funded trial in England to an em@@ power@@ ing new tool that is truly individu@@ ally controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &apos;
I@@ an Green , chi@@ ef executive of the Ter@@ r@@ ence H@@ ig@@ g@@ ins T@@ rust , said : &apos; the priority must now be to make sure that the trial is ro@@ lled out spe@@ ed@@ ily across the country , and that no@@ -@@ one at risk of HIV is left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP trial drug has been proc@@ u@@ red , we &apos;@@ re well on the way to protecting over 10@@ ,@@ 000 people at risk of HIV . &apos;
shadow public health minister Sharon H@@ od@@ g@@ son said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and long over@@ due after months of delays and he@@ el@@ -@@ dra@@ gging by the Government .
the evidence shows just how trans@@ forma@@ tive this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this li@@ fe@@ -@@ changing infec@@ tion .
this trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this trial is ro@@ lled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &apos;
living the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and cle@@ ver design tric@@ ks have trans@@ formed this small E@@ ar@@ ls Court fl@@ at into a sp@@ ac@@ ious home
J@@ o@@ an@@ ne L@@ ei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a pas@@ sion for doing up property , down@@ sized from a large home in K@@ ni@@ ght@@ s@@ bridge to an E@@ ar@@ ls Court a@@ part@@ ment in 20@@ 14 .
it is on the first floor of a s@@ mar@@ t Qu@@ een A@@ nne ter@@ race - and it is a te@@ sta@@ ment to the new design that J@@ o@@ an@@ ne has@@ n &apos;@@ t pac@@ ked her b@@ ag@@ s and sold on .
&quot; before this , I was living with my ex in K@@ ni@@ ght@@ s@@ bridge in a much big@@ ger space , &quot; J@@ o@@ an@@ ne says .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable for my price .
I was shown this a@@ part@@ ment in E@@ ar@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fel@@ l in love with it and put an offer in that day . &quot;
since the first vie@@ wing , the 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ s@@ q ft fl@@ at has had a complete over@@ hau@@ l .
originally a one@@ -@@ b@@ ed@@ room property with a con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted la@@ y@@ out - you had to wal@@ k through the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en to get to the b@@ ed@@ room - J@@ o@@ an@@ ne wanted to add storage space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the generous ceiling he@@ ight .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big win@@ do@@ ws , lo@@ ts of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she employed Er@@ f@@ an Az@@ ad@@ i of N@@ ot@@ ting H@@ ill@@ -@@ based archite@@ cture and design stu@@ di@@ o D@@ uc@@ k &amp; S@@ hed to exploit the 12@@ .@@ 5@@ ft ceilings and create a home that was@@ n &apos;@@ t only a development but a place for J@@ o@@ an@@ ne to live .
the ceiling was@@ n &apos;@@ t quite tal@@ l enough to add two sp@@ ac@@ es on top of each other so the archite@@ c@@ tural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
Er@@ f@@ an had to think cre@@ ati@@ vely to resolve the brief .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he expla@@ ins .
&quot; we had to arran@@ ge the sp@@ ac@@ es so that they sta@@ cked on top of each other without ne@@ eding to hun@@ ch down .
it was@@ n &apos;@@ t just building a simple plat@@ form , but c@@ ran@@ king the ste@@ els so that they were at the right he@@ ight for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ f@@ an to get two fu@@ ll@@ -@@ he@@ ight ro@@ oms on top of each other in the space - with lo@@ ts of added dra@@ ma .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a v@@ in@@ tage c@@ opp@@ er light win@@ dow from R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gla@@ mo@@ ro@@ us living area below .
mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red g@@ old fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure , sil@@ ver acc@@ ents and v@@ in@@ tage Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ i@@ lle li@@ ghting all set the sty@@ le for the scheme .
the use of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ rs plays a part in adding the@@ at@@ re , space and light .
a short cor@@ rid@@ or is mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red s@@ pl@@ ash@@ back feels like a win@@ dow to another room .
at the entr@@ ance , mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red units provide storage for all J@@ o@@ an@@ ne &apos;s cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery and g@@ l@@ ass@@ w@@ are .
giving the perc@@ eption of a more gla@@ mo@@ ro@@ us space , the be@@ au@@ ty of the living room is being able to close off the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en when it &apos;s not in use .
F@@ ol@@ da@@ way k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens are nothing new .
what &apos;s unique about this one is that it &apos;s a gar@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ sty@@ le lif@@ t@@ -@@ up door .
&quot; a bit of engine@@ ering went into that , &quot; expla@@ ins Er@@ f@@ an of the ste@@ el@@ -@@ reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered M@@ D@@ F door .
&quot; it &apos;s counter@@ -@@ wei@@ ghted so that when you push the door up , it g@@ l@@ ides really easily . &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver use of space and storage , J@@ o@@ an@@ ne gained an additional 1@@ 6@@ s@@ q m , an extra b@@ ed@@ room and an improved la@@ y@@ out .
&quot; at the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valu@@ ed , &quot; Er@@ f@@ an says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real es@@ ta@@ te ag@@ ent will wal@@ k in and do a calcu@@ lation based on floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its lu@@ x@@ uri@@ ous ed@@ ge .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emo@@ tional b@@ ond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ f@@ an .
&quot; you don &apos;@@ t fall in love with the elec@@ tr@@ ical fe@@ eds in the w@@ all@@ s .
these are important but they don &apos;@@ t pul@@ l the heart str@@ ings . &quot;
it goes to show that through good design and increased squ@@ are met@@ re@@ age , a fl@@ at can turn from something standard into something quite ama@@ z@@ ing .
in fact , like J@@ o@@ an@@ ne , you may choose not to leave .

S@@ of@@ ia looked radi@@ ant in her fresh summer look .
S@@ of@@ ia even entered into a conver@@ sa@@ tion with p@@ ho@@ to@@ graph@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m just holding my tu@@ mm@@ y , &quot; S@@ of@@ ia said lau@@ gh@@ ing in reference to her approac@@ hing due date .
she teac@@ hes us with s@@ we@@ et ch@@ ill@@ i
in summer 1996 , a bo@@ oth was set up in the La@@ h@@ ti market squ@@ are selling T@@ ha@@ i food .
those living in La@@ h@@ ti d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the courage to have a tas@@ te , they simply wal@@ ked by .
the bo@@ oth was set up by P@@ an@@ y@@ a Su@@ am@@ s@@ ri@@ -@@ P@@ ent@@ til@@ ä , or P@@ an@@ ja to those who knows her .
she bar@@ ely spoke Finnish , and the T@@ ha@@ i language was@@ n &apos;@@ t widely spoken in Finland at the time .
because people d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the courage to go and e@@ at , P@@ an@@ ja offered free bi@@ tes .
and so she tau@@ ght everyone living in La@@ h@@ ti how to e@@ at T@@ ha@@ i food , one spring ro@@ ll at a time .
&quot; go on , tas@@ te it , tas@@ te it , &quot; she said .
I was immediately ho@@ o@@ ked .
I used to go more often , eventually every day .
in summer 1997 , P@@ an@@ ja opened a T@@ ha@@ i res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in the La@@ h@@ ti market h@@ all .
it consis@@ ted of two small tables , with room for no more than 20 customers .
not only did she te@@ ach us to e@@ at T@@ ha@@ i food , but also to sit next to str@@ ang@@ ers .
when you &apos;@@ re hun@@ g@@ ry and not many seats are available , you can &apos;@@ t leave an empty seat between yourself and a str@@ ang@@ er .
slowly , we got to know each other better and became friends .
finally , I s@@ at there e@@ ating , reading a dic@@ tionary and trying to learn the T@@ ha@@ i language .
the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant oper@@ ated in the market h@@ all for two years , after which it had to move because it was said that the ar@@ om@@ as from P@@ an@@ ja &apos;s hom@@ e@@ made curr@@ y pas@@ tes were too intense .
a new spo@@ t became available at the end of the market h@@ all ,
with more space .
now we can be g@@ ru@@ mp@@ y at our own tables . only during the bu@@ si@@ est hours do we need to ti@@ mid@@ ly ask str@@ ang@@ ers whether the seat next to them is available .
P@@ an@@ ja knows her customers .
we tell her how we are doing , where we have been and who we have seen .
she knows what each of us e@@ ats .
she has seen how her customers pass from one situation on to the next and how their d@@ inner com@@ pan@@ ions change .
she re@@ members the name of the man with whom I had my first spring ro@@ lls .
she re@@ members when I was s@@ k@@ inn@@ y and when I was f@@ at , and she knows what I was like when I was youn@@ ger .
it &apos;s n@@ ice to have lun@@ ch after everyone else , take a seat in my own place next to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en door and talk this and that with P@@ an@@ ja who is le@@ an@@ ing on the b@@ ar .
food is@@ n &apos;@@ t the most important thing she has given us .
she has tau@@ ght us tolerance and given us a world view , served with s@@ we@@ et ch@@ ill@@ i .
in addition to our sense of tas@@ te , she has opened up our hear@@ ts and minds .
now , many speak to her in T@@ ha@@ i - thanks to more extensive travel opportunities .
I admi@@ re P@@ an@@ ja .
she &apos;s always friendly , even though she too has faced tough times .
she works hard .
in addition to her days in the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , she enjo@@ ys pic@@ king mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms and bil@@ ber@@ ries .
last week , we qui@@ et@@ ly celeb@@ rated the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant .
P@@ an@@ ja served us customers stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry ca@@ ke for d@@ ess@@ ert .
there was no f@@ us@@ s or big noise to mark the event ; it was just another day at work .
discovered under@@ ground base revealed 17@@ 3 IS@@ IS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
earlier this year , security authorities got their hands on a significant list considering the battle against terrorism .
the list contains information about more than 1@@ 70 IS@@ IS terrorists who are ready to attack in Europe .
according to German Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , there are 17@@ 3 listed persons in total , and the list includes personal details and p@@ ho@@ tos of each individual .
of the listed persons , 1@@ 30 come from Iraq , but there are also six Europeans
from Belgium , the Netherlands , France and Germany .

according to Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , special forces of the Iraqi army found the list , containing personal details and p@@ ho@@ tos of terrorists , as they were going through an under@@ ground base of IS@@ IS in Mos@@ u@@ l .
us intelligence authorities examined the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the documents and for@@ war@@ ded them to Inter@@ po@@ l .
Inter@@ po@@ l distributed the list to the security authorities of all European countries in May .
there were fears that terrorists were planning something large and serious in the west , as IS@@ IS was taken down in the Middle East .
according to Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , the list contains the names and p@@ ho@@ tos of all listed persons , as well as their dates of birth , ali@@ ases and information about their home country .
the list also speci@@ fies the speci@@ al@@ ty of each terrorist .
for example , the ali@@ as of S@@ am@@ i J@@ . , a 2@@ 7@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old from Germany , is Ab@@ u As@@ si@@ d al@@ -@@ Al@@ man@@ i , or the German .
the list says that he left Germany in 20@@ 12 , going first to Egypt , followed by Li@@ by@@ a and Turkey , before he went to Syria to join IS@@ IS .
next to his p@@ ho@@ to , suicide bom@@ ber is written as his speci@@ al@@ ty .
it is not known what has happened to him .
rou@@ gh@@ ly 6@@ ,@@ 000 fi@@ gh@@ ters , whose des@@ tiny is un@@ known , have left Europe to join IS@@ IS .

bro@@ thers fight over $ 500 million property emp@@ ire
two bro@@ thers are at war over one of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s biggest real es@@ ta@@ te em@@ pi@@ res , worth more than $ 500 million , four decades after their Italian family founded the d@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty .
former Car@@ l@@ ton F@@ o@@ ot@@ ball C@@ lu@@ b direc@@ tor and develop@@ er C@@ ol@@ in De Lu@@ ti@@ s lives in a To@@ or@@ ak man@@ sion three doors from youn@@ ger bro@@ ther P@@ aul , who has taken him to the Su@@ pre@@ me Court over how their property and business assets will be s@@ lic@@ ed up .
P@@ aul has wanted out of the family business since 20@@ 14 but an ac@@ r@@ im@@ on@@ ious argument is playing out in the Su@@ pre@@ me Court over the break@@ -@@ up .
together with their mother Ann@@ a the bro@@ thers own 38 pro@@ per@@ ties worth more than half a billion doll@@ ars , am@@ ass@@ ed since the family b@@ ought a S@@ mit@@ h S@@ tre@@ et , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , sh@@ op in 19@@ 73 .
there , the family founded W@@ es@@ t@@ co je@@ ans and gre@@ w it into a chain of 1@@ 60 re@@ ta@@ il out@@ l@@ ets .
it sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
that money was sun@@ k into property and the De Lu@@ ti@@ s port@@ fol@@ io now includes city offices , Br@@ un@@ sw@@ ick and S@@ or@@ ren@@ to development sites , G@@ old Co@@ ast and M@@ t Bu@@ ller a@@ part@@ ments , and sub@@ urban sh@@ opp@@ ing centres .
under an agreement with their late fa@@ ther , C@@ ol@@ in - described by P@@ aul as &quot; the major driving force and the dominant person@@ ality &quot; in the De Lu@@ ti@@ s family - ow@@ ns about tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of the company assets and P@@ aul about one@@ -@@ third .
a court fil@@ ing says this trans@@ lates to C@@ ol@@ in ow@@ ning property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and P@@ aul $ 17@@ 6 million .
divid@@ ing the pro@@ per@@ ties and cash has proved the stic@@ king point for P@@ aul .
&quot; the s@@ pl@@ its proposed by C@@ ol@@ in left him with what I considered to be the best pro@@ per@@ ties , &quot; he wrote in an initial court aff@@ id@@ avi@@ t in 20@@ 15 .
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first Su@@ pre@@ me Court hearing was held .
the bro@@ thers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which P@@ aul alle@@ ges C@@ ol@@ in has loc@@ ked him out of .
C@@ ol@@ in argu@@ es this is not true , but acc@@ uses P@@ aul of in@@ compe@@ ten@@ tly managing some pro@@ per@@ ties .
in an early aff@@ id@@ avi@@ t f@@ iled by C@@ ol@@ in , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage dicta@@ tes that family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
costs are moun@@ ting in the case , with hundreds of pa@@ ges of aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e@@ ma@@ ils and reports by companies including D@@ elo@@ it@@ te , P@@ it@@ ch@@ er Par@@ t@@ ners and Charter K@@ ec@@ k C@@ ra@@ mer f@@ iled and top bar@@ ris@@ ters including A@@ ll@@ an M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and senior sol@@ ic@@ itors retained by both sides .
M@@ s De Lu@@ ti@@ s and her late h@@ us@@ b@@ and Lu@@ ig@@ i were Italian immigrants who ran milk b@@ ars and del@@ ic@@ ate@@ s@@ s@@ ens from the late 19@@ 5@@ 0s and in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s b@@ ought a sh@@ op in Br@@ un@@ sw@@ ick .
they used the coll@@ ate@@ ral to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where C@@ ol@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans stor@@ e .
C@@ ol@@ in says he started W@@ es@@ t@@ co there when he was &quot; in my final years of high school , when P@@ aul was a young child ( around 10 years old ) . &quot;
Ann@@ a De Lu@@ ti@@ s says she and Lu@@ ig@@ i , who died in 20@@ 12 , hoped to pass down their pro@@ per@@ ties to their s@@ ons am@@ ic@@ ably .
&quot; Lu@@ ig@@ i often said to me that he never wanted the bro@@ thers to end up in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other bro@@ thers , Mar@@ k and Lu@@ ke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ ti@@ s group of companies , with C@@ ol@@ in saying that Mar@@ k was paid $ 10 million when he left the business , and Lu@@ ke $ 26 million .
both Lu@@ ke and Mar@@ k had become , P@@ aul says , &quot; b@@ itte@@ r about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
C@@ ol@@ in has kept a low profile despite being a former AF@@ L clu@@ b board member and , according to a 20@@ 15 bio@@ graphy of E@@ d@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the television sta@@ r &apos;s best friend .
F@@ air@@ fa@@ x Media contac@@ ted C@@ ol@@ in and P@@ aul De Lu@@ ti@@ s on Friday , and their lawyers .
only C@@ ol@@ in replied , by text message , to say that because the case was before the courts &quot; I really cannot say much . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my bro@@ ther P@@ aul has chosen to su@@ e me and dra@@ g our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid@@ -@@ 20@@ 16 , C@@ ol@@ in wrote in one court fil@@ ing that he had tried to accommo@@ date his bro@@ ther &apos;s requests .
&quot; our fa@@ ther would not have wanted to see P@@ aul and I end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he was &quot; still hope@@ ful of resolution . &quot;
on Friday , that hope appeared gone .
&quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; C@@ ol@@ in wrote .
tru@@ mp &apos;s new chi@@ ef of staff plans to restrict the president &apos;s media di@@ et .
others have tried and failed .
maybe J@@ oh@@ n F@@ . K@@ ell@@ y can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
politic@@ o reports that the new White House chi@@ ef of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President tru@@ mp - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the b@@ os@@ s on a more even ke@@ el .
here &apos;s a bit from re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y :
&quot; when new White House Chi@@ ef of Sta@@ ff J@@ oh@@ n F@@ . K@@ ell@@ y hu@@ d@@ d@@ led with senior staff on his first day at work , he outlined a key problem in President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp &apos;s White House that he planned to fi@@ x : bad information getting into the president &apos;s hands .
K@@ ell@@ y told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs - because the president would make better decisions if given good information . &quot;
K@@ ell@@ y &apos;s diag@@ no@@ sis makes perfect sense , but others have tried and failed to ta@@ me tru@@ mp by monitoring his media di@@ et .
President tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he &apos;s in the White House , his T@@ V@@ -@@ wat@@ ching ha@@ bit is still going strong .
&quot; if candidate tru@@ mp was up@@ set about unfair cover@@ age , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair cover@@ age from out@@ l@@ ets that were persu@@ ad@@ able , &quot; S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaign advis@@ er , told Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o in February .
politic@@ o &apos;s T@@ ar@@ a Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping tru@@ mp &apos;s T@@ wit@@ ter ha@@ bit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stead@@ y stre@@ am of praise . &quot;
o@@ ka@@ y .
but the idea that tru@@ mp &apos;s T@@ wit@@ ter ha@@ bit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is la@@ ug@@ ha@@ ble .
maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don &apos;@@ t - that tru@@ mp &apos;s tw@@ e@@ ets would have been even more inf@@ la@@ mma@@ tory if not for their interventions .
we &apos;@@ ll probably never know about tw@@ e@@ ets that tru@@ mp d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t send .
if his sta@@ ffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times , then their efforts were worthwhile .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent tru@@ mp from sti@@ r@@ ring up contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that in a White House com@@ posed of compet@@ ing fac@@ tions , people in@@ vari@@ ably try to advance their ag@@ end@@ as by presenting tru@@ mp with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their wor@@ l@@ d@@ views .
politic@@ o - all over this story - reported in May on advis@@ ers &apos; pen@@ chan@@ ts for stra@@ te@@ g@@ ically feeding du@@ b@@ ious information to the president .
this was one example , described by re@@ por@@ ter S@@ han@@ e G@@ ol@@ d@@ mach@@ er :
&quot; current and former tru@@ mp officials say tru@@ mp can react vol@@ can@@ ically to negative press cli@@ ps , especially those with damaging lea@@ ks , becoming en@@ gro@@ s@@ sed in finding out where they origin@@ ated .
that is what happened in late February when someone mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ously gave the president a prin@@ ted cop@@ y of an article from G@@ ot@@ Ne@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m , the web@@ site of Internet pro@@ voca@@ teur Char@@ les C@@ . J@@ oh@@ n@@ son , which accused de@@ pu@@ ty chi@@ ef of staff K@@ ati@@ e Wal@@ sh of being &apos; the source behind a bun@@ ch of lea@@ ks &apos; in the White House .
no matter that J@@ oh@@ n@@ son had been perman@@ ently banned from T@@ wit@@ ter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lob@@ bed false accus@@ ations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .

the incredi@@ ble transfer fe@@ e of EUR 2@@ 22 million is the highest fe@@ e ever paid in the history of football .
the earlier record was held by Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United which paid EUR 10@@ 5 million for French P@@ aul P@@ og@@ ba last summer .

B@@ es@@ t@@ selling author R@@ ai@@ ja O@@ ran@@ en , famous for Finnish TV series Ru@@ us@@ un a@@ ik@@ a and P@@ uh@@ ta@@ at val@@ ke@@ at la@@ k@@ an@@ at , recently celeb@@ rated her 6@@ 9@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
H@@ y@@ p@@ no@@ sis helped R@@ ai@@ ja O@@ ran@@ en .
her five gran@@ d@@ children , together with writing , keep the gran@@ d@@ mother so bus@@ y that R@@ ai@@ ja and her h@@ us@@ b@@ and J@@ yr@@ ki decided to give up the Spanish su@@ n and their a@@ part@@ ment in Fu@@ en@@ gi@@ ro@@ la after 18 w@@ inter@@ s .
first , they sold their house , and this spring they termin@@ ated their le@@ ase agreement .
originally , R@@ ai@@ ja was driven to the light and su@@ n by her de@@ pression and alco@@ hol@@ ism which she has subsequently be@@ a@@ ten .
she is also 20 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms li@@ ghter .
&quot; my weight started to drop when I stopped e@@ ating ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in for my de@@ pression .
I got help for my alco@@ hol@@ ism from hy@@ p@@ no@@ sis which also helped me to be@@ at my fear of flying .
I ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t had a drin@@ k in 15 years .

R@@ ai@@ ja and J@@ yr@@ ki O@@ ran@@ en have been together for more than 45 years .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve never felt better . &quot;
R@@ ai@@ ja and J@@ yr@@ ki O@@ ran@@ en , who has also worked in the travel industry , have already been together for more than 40 years .
&quot; I proposed , and we got mar@@ ried in two weeks , &quot; R@@ ai@@ ja says lau@@ gh@@ ing .
&quot; she &apos;s always been such a dra@@ ma qu@@ een , ending her life every now and then , &quot; J@@ yr@@ ki says .

travell@@ ers negotiate tr@@ en@@ ch , return to &apos; mill@@ ion@@ air@@ e &apos;s row@@ &apos;
some of the West M@@ id@@ lands &apos; we@@ al@@ thi@@ est hom@@ e@@ owners are again at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads with determined travell@@ ers who have negotiated a coun@@ c@@ il@@ -@@ du@@ g tr@@ en@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field outside their man@@ sions .
the travell@@ ers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a prosper@@ ous stre@@ et of Sol@@ ih@@ ul@@ l du@@ b@@ bed &apos; mill@@ ion@@ air@@ e &apos;s row &apos; .
bringing hor@@ ses , bab@@ ies and an army of v@@ ans , they have returned after being k@@ ic@@ ked out only in May , un@@ deter@@ red by a mo@@ at du@@ g by the council to prevent their inc@@ ur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the def@@ ences , squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ing their vehicles though a section left un@@ bar@@ ric@@ aded to accommo@@ date a pa@@ th@@ way .
fu@@ rious residents have sa@@ va@@ ged Sol@@ ih@@ ul@@ l Council saying it was &apos; us@@ eless at dealing with the problem &apos; .
one an@@ ony@@ m@@ ous resid@@ ent said : &apos; they moved there on Monday night after being moved on from B@@ ent@@ ley He@@ ath where they were thro@@ wing ro@@ cks at pass@@ ers by .
the council needs to be sha@@ med into action as they are us@@ eless at dealing with the problem .
the travell@@ ers were there in May , were moved on and now they are back again .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &apos;
she added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m council knows how to deal with this by getting long in@@ jun@@ c@@ tions to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on S@@ tre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road and I &apos;@@ m not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can &apos;@@ t even stop this . &apos;
one local resid@@ ent who did not wish to be na@@ med said : &apos; it is ridiculous , we have only just seen the last round of these travell@@ ers leaving , only to be b@@ li@@ ghted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and a hor@@ se has even been seen gra@@ z@@ ing on the par@@ kl@@ and . &apos;
a spo@@ kes@@ woman for Sol@@ ih@@ ul@@ l Council said : &apos; we are aware of an un@@ authorised enc@@ a@@ mp@@ ment on land off S@@ tre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k Ro@@ ad and working alongside Sol@@ ih@@ ul@@ l Pol@@ ice , we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible .
to support our evidence gather@@ ing it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti@@ -@@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 1@@ 01 .
this helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them . &apos;
en@@ ra@@ ged people surroun@@ ded cr@@ as@@ hed plan@@ e in Portugal
men who made emergency lan@@ ding on a pac@@ ked be@@ ach in Portugal were heard at court today .
as a result of the cr@@ as@@ h lan@@ ding , two people died yesterday .
the two men who pil@@ oted the plan@@ e may be indic@@ ted for neg@@ li@@ gent hom@@ ic@@ ide .
in Portugal , the most severe punishment for neg@@ li@@ gent hom@@ ic@@ ide is 16 years of imprison@@ ment .
a technical fault forced the light plan@@ e pil@@ oted by the two men to cr@@ as@@ h land on the Sa@@ o J@@ o@@ a@@ o da Ca@@ par@@ ic@@ a be@@ ach near Lisbon .
at the time of the cr@@ as@@ h , the be@@ ach was full of people , some of whom escap@@ ed the cr@@ as@@ hing plan@@ e by running in the water .
when lan@@ ding , the plan@@ e hit a 5@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man and an 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l who died immediately .
the plan@@ e first hit the man who had his back turned towards the plan@@ e .
F@@ ili@@ pe J@@ an@@ eir@@ a who was at the be@@ ach told J@@ or@@ nal de No@@ ti@@ ci@@ as that immediately after@@ wards the plan@@ e as@@ cen@@ ded and , when it des@@ cen@@ ded again , it hit the child in the head .
the dec@@ e@@ ased g@@ ir@@ l was at the be@@ ach with her parents
who were not inju@@ red .
immediately after the cr@@ as@@ h , en@@ ra@@ ged people surroun@@ ded the cr@@ as@@ hed plan@@ e .
C@@ el@@ ia Ro@@ ch@@ a who witnessed the incident told Cor@@ re@@ io de Man@@ ha that the g@@ ir@@ l &apos;s fa@@ ther and other people ran to the plan@@ e and started b@@ ang@@ ing on its re@@ ar .
the man called the pilot a criminal - he was desperate .
it is a wonder that no more people were killed .
the two men who pil@@ oted the plan@@ e were not inju@@ red .
Finnish sta@@ r who trag@@ ically lost his le@@ g won another g@@ old me@@ d@@ al in World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships : &quot; without the accident , I W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be the World champ@@ ion &quot;
early on Wednesday morning , M@@ at@@ ti S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i won the g@@ old me@@ d@@ al in the ban@@ ked s@@ l@@ alo@@ m event in the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships held in Bi@@ g White , Canada .
earlier , S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i had also won the cross event .
altogether , he now has three g@@ old me@@ d@@ als in World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships .
&quot; these World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships have been pre@@ tty ama@@ z@@ ing !
we &apos;@@ ve won two g@@ old me@@ d@@ als and are really pu@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; said S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i who was contac@@ ted by telephone .
the 3@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old rid@@ er than@@ ked his co@@ ach and his excellent preparations in Finland .
according to S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i , the number of challeng@@ ers is constantly increasing .
&quot; Par@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding has grown and evol@@ ved notably .
g@@ aps between rac@@ ers are becoming smaller , and there are a number of new rid@@ ers .
I always think that there is someone new ready to be@@ at me .
every competition seems to have a different w@@ inner . &quot;
S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i lost one of his leg@@ s in a motor@@ cycle accident in 200@@ 9 .
he has always been an enthusias@@ tic s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der ever since his chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and the accident could not keep him off the s@@ lop@@ es .
&quot; every now and then I can &apos;@@ t help but wonder what my life would &apos;@@ ve been like without the accident .
but , I &apos;@@ ve always thought that there &apos;s no going back .
you play the hand you &apos;@@ re dealt , &quot; S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i stresses .
it would be cru@@ el to say that the serious accident and losing a le@@ g were a s@@ tro@@ ke of lu@@ ck , and S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i does not .
however , he was able to turn his difficulty into an advantage .
&quot; I &apos;@@ d say that everything turned for the better .
I W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be a thre@@ e@@ -@@ time World champ@@ ion without the accident . &quot;
before the accident , 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i was losing interest in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding .
&quot; I really started working to reach the top after the accident .
when I was youn@@ ger , I trained with my friends , and we were always wat@@ ching the X@@ -@@ G@@ ames .
they were only dis@@ tant d@@ rea@@ ms that nearly died as time moved on .
after the accident , I some@@ how found myself rac@@ ing at the X@@ -@@ G@@ ames .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have imag@@ ined it .
I was 23 and I thought that this will be a long life if I stay here feeling b@@ itte@@ r and feeling sorry for myself .
I decided to ro@@ ll up my s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and start working .
I &apos;@@ d say that I &apos;@@ ve succeeded quite well . &quot;
the rid@@ er was el@@ ated when whe@@ el@@ chair rac@@ er Le@@ o@@ -@@ P@@ e@@ k@@ ka T@@ ä@@ h@@ ti was selec@@ ted the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete of the Year in Finland .
the four@@ -@@ time Olympic g@@ old me@@ d@@ all@@ ist received the award at the S@@ ports G@@ al@@ a held in May .
according to S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i , this recognition is an important signal for par@@ as@@ ports .
&quot; it was huge , and T@@ ä@@ h@@ ti absolutely ear@@ ned it .
this will undoubtedly turn eyes towards par@@ as@@ ports . &quot;
when will be the time to launch the campaign for selec@@ ting tw@@ o@@ -@@ time World champ@@ ion M@@ at@@ ti S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete of the Year ?
&quot; we &apos;@@ ll see .
I &apos;@@ m doing my best to succeed . &quot;
so far , S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i has not con@@ qu@@ ered all the pe@@ a@@ ks he wants .
he has set a major goal for next year
when the Par@@ al@@ y@@ mp@@ ic G@@ ames will be held in South Korea .

majority of young Sy@@ rian refugees do not expect to return to their hom@@ el@@ and , unless the war ends and IS@@ IS is driven out
a V@@ o@@ ice for Y@@ oun@@ g Sy@@ rian Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es survey identified the opinions and attitudes of young Sy@@ rian refugees living in Jord@@ an and Lebanon .
Sy@@ rian refugees ba@@ king bre@@ ad at a refugee cam@@ p in Jord@@ an .
the majority of young Sy@@ rian refugees do not expect to make a permanent return to their hom@@ el@@ and .
they believe that the Sy@@ rian civil war would have to end and IS@@ IS would have to be driven out of the country in order for them to return .
the tru@@ mp administration is not expected to bring about a change to the Sy@@ rian conflict .
B@@ ur@@ s@@ on@@ -@@ Mar@@ ste@@ ller , a global public relations and communications firm , conducted an international survey to identify the opinions and attitudes of young Sy@@ rian refugees .
B@@ ur@@ s@@ on@@ -@@ Mar@@ ste@@ ller has stu@@ died the opinions and attitudes of young people in Arab countries during nine years .
this year &apos;s A V@@ o@@ ice for Y@@ oun@@ g Sy@@ rian Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es survey identified the opinions and attitudes of young Sy@@ rian refugees living in Jord@@ an and Lebanon .
in February and March 20@@ 17 , a total of 400 young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans aged 18@@ -@@ 24 responded to the survey . half of these were women and half were men .
half of the inter@@ views were conducted in Jord@@ an and half in Lebanon .
according to the survey , more than half of all young Sy@@ rian refugees do not expect to make a permanent return to their hom@@ el@@ and .
of all respon@@ d@@ ents , 42 per cent thought that they might return to their hom@@ el@@ and and four per cent did not know whether or not a return is possible .
according to the survey , key factors among young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are the war in Syria and the presence of IS@@ IS in the country .
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) of all respon@@ d@@ ents thought that the end of the war is the most significant factor affecting their return home , while one quarter considered that driving IS@@ IS out of the country is the key factor .
less than ten per cent mentioned an improved financial situation or the ex@@ it of Bas@@ ha@@ r al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d from Syria as the most critical factor .
military actions alone cannot resolve the conflict
young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans were asked to name the most important factor to end the conflict .
the majority of all respon@@ d@@ ents considered that ending the war is more important Bas@@ ha@@ r al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d ren@@ oun@@ cing power .
a little more than 25 per cent thought that the presidency of al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d is an obstacle to a peace treaty .
nearly half of all respon@@ d@@ ents felt that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria .
only a little more than 25 per cent considered that military action alone can resolve the conflict .
the majority of young Sy@@ rian refugees saw that IS@@ IS has lost power over the past year , whereas 20 per cent felt that its power has increased .
according to the respon@@ d@@ ents , what is important in the fight against IS@@ IS is that the media would convey information to people , saying that IS@@ IS has nothing to do with Isla@@ m .
nearly as many respon@@ d@@ ents mentioned military actions and an educational reform as primary means .
a little more than ten per cent thought that the most important factor would be to create better paying jobs for young people .
when asked about the impact of the tru@@ mp administration on the Sy@@ rian conflict , 66 per cent of all respon@@ d@@ ents said that the conflict will not change during tru@@ mp &apos;s ten@@ ure .
nearly 25 per cent believed that the Sy@@ rian conflict will get worse during tru@@ mp &apos;s presidency .
whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or wor@@ sen@@ ed the conflict split the respon@@ d@@ ents into two groups .
Mon@@ ty W@@ iden@@ i@@ us spen@@ ds half his time co@@ ding in Ka@@ uni@@ a@@ inen to keep the inter@@ net in perfect order - his datab@@ ase is used by W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia and Go@@ og@@ le
Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , a company based in Es@@ po@@ o , is developing &quot; the world &apos;s fas@@ test growing &quot; open source datab@@ ase .
the main product of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , established by co@@ der and entreprene@@ ur Mic@@ ha@@ el &quot; Mon@@ ty &quot; W@@ iden@@ i@@ us , is free of charge for its users , and it can be developed by any ski@@ lled progra@@ mm@@ er through the Internet .
for example , Go@@ og@@ le and W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia use the Finnish datab@@ ase , but they may not be any paying customers .
with datab@@ ases , huge volu@@ mes of data can be kept in order and quickly available .
if you use , for example , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In , T@@ wit@@ ter or Bo@@ o@@ k@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m , you are using the datab@@ ase of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B or M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L .
&quot; all information that is not in image for@@ mat , comes from a datab@@ ase , and that is where ima@@ ges are also linked , &quot; W@@ iden@@ i@@ us says .
W@@ iden@@ i@@ us , who works as the C@@ T@@ O of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , spen@@ ds half of his time co@@ ding .
working remo@@ tely from Ka@@ uni@@ a@@ inen , W@@ iden@@ i@@ us makes sure that the Internet works as it should .
W@@ iden@@ i@@ us , together with David A@@ x@@ mark from Sweden , is the develop@@ er of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , the world &apos;s most popular open source datab@@ ase .
in 2008 , technology company S@@ un b@@ ought M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L at a price of one billion doll@@ ars and , a year later , software gi@@ ant or@@ ac@@ le acquired S@@ un at 7@@ .@@ 4 billion doll@@ ars .
when the or@@ ac@@ le deal lan@@ ded , the majority of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L develop@@ ers announced their intention to leave .
&quot; they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t want to work for or@@ ac@@ le which d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t give a definite promise of the future of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , &quot; W@@ iden@@ i@@ us says .
at this stage , he had already established a company to develop Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
he did not want to see his life &apos;s work die .
&quot; I hi@@ red the twenty best develop@@ ers from S@@ un and made sure that the code sta@@ ys safe in the hands of the same people who created it in the first place . &quot;
because M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L is an open source datab@@ ase , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B was able to develop a new bran@@ ch from it .
only the name had to be changed .
a foundation was set up to super@@ v@@ ise that the code of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B can be developed freely .
&quot; we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t use similar safeguards when developing M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , &quot; says W@@ iden@@ i@@ us .
even though many have heard of W@@ iden@@ i@@ us and the billion dollar M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L deal , not many in Finland know anything about Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
&quot; in recent years , we &apos;@@ ve ground by about 50 per cent a year , &quot; says K@@ enn@@ et@@ h Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n , C@@ F@@ O at Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
at this point , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B focuses on growth , not on profit , and Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n has little to say about the company &apos;s key figures .
he does reve@@ al that Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B ex@@ pects to obtain new orders worth 20 million euros during this financial period .
because the datab@@ ase is free of charge , the company has developed au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary services for which corporate customers are ready to pay .
Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B also helps to exchange datab@@ ases , which may take more than a year if a custom@@ er has used a closed datab@@ ase .
a swit@@ ch from M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L to Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B is quick and easy , as the two are different ver@@ sions of each other .
for example , T@@ el@@ ef@@ ó@@ nic@@ a , a Spanish telec@@ om oper@@ ator , and D@@ B@@ S , the largest bank in Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , are paying customers of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
the most popular cl@@ ou@@ d services , such as A@@ ma@@ z@@ on A@@ W@@ S , Mic@@ ro@@ soft Az@@ ure and A@@ li@@ bab@@ a cl@@ ou@@ d , offer Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B to their customers .
at the same time , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B spre@@ ads automatically to new users through L@@ in@@ u@@ x operating system packa@@ ges in which Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B has largely replaced M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L .
even though we are a small company , we are connected to major players .
&quot; our customers include the world &apos;s largest telec@@ om operators , game develop@@ ers , banks and even a few central banks , &quot; Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n says .
the datab@@ ase market is still domin@@ ated by gi@@ ants , such as or@@ ac@@ le , Mic@@ ro@@ soft , I@@ B@@ M and SA@@ P , with their closed datab@@ ases .
for or@@ ac@@ le , M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L means a modest secondary business opportunity compared with its traditional closed datab@@ ase .
even though the largest datab@@ ase companies have lost their market shares according to research company Gar@@ t@@ ner , players such as Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B are small and in@@ significant firms , albeit quickly growing ones , measured by net sales .
in the datab@@ ase market of rou@@ gh@@ ly 50 million doll@@ ars , open source datab@@ ases cannot even reach the threshold of one billion .
however , the significance of open source software cannot be measured in money alone , as the majority of users do not pay anything for its use .
Gar@@ t@@ ner estimates that , in 20@@ 18 , companies will develop more than 70 per cent of their internal applications using open source datab@@ ases .
in addition , more than half of older datab@@ ases will be replaced by open source datab@@ ases , or at least this transition will have been initiated .
&quot; major corpor@@ ations do not obtain new customers , as most users selec@@ t open source software .
this means that the lic@@ ence fe@@ es of commercial datab@@ ases are sky high .
companies want to make as much money as they used to do , with fewer customers , &quot; W@@ iden@@ i@@ us says .
because it takes a lot of work to replace a closed datab@@ ase , most custom@@ er companies have qui@@ et@@ ly accepted the increased prices .
&quot; we have many customers for which it &apos;s really difficult to make this transition , because their applications and other solutions are ti@@ ed to a closed datab@@ ase , &quot; says W@@ iden@@ i@@ us .
he still believes that customers will soon have had enough .
as lic@@ ence fe@@ es go higher year after year , customers will eventually swit@@ ch to an open source datab@@ ase .
the price is 10 to 20 per cent of what it was and service is better , as customers can easily change to another datab@@ ase .
besides , many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their functions to cl@@ ou@@ d services .
at the same time , many want to change their datab@@ ase software .
last spring , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B acquired a lo@@ an of 25 million euros from the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) .
this was the largest growth lo@@ an ever given by the EIB in the Nordic countries .
the company has 1@@ 15 employees around the world , and it intends to h@@ ire more .
one reason for obtaining funding from the EIB was the impact Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B has on public IT procurement .
the company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany , among others .
in Europe , the public sector is paying bill@@ ions of euros a year for datab@@ ases .
&quot; many countries want to adopt open source solutions and , therefore , use tax revenue more effectively , &quot; Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n says .
W@@ iden@@ i@@ us is not happy about how Finland is spending money on , say , closed heal@@ th@@ care systems , while open source systems are che@@ aper and do not tie the cli@@ ent to a single software company .
some say that open source is an ide@@ ology , but I believe that it is a better way of co@@ ding .
a community helps and creates something you cannot inv@@ ent or do .
alongside another Fin@@ n , L@@ in@@ us Tor@@ val@@ ds , the develop@@ er of L@@ in@@ u@@ x , W@@ iden@@ i@@ us , 55 , is one of the best known contribu@@ tors to open source software .
W@@ iden@@ i@@ us helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source .
I still give four to five speeches on open source in different parts of the world .
Italy tou@@ gh@@ ens tone on NG@@ O mi@@ grant res@@ c@@ ue boats
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs operating mi@@ grant res@@ c@@ ue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue operating , &quot; In@@ teri@@ or Minister Mar@@ co M@@ inn@@ iti said in an inter@@ view with Tur@@ in daily L@@ a Sta@@ mp@@ a .
M@@ inn@@ iti &apos;s warning came a day after Italian authorities imp@@ ounded a bo@@ at oper@@ ated by German aid organis@@ ati@@ ion J@@ ug@@ end R@@ et@@ te@@ t on suspic@@ ion its crew effectively collabor@@ ated with people traffic@@ kers in a way that facilita@@ ted illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been operational for a year , dec@@ lined to comment on the substance of detailed alleg@@ ations made against it by Italian prosecu@@ tor Am@@ bro@@ gi@@ o Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us the res@@ c@@ ue of human life is and will be our top priority , so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and res@@ c@@ ue zone at the moment , &quot; the organisation said in a statement on social media .
&quot; we can only assess all the accus@@ ations currently being made after we have gather@@ ed all the information and can assess the situation . &quot;
Italian authorities had been monitoring J@@ ug@@ end R@@ et@@ te@@ t &apos;s bo@@ at , the I@@ u@@ ven@@ ta , since October .
its crew is sus@@ pected to taking on board din@@ gh@@ y lo@@ ads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffic@@ kers and allowing the smugg@@ l@@ ers to make off with the vessels to be used again .
at least one such meeting alleg@@ edly took place only 1.@@ 3 mil@@ es off the Li@@ by@@ an coast , according to the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s f@@ ile , the conten@@ ts of which were published by Italian media .
the crew are sus@@ pected of having flou@@ ted the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , which over@@ sees res@@ c@@ ue operations in the zone , out of humanitarian z@@ e@@ al rather than for any other mo@@ tives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ ven@@ ta would notably have to have an Italian police offic@@ er on board monitoring their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and res@@ c@@ ue operations have so far agreed to ab@@ ide by the code : save The Ch@@ il@@ dren , M@@ al@@ ta@@ -@@ based MO@@ AS and Spain &apos;s Pro@@ -@@ Ac@@ ti@@ va O@@ p@@ en Ar@@ ms .
the latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any &quot; significant change or impe@@ di@@ ment &quot; to its res@@ c@@ ue operations .
among those who have refused to sign is the No@@ bel P@@ ri@@ z@@ e@@ -@@ w@@ inning organisation D@@ oc@@ tors Wi@@ th@@ out B@@ orders ( M@@ S@@ F ) .
M@@ inn@@ iti meanwhile said a shar@@ p fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arri@@ ving in Italy following res@@ cu@@ es was an indication that efforts to beef up the Li@@ by@@ an coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors was bearing fruit .
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; the minister said .
he revealed plans for further talks this month with Li@@ by@@ an may@@ ors on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , N@@ ig@@ er and M@@ ali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe .

British ac@@ tor Robert Har@@ dy has died at the age of 91 .
his death was reported by his family on Thursday .

during his long career , he also acted in fil@@ ms and on television .
Har@@ dy is remember@@ ed for his role as Cor@@ n@@ eli@@ us f@@ ud@@ ge , the Minister of ma@@ gic , in Har@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter fil@@ ms and his performance as a v@@ et in Al@@ l cre@@ a@@ tures Great and S@@ m@@ all based on the book of J@@ ames Her@@ ri@@ ot .

Mic@@ he@@ lle Car@@ ter senten@@ ced for texts ur@@ ging suicide of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y
a M@@ assa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts woman has been senten@@ ced to two and a half years for encouraging her bo@@ y@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls .
Mic@@ he@@ lle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will serve 15 months of her term behind b@@ ars and five years of prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June of the inv@@ ol@@ un@@ tary man@@ slaughter of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , who took his own life on 13 July 20@@ 14 .
Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s fa@@ ther told Thursday &apos;s hearing : &quot; my family is hear@@ t@@ broken .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal .
she had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Ro@@ y suffered from mental ill@@ ness .
d@@ res@@ sed in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ am b@@ l@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood te@@ ar@@ fully with hands clas@@ ped and eyes cast down as she was senten@@ ced .
&quot; her actions killed Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , &quot; the prosecu@@ tor told the court .
&quot; she ended his life to better her own .
she has not accepted responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s law@@ yer said it was a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stan@@ ce that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
however , J@@ ud@@ ge L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence Mon@@ i@@ z said he did not find that her &quot; age or level of ma@@ tur@@ ity or even her mental ill@@ ness have any significant impact on her actions . &quot;
a prosecu@@ tor read a statement from Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s mother , L@@ yn@@ n Ro@@ y , saying there was &quot; not one day I do not m@@ our@@ n the loss of my bel@@ ov@@ ed son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sis@@ ters in all of my pain we will carry with us for e@@ tern@@ ity , &quot; it said .
Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s sis@@ ter , Cam@@ d@@ y@@ n Ro@@ y , tes@@ ti@@ fied that she was &quot; ha@@ un@@ ted &quot; by the re@@ alisation that she would never attend her bro@@ ther &apos;s w@@ ed@@ ding or be an a@@ un@@ t to his children .
&quot; not having that one person I &apos;@@ ve been with every day since birth is a pain I &apos;@@ ll always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case appears to set a legal precedent , as there is no M@@ assa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts law that crimin@@ alis@@ es telling a person to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 when Mr Ro@@ y was found dead of car@@ bon mon@@ ox@@ ide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 20@@ 14 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; han@@ g yourself , ju@@ mp off a building , sta@@ b yourself I don &apos;@@ t know there &apos;s a lot of ways , &quot; she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holid@@ ay with his family .
in the mom@@ ents before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you need to do it , Con@@ ra@@ d &quot; and &quot; Al@@ l you have to do is turn the gener@@ ator on and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ i@@ z said Car@@ ter sought attention through Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s death , or@@ dering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press .
the case has divided legal opinion .
among the few to defend Car@@ ter was A@@ man@@ da K@@ no@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of mur@@ dering her British ro@@ om@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before she was cle@@ ared two years ago .
M@@ s K@@ no@@ x , 30 , published an op@@ -@@ ed in the L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es T@@ imes saying : &quot; Mic@@ he@@ lle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
NATO Secretary General : worst relations with Russia since the C@@ old War
J@@ ens S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg , NATO Secretary General , commen@@ ted on Thursday that relations between NATO and Russia have become significantly col@@ der .
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg bla@@ med Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine .
&quot; I think it is correct to say that NATO &apos;s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the C@@ old War , &quot; S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg told C@@ N@@ N .
&quot; at the end of the C@@ old War , we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia .
but particularly after the illegal anne@@ x@@ ation of C@@ r@@ im@@ ea in 20@@ 14 and the continued Russian destabil@@ isation of eastern Ukraine , the relationship between NATO and Russia has deterior@@ ated considerably . &quot;
according to S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg , NATO is still committed to avoiding a further sp@@ ike in tensions .
&quot; as long as we are strong , as long as we are predic@@ table , we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escal@@ ation and avoid a new C@@ old War . &quot;
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg &apos;s remarks came as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all@@ -@@ time and very dangerous low .
tru@@ mp bla@@ med the US Congress for the poor relationship , as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week .
A@@ ud@@ i to modi@@ fy U@@ p to 8@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 diesel V@@ eh@@ ic@@ les as Car@@ makers face bac@@ kl@@ as@@ h
a day before A@@ ud@@ i &apos;s announcement , B@@ M@@ W said it would offer to up@@ grade the software in more than 3@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 vehicles .
the B@@ M@@ W chairman said the company believed &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; referring to the European cities - including M@@ un@@ ich , where B@@ M@@ W is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
D@@ a@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that it would modi@@ fy three million Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the moves as rec@@ all@@ s .
European car@@ makers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on car@@ bon diox@@ ide emissions .
but the nit@@ ro@@ gen ox@@ ides that diesel eng@@ ines e@@ mit are considered car@@ c@@ ino@@ g@@ ens , and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost to autom@@ o@@ tive companies of insta@@ lling equipment to neutr@@ ali@@ ze the fu@@ mes emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
as German autom@@ ak@@ ers face scrutiny , the government of Chan@@ cell@@ or Ang@@ ela Mer@@ ke@@ l has also been accused of co@@ d@@ d@@ ling the powerful car companies and of ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid repe@@ ating the mistakes of V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en , which covered up its use of so@@ -@@ called defe@@ at de@@ vices that could ad@@ just emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested , but e@@ ase back in normal driving conditions .
several V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en execu@@ tives have been charged in the United States , and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ na@@ m@@ ics at A@@ ud@@ i &apos;s eng@@ ine development depart@@ ment was arrested in Germany .
the former manag@@ er , Z@@ acc@@ he@@ o Gi@@ ov@@ an@@ n@@ i Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian , and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States .
early this year , A@@ ud@@ i was sw@@ ep@@ t up into a German criminal investigation involving V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en after the authorities accused A@@ ud@@ i of insta@@ lling a system to eva@@ de emissions rules in Europe , broad@@ ening an inquiry that had focused on the United States .
the inclusion of A@@ ud@@ i in the investigation could wei@@ gh heavily on V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en : the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y car@@ ma@@ k@@ er accounts for a dis@@ proportionate share of V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en &apos;s profit .
elections in Venezu@@ ela investig@@ ated as rig@@ ged , lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale protes@@ ts expected
according to the company , the number of voters reported by Venezu@@ el@@ an officials is higher than the number of actual voters by at least one million .
Ti@@ b@@ is@@ ay L@@ uc@@ en@@ an , chair of the national election committee told re@@ por@@ ters that this is an unprecedented opinion from a company which has no role in the election results .
Mad@@ uro states that the crisis will end .
on S@@ un@@ day , dele@@ gates were elected in Venezu@@ ela after controversial elections to change the constitution .
the opposition has already strongly criticised the elections and organised protes@@ ts .
Mad@@ uro &apos;s opposition has postponed its protes@@ ts until the ap@@ poin@@ tments .
according to El Pa@@ is , national security forces started to take hold of the parliament building in Wednesday evening , local time .
their purpose is to ensure that the appointment event sta@@ ys safe .
Pro@@ v@@ ence la@@ ven@@ der under threat from climate change
it has become a sym@@ bo@@ l of Pro@@ v@@ ence in southern France , but there is a warning that it &apos;s under threat from climate change .
La@@ ven@@ der is in decline because of d@@ rou@@ ght@@ -@@ like conditions and dis@@ e@@ ase@@ -@@ carrying insec@@ ts , causing a major head@@ ac@@ he for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions .
E@@ ric Cha@@ is@@ se , an expert at the Pro@@ v@@ enc@@ e@@ -@@ based agricultural research institu@@ te C@@ R@@ I@@ E@@ P@@ P@@ A@@ M , said : &quot; La@@ ven@@ der in Pro@@ v@@ ence is effectively endang@@ ered , because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less ra@@ in in the spring and mos@@ tly in the autumn .
this affects the lif@@ es@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there &apos;s also a small c@@ ic@@ ada , a mic@@ ro@@ -@@ bac@@ teri@@ a trans@@ mitting lea@@ f h@@ opp@@ er , and in very dr@@ y wea@@ ther there are lo@@ ts of them . &quot;
and a lot is at stake .
as well as attrac@@ ting holid@@ a@@ y@@ makers , la@@ ven@@ der oil is highly sought after for per@@ fu@@ me and cosmetics .
E@@ ric Cha@@ is@@ se said : &quot; instead of having very long plant e@@ ars with a number of large flo@@ w@@ ers , we have smaller ones , under@@ developed and either missing or weaken@@ ed .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions being looked at include better water distribution and s@@ lo@@ wing down eva@@ por@@ ation from the soil , but also sp@@ ra@@ ying the plants with a protec@@ tive mi@@ x of cla@@ y and water and developing vari@@ eties more resis@@ tant to dr@@ y conditions .
a journ@@ alist &apos;s murder under@@ sco@@ res growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the wee@@ kly newspaper R@@ io@@ do@@ ce normally meets on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for cover@@ age of the most recent may@@ he@@ m w@@ rought in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a state by organ@@ iz@@ ed crime , cor@@ rupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they &apos;@@ ve come together to talk about security .
it &apos;s important to change their rou@@ tin@@ es , they are told .
two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a g@@ ren@@ ade attack in 200@@ 9 , or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a bla@@ ck@@ board at the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ aries , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to suggest names for each c@@ olu@@ mn - no proof is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and g@@ ut feelings are enough .
there are d@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ traffic@@ kers , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ people , journalists sus@@ pected of being on the pay@@ ro@@ ll of the government or the car@@ tel@@ s , a ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ g of vill@@ ain@@ s who make the job of covering Mexico &apos;s cha@@ os per@@ il@@ ous .
there is no res@@ pit@@ e from the violence , and as bodies p@@ ile up across the country , more and more of them are journalists : at least 25 since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to took office in December 20@@ 12 , according to the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists ; 5@@ 89 under federal protection after attacks and threats ; and so far this year , at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latest is their ed@@ itor and inspi@@ ration , R@@ io@@ do@@ ce co@@ -@@ foun@@ der J@@ avi@@ er Val@@ de@@ z Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journ@@ alist , &quot; Val@@ de@@ z wrote in one of his many books on nar@@ co@@ -@@ violence .
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large p@@ ho@@ to of Val@@ de@@ z dis@@ playing his middle fin@@ ger , with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; han@@ gs on the fac@@ ade of the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce building ; two re@@ por@@ ters on their 3@@ 0s , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ i@@ ri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , we@@ ar T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts that dis@@ play his s@@ mil@@ ing , bes@@ pec@@ ta@@ cl@@ ed face or his tra@@ de@@ mark P@@ an@@ ama h@@ at .
the wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p takes place less than two months after his death ; the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared tra@@ u@@ ma , their ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ ni@@ a , par@@ an@@ o@@ ia .
although a special federal prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to han@@ dle the journalists &apos; cases , it has only prosecu@@ ted two , according to the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders ti@@ ed to drug trafficking and organ@@ iz@@ ed crime each year , the ki@@ ll@@ ers of journalists are rar@@ ely brought to justice .
at R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , they persis@@ t in covering the violence of S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , though they are hear@@ t@@ broken , though the ter@@ ra@@ in is more tre@@ ac@@ her@@ ous now .
without information on the ki@@ ll@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
&quot; it &apos;s very fo@@ ol@@ ish to waste my time in this wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;@@ t know why , you dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ de@@ z left the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive just a couple bloc@@ ks before his red To@@ yo@@ ta Co@@ ro@@ lla was stopped by two men ; he was forced out of his car and sh@@ ot 12 times , presu@@ ma@@ bly for the name of the paper - which trans@@ lates as t@@ w@@ el@@ f@@ th R@@ iver .
the g@@ un@@ man dro@@ ve away in his car and cr@@ as@@ hed it ne@@ ar@@ by .
Val@@ de@@ z was 50 years old .
he left a wi@@ fe and two ad@@ ult children .
Ru@@ mor@@ s tend to fly freely in C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z , there &apos;s practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , S@@ in@@ alo@@ a has been one of the country &apos;s b@@ loo@@ di@@ est b@@ att@@ leg@@ ro@@ unds as ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight to fill the va@@ c@@ uu@@ m .
never mind that someone or several people are sh@@ ot dead in the stre@@ et every day in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , or that the ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y is fi@@ lled with or@@ n@@ ate , tw@@ o@@ -@@ story ma@@ us@@ ol@@ e@@ ums for drug k@@ ings , larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that a state of &quot; cal@@ m &quot; is when just one car@@ te@@ l is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and d@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ trafficking routes to the United States .
despite that , and the fact that Val@@ de@@ z was inti@@ mately aware of the per@@ ils of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , 60 , a co@@ -@@ foun@@ der and direc@@ tor of R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , is w@@ rac@@ ked with gu@@ il@@ t for failing to protect his friend .
he believes two errors contributed to the killing .
first there was the publication in February of an inter@@ view with D@@ am@@ as@@ o L@@ op@@ e@@ z , a leader of one of the ri@@ val car@@ te@@ l fac@@ tions at war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s s@@ ons .
the piece may have ang@@ ered the s@@ ons ; sus@@ pected gan@@ g members b@@ ought up every cop@@ y of the ed@@ ition as soon as they were delivered to new@@ s@@ stands .
the second mistake was not for@@ cing Val@@ de@@ z to leave the country for his own safety after the seiz@@ ure of another newspaper that carried the same story .
Val@@ de@@ z was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a mil@@ es@@ tone in Mexic@@ an violence against journalists .
he &apos;@@ d survi@@ ved for so long , his friends and colleagues assu@@ med he &apos;@@ d always be there .
he was a ve@@ ter@@ an re@@ por@@ ter for No@@ ro@@ es@@ te in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , selling $ 50 shares .
in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to do journ@@ alism without tou@@ ching the nar@@ co issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time the paper ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation for bra@@ ve and honest cover@@ age , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters lov@@ ed being able to publis@@ h hard@@ -@@ h@@ it@@ ting investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and read@@ ers were fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated by a publication where they could read stor@@ ies nobody else d@@ ared to cover .
eight years after R@@ io@@ do@@ ce was founded , it won the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Mar@@ ia Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot award for cover@@ age in Latin America .
that same year , Val@@ de@@ z won the International P@@ ress Freed@@ om A@@ ward of the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it led .
he freely acknowledged that he was fri@@ gh@@ tened .
&quot; I want to carry on living , &quot; he said at the time of the C@@ P@@ J award .
drug trafficking in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October , in an inter@@ view with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV .
&quot; you have to assume the task that falls to you as a journ@@ alist - either that or you play du@@ m@@ b .
I don &apos;@@ t want to be asked , &apos; Wh@@ at were you doing in the face of so much death ... why d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t you say what was going on ? &apos; &quot;
the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce staff mis@@ ses Val@@ de@@ z , the jo@@ kes@@ ter who s@@ wor@@ e like a long@@ sh@@ ore@@ man , the friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teac@@ her who knew how to survive .
they reli@@ ed on his rou@@ tin@@ e .
he would always we@@ ar his h@@ at .
he would go to El Gu@@ a@@ y@@ ab@@ o , the b@@ ar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
now , they ask : was his love of rou@@ tin@@ e his down@@ fall ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how best to do their jobs and stay ali@@ ve .
&quot; they don &apos;@@ t like it if you m@@ ess with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their c@@ lan@@ destin@@ e air@@ stri@@ ps &quot; used to move drugs .
&quot; those things were off@@ -@@ limits , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best of times , a hi@@ gh@@ -@@ level of sel@@ f@@ -@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and sel@@ f@@ -@@ preservation .
trus@@ ting one &apos;s ins@@ t@@ inc@@ ts .
if it s@@ me@@ lls wrong , stay away .
the trouble , said R@@ io@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itor An@@ d@@ res V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real , is that &quot; s@@ m@@ ell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing with J@@ avi@@ er happened . &quot;
the old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a - just as they don &apos;@@ t in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ er@@ r@@ ero and other states that are home to a tox@@ ic mi@@ x of lu@@ cra@@ tive smugg@@ ling routes , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government officials .
the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e constantly shif@@ ts .
in the room where R@@ io@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ p@@ hon@@ es were allowed ; days before , it was revealed that sp@@ y@@ w@@ are sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and acti@@ vis@@ ts in Mexico .
outside , two police officers sought relief from the 10@@ 4@@ -@@ degree ( 40 C@@ el@@ si@@ us ) he@@ at in the sha@@ de of a tre@@ e .
they were as@@ signed by the state government to guard R@@ io@@ do@@ ce &apos;s offices , hou@@ sed in a four@@ -@@ story building in a mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ class neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
H@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ jo@@ k@@ ingly , some of the re@@ por@@ ters won@@ dered whether these officers are among the 50 per@@ cent of CO@@ Ps whom the govern@@ or himself has said are not trus@@ t@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the moun@@ tain@@ ous countryside , where the drug gan@@ gs are in de fac@@ to control .
for this week &apos;s ed@@ ition R@@ io@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stor@@ ies .
there was the killing of former bo@@ xing great Ju@@ li@@ o C@@ es@@ ar Cha@@ ve@@ z &apos;s bro@@ ther in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pose on government spending concentrated in the govern@@ or &apos;s hom@@ et@@ own .
and there was a group kid@@ na@@ pping in one of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants , a block from the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office .
there was no official word on who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant is a fav@@ or@@ ite of both drug traffic@@ kers and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ter learned from public recor@@ ds that the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant was registered under the name of a politic@@ ian belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional R@@ ev@@ olution Party , or P@@ R@@ I , which domin@@ ated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century .
recently several P@@ R@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption in hi@@ gh@@ -@@ profile cases .
V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about prior incidents in that loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El C@@ hap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed a military ra@@ id .
just months before , read@@ ers would have looked to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s c@@ olu@@ mn for the bes@@ t@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ ced information about the kid@@ na@@ pping .
&quot; before , we would have already known what happened , &quot; said V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nic@@ k@@ na@@ med &quot; El F@@ la@@ co &quot; for his s@@ len@@ der build .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . &quot;
Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a storage room for signs and stic@@ kers protes@@ ting journ@@ alist ki@@ ll@@ ings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : acti@@ vis@@ ts on behalf of the press .
re@@ por@@ ter M@@ i@@ ri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few of the signs and hea@@ ded out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office over yet another journ@@ alist .
Sal@@ va@@ dor A@@ da@@ me disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after Val@@ de@@ z was killed .
a bur@@ ned body has been discovered and officials say it is his , based on D@@ N@@ A tests .
nation@@ wide , journalists have become more voc@@ al , sc@@ ra@@ w@@ ling &quot; S@@ O@@ S P@@ ress &quot; on si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks and buildings in organ@@ iz@@ ed protes@@ ts .
on this day , the direc@@ tor Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington , trying to ra@@ lly international support for justice in the Val@@ de@@ z case .
at a meeting with the govern@@ or of S@@ in@@ alo@@ a the day after Val@@ de@@ z was killed , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth .
she has since asked to be reas@@ signed from covering the government , concerned that her ang@@ er has hur@@ t her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ de@@ z had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; surroun@@ ded &quot; by organ@@ iz@@ ed crime , complic@@ it government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book , &quot; N@@ ar@@ co@@ -@@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are being killed not just by drug gan@@ gs but on the order of politicians and security forces in ca@@ ho@@ ots with organ@@ iz@@ ed crime .
the media wat@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 at@@ tribu@@ ted more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want to sh@@ ut you up , &quot; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
clearly , the mur@@ ders have a ch@@ ill@@ ing effect .
no one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blo@@ gg@@ er Mar@@ ia E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h Mac@@ i@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ p@@ as .
her body was found along with a note pur@@ por@@ tedly signed by the Z@@ e@@ ta@@ s car@@ te@@ l : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ke@@ y@@ board and head@@ p@@ hon@@ es lay next to her sever@@ ed head .
some out@@ l@@ ets have op@@ ted to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state of Ch@@ ih@@ u@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ent Mi@@ ros@@ la@@ va breach in March .
others keep going , as El Man@@ ana of N@@ u@@ ev@@ o L@@ ar@@ ed@@ o did following the killing of its direc@@ tor in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ar@@ io de C@@ i@@ u@@ da@@ d Ju@@ ar@@ e@@ z addressed the drug car@@ tel@@ s publicly with a fron@@ t@@ -@@ page ed@@ itor@@ ial tit@@ led , &quot; Wh@@ at do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have f@@ led their home states or even the country .

H@@ ann@@ u M@@ ann@@ inen &apos;s Olympic project star@@ ts with a huge set@@ back - &quot; I@@ t &apos;s tough &quot;
H@@ ann@@ u M@@ ann@@ inen turned 39 in April , but did not celeb@@ rate long , as the professional pilot started to prepare for the Olympic se@@ as@@ on .
however , the training period had a catastro@@ phic start when M@@ ann@@ inen caught the fl@@ u .
this turned into a long period of ill@@ nesses , stret@@ ching to five weeks .
in practice , M@@ ann@@ inen was ill throughout May .
&quot; first I had the fl@@ u and finally an ear infec@@ tion , for which I had to take antibio@@ tics .
I was able to complete some ten per cent of the planned training sessions .
I don &apos;@@ t remember the last time I was that si@@ ck .
it was tough - I was hun@@ g@@ ry for training , but I just was@@ n &apos;@@ t able to do anything , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says to I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ San@@ om@@ at .
test results came down
the g@@ old me@@ d@@ all@@ ist in 2007 World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships was only allowed to train during the second week of June . this was reflected in the results of the t@@ read@@ m@@ ill test conducted by K@@ I@@ H@@ U - the Research Institu@@ te for Olympic S@@ ports - on 12 June .
in the test , an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete uses ro@@ ller s@@ kis to s@@ ki on a t@@ read@@ m@@ ill , the speed of which increases every three minutes .
after every thre@@ e@@ -@@ minute period , the t@@ read@@ m@@ ill is stopped for ten secon@@ ds , and the tes@@ ter takes a sa@@ mple of la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id from the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p .
&quot; last autumn , I was able to keep going for 32 minutes , but now I had to stop after 28 minutes .
I hit the wall , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says .
heading in a better direction
after initial difficulties , M@@ ann@@ inen says that he has sta@@ yed healthy .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve carried out slow aer@@ ob@@ ic exerc@@ ises to return my me@@ tab@@ ol@@ ism back to normal .
the last five weeks have been really good .
during M@@ id@@ summer , I also had a break of a week and a half from flying .
I was able to spend some time with my family at our holid@@ ay home . &quot;
last se@@ as@@ on , M@@ ann@@ inen only rac@@ ed in four World C@@ up compet@@ itions before the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in La@@ h@@ ti .
M@@ ann@@ inen reached his best position in the opening competition when he cl@@ im@@ bed up to 18@@ th place after an excellent ski@@ ing performance .
goals have been set
M@@ ann@@ inen and P@@ et@@ ter Ku@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ en , head co@@ ach of the national team , have prepared a training and rac@@ ing plan up to February .
&quot; we are looking for a different training r@@ hy@@ th@@ m compared with last se@@ as@@ on .
the se@@ as@@ on op@@ en@@ er is followed by a weekend of three World C@@ up star@@ ts in Ru@@ ka .
in December , the plan is to take part in at least one World C@@ up weekend , possibly in R@@ am@@ sa@@ u .
then , the plan is to race in Se@@ ef@@ el@@ d at the end of January .
after that , I hope that my name is on the list of the Olympic team , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says .
the O@@ l@@ y@@ mp@@ ics in P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Chan@@ g would be the sixth W@@ inter G@@ ames for M@@ ann@@ inen .
&quot; the important thing is to stay healthy , &quot; emphasises N@@ u@@ mm@@ el@@ a@@ -@@ based M@@ ann@@ inen who won the g@@ old me@@ d@@ al in the team event in Sal@@ t La@@ ke C@@ ity in 2002 .
din@@ os@@ au@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to eva@@ de its ene@@ mies
at first g@@ lan@@ ce , it looks like a sta@@ tue albeit a terri@@ fying one .
now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredi@@ ble r@@ h@@ ino@@ -@@ sized cre@@ a@@ ture found by a Can@@ a@@ dian min@@ er were so well preser@@ ved experts have described it as &apos; the Mon@@ a L@@ is@@ a of din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s &apos; .
it was so well preser@@ ved , they were even able to determine the col@@ our of its sc@@ al@@ y s@@ kin was a red@@ dis@@ h bro@@ wn - and say it had something of a &apos; tro@@ ub@@ led past &apos; .
the report in the jour@@ nal C@@ urr@@ ent Bi@@ ology described it as &apos; the bes@@ t@@ -@@ preser@@ ved ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ r speci@@ men@@ s in the world . &apos;
the fossi@@ l is a new@@ found species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ r , which lived mid@@ way through the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous period , between 110 million and 1@@ 12 million years ago .
it &apos;s incredi@@ ble well preser@@ ved state has s@@ tunn@@ ed researchers , who describe it as &apos; truly remar@@ ka@@ b@@ le@@ &apos;
the arm@@ oured plan@@ t@@ -@@ e@@ a@@ ter is the best preser@@ ved fossi@@ l of its kind ever found , according to reports in National geo@@ graphic .
it was found by S@@ ha@@ wn fun@@ k , when he was di@@ gging at the S@@ un@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium M@@ ine near For@@ t Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y in northern Al@@ ber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 20@@ 11 .
he hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding ro@@ ck , and decided to take a closer look .
the fossi@@ l he un@@ covered was sent to the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ ll M@@ use@@ um of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
they spent the next six years working on un@@ covering the be@@ ast within the 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00@@ -@@ p@@ ound ( 1@@ ,@@ 100 k@@ g ) lu@@ mp of earth .
after all that hard work , the finished result is now ready to be un@@ ve@@ iled .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ le@@ eping , &apos; said lead author C@@ al@@ e@@ b Bro@@ wn , a sci@@ ent@@ ist at the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ ll M@@ use@@ um where the cre@@ a@@ ture is on dis@@ play .
&apos;@@ I@@ t will go down in science history as one of the most beauti@@ ful and best preser@@ ved din@@ os@@ au@@ r speci@@ men@@ s - the Mon@@ a L@@ is@@ a of din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s . &apos;
by stud@@ ying its s@@ kin , researchers found that this plan@@ t@@ -@@ e@@ a@@ ter , though covered in arm@@ or and res@@ emb@@ ling a wal@@ king tan@@ k , likely faced a significant threat from me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r used red and white cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to hide from pre@@ d@@ ators , and employed a shi@@ el@@ ding techni@@ que known as counter@@ -@@ sha@@ ding , which is also used by many modern@@ -@@ day animals .
this would have allowed it to better b@@ l@@ end into its sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings and eva@@ de its ene@@ mies , experts say , suggesting it was pre@@ yed on by larger din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s .
the 1@@ 10@@ -@@ mill@@ ion@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old cre@@ a@@ ture , part of the no@@ dos@@ au@@ r family , first hit head@@ lines in May and is now on view at the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ ll M@@ use@@ um of P@@ ala@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
researchers have now stu@@ died and na@@ med the be@@ ast B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ che@@ ll@@ i after m@@ use@@ um techn@@ ic@@ ian Mar@@ k Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,@@ 000 hours pa@@ ins@@ ta@@ k@@ ingly un@@ covering it .
the ama@@ z@@ ing preservation of the spec@@ im@@ en made it possible for D@@ r Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pat@@ tern and shape of sc@@ al@@ es and arm@@ our across its body .
they discovered counter@@ sha@@ ding , a common method of defence in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , which means the top of the cre@@ a@@ ture was d@@ ar@@ k@@ er than its under@@ side .
although counter@@ sha@@ ding is common , the findings come as surprise because B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta &apos;s size far exce@@ eds that of counter@@ sha@@ ded animals ali@@ ve today .
it suggests the din@@ os@@ au@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s that ev@@ olution favoured conce@@ al@@ ment over confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most con@@ temporary animals that have counter@@ sha@@ ding -@@ - think de@@ er , z@@ eb@@ ra@@ s or arma@@ di@@ ll@@ os -@@ - are much smaller and more vulnerable as pre@@ y , sign@@ aling that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r faced a real struggle to survive .
&apos;@@ S@@ tr@@ ong pre@@ dation on a massive , heav@@ il@@ y@@ -@@ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r illustra@@ tes just how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ r pre@@ d@@ ators of the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous must have been , &apos; said Bro@@ wn .
chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds in its sc@@ al@@ es also reve@@ al that the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s s@@ kin would have been red@@ dis@@ h bro@@ wn .
scientists are continuing to study the animal for clu@@ es about its life , including its preser@@ ved g@@ ut conten@@ ts to find out what it ate for its last meal .
they believe that when the din@@ os@@ au@@ r died , it fel@@ l into a ri@@ ver and was sw@@ ep@@ t out to sea , where it san@@ k on its back to the oc@@ ean floor .
at that time , Al@@ ber@@ ta was as warm as south Flor@@ ida is today , and ri@@ vers and oc@@ e@@ ans likely spread far further in@@ land than they do now .
&apos;@@ T@@ his no@@ dos@@ au@@ r is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preser@@ ved sc@@ al@@ y s@@ kin , yet is also preser@@ ved in three dimensions , re@@ taining the original shape of the animal , &apos; said Bro@@ wn .
&apos;@@ The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the E@@ arly C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous .
you don &apos;@@ t need to use much imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it ; if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ le@@ eping . &apos;
the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous was a time when gi@@ ant ther@@ op@@ ods , me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s that stood on two leg@@ s , ro@@ am@@ ed the E@@ ar@@ th .
although the king of them all , T@@ y@@ rann@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , lived millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r may have been hun@@ ted by some of its for@@ mid@@ able an@@ c@@ es@@ tors .
they include A@@ cro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ us , a 3@@ 8@@ ft ( 11.@@ 5@@ m ) long mon@@ s@@ ter w@@ eigh@@ ing six tonnes .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the jour@@ nal C@@ urr@@ ent Bi@@ ology , believe B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was was@@ hed out to sea after it died and mu@@ mm@@ i@@ fied in mu@@ d .
the cre@@ a@@ ture was found by S@@ ha@@ wn fun@@ k , when he was di@@ gging at the Mill@@ en@@ ium M@@ ine near For@@ t Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y in northern Al@@ ber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 20@@ 11 .
according to the m@@ use@@ um , it is the best preser@@ ved arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r in the world , including s@@ kin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the s@@ n@@ out to H@@ IP@@ S .
the cre@@ a@@ tures were around 18 fe@@ et ( five met@@ res ) long on average , and wei@@ ghted up to 3@@ ,@@ 000 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ ,@@ 300 k@@ g ) .
it fea@@ tured two 20@@ -@@ in@@ ch@@ -@@ long sp@@ ik@@ es which pro@@ tru@@ ded from its shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the this ar@@ mo@@ red plan@@ t@@ -@@ e@@ a@@ ter lu@@ mber@@ ed through what is now western Canada , until a floo@@ ded ri@@ ver sw@@ ep@@ t it into open sea .
but the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s under@@ sea bu@@ ri@@ al preser@@ ved its arm@@ or in ex@@ qu@@ isite detail .
the fossi@@ lis@@ ed remains of this particular spec@@ im@@ en are so well preser@@ ved that re@@ m@@ n@@ ants of s@@ kin still cover bu@@ mp@@ y arm@@ our pla@@ tes along the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s s@@ k@@ u@@ l@@ l .
as Mic@@ ha@@ el G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National geo@@ graphic , such level of preservation &apos; is a r@@ are as w@@ inning the l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
the more I look at it , the more min@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ og@@ g@@ ling it becomes .
F@@ os@@ si@@ li@@ z@@ ed re@@ m@@ n@@ ants of s@@ kin still cover the bu@@ mp@@ y arm@@ or pla@@ tes d@@ ot@@ ting the animal &apos;s s@@ k@@ u@@ l@@ l .
its right fore@@ foot lies by its side , its five di@@ g@@ its s@@ played up@@ ward .
I can count the sc@@ al@@ es on its sole . &apos;
how one acti@@ vis@@ t came to learn the answer to the question : &apos; whose stre@@ ets ? &apos;
on A@@ ug@@ . 9 , 20@@ 14 , Brit@@ tan@@ y Fer@@ re@@ ll was sha@@ ken to her core .
just a day after arri@@ ving in New York C@@ ity on a tri@@ p , the S@@ t@@ . L@@ ou@@ is na@@ tive s@@ at on the bed of an A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b she was ren@@ ting , sc@@ ro@@ lling through F@@ ace@@ book on her phone .
she stu@@ mb@@ led upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old ki@@ d and he &apos;s still laying in the stre@@ et , &quot; it read .
confused , notic@@ ing no one else on her feed had pos@@ ted the information , she closed F@@ ace@@ book and opened T@@ wit@@ ter .
a user with the han@@ dle @ T@@ he@@ e@@ P@@ har@@ o@@ ah was being constantly re@@ tw@@ e@@ e@@ ted onto her ti@@ m@@ eline .
the S@@ t@@ . L@@ ou@@ is@@ -@@ area rap@@ per was li@@ ve@@ -@@ tw@@ e@@ et@@ ing the death of Mic@@ ha@@ el Bro@@ wn , an un@@ armed black 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old killed by a white police offic@@ er in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , M@@ o .
he pos@@ ted a picture of Bro@@ wn &apos;s lif@@ eless body stret@@ ched out in the stre@@ et , where it would stay for four hours .
&quot; this is w@@ ild , &quot; Fer@@ re@@ ll thought to her@@ self .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put down her phone only to return later that evening to tw@@ e@@ ets about people gather@@ ing on Can@@ field drive .
there were p@@ ho@@ tos of police tape and people y@@ ell@@ ing , and of a gu@@ y claim@@ ing to be Bro@@ wn &apos;s fa@@ ther holding a sign that read , &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she wat@@ ched a live feed where a police offic@@ er stood in front of a group of protes@@ ters with a bar@@ king do@@ g .
in another v@@ ide@@ o , a different co@@ p , she said , co@@ cked his ri@@ f@@ le and scre@@ am@@ ed , &quot; I &apos;@@ ll kill all you ... animals . &quot;
&quot; &apos; this is not usual , &apos; &quot; Fer@@ re@@ ll rec@@ all@@ ed saying .
&quot; &apos; this is@@ n &apos;@@ t the type of murder that we &apos;@@ ve become used to and can call typical . &apos;
in that moment I felt ch@@ ill@@ s .
I was ang@@ ry and cr@@ ying . &quot;
she boo@@ ked a return flight and went home the next day .
after lan@@ ding at 11 p.m. , she pic@@ ked up her 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old da@@ u@@ ghter from her da@@ d &apos;s house and decided the two of them would head to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened , to Fer@@ re@@ ll and to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on in the following almost three years is the subject of a new docu@@ mentary , &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the@@ a@@ ters A@@ ug@@ . 11 .
it &apos;s a ta@@ le of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and res@@ ili@@ ence from the van@@ tage point of the people who live in the community and pac@@ ked the stre@@ ets demanding answers .
as Fer@@ re@@ ll dro@@ ve to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on with her da@@ u@@ ghter , who was we@@ aring a fl@@ oral d@@ ress and mat@@ ching cro@@ wn , the two re@@ visited a conver@@ sa@@ tion they &apos;@@ d had coun@@ tless times before that morning &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I tau@@ ght you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in ? &quot; she rec@@ all@@ ed saying .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on right now because the police killed an 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y and it was@@ n &apos;@@ t right .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t not take her , &quot; Fer@@ re@@ ll said later .
&quot; this happening today is a cul@@ min@@ ation of ... that has happened in the past .
she needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
she needs to be well developed in the area of not just acti@@ vis@@ m and organ@@ iz@@ ing but knowing the different la@@ yers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;@@ m for@@ tunate enough to provide her an experience where she do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t personally experience bla@@ tant racism , she is no different than the next black w@@ om@@ an@@ -@@ child .
I feel like I would be doing her a dis@@ service to shi@@ el@@ d her from that . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on was on South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t Ro@@ ad , a site across from the police depart@@ ment that became a ca@@ mp@@ ground of sor@@ ts as the acti@@ vis@@ ts aw@@ ai@@ ted word of O@@ ffic@@ er D@@ ar@@ r@@ en W@@ il@@ son &apos;s even@@ tual non@@ -@@ indic@@ tment .
there Fer@@ re@@ ll and her da@@ u@@ ghter linked up with a local business ow@@ ner who was making sa@@ ck lun@@ ches .
they prepared b@@ ag@@ s and helped pass them out to protes@@ ters .
slowly , a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ re@@ ll .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m completely trans@@ formed after A@@ ug@@ . 9 , &quot; she said , no@@ ting that while an under@@ gra@@ d at the Uni@@ versity of M@@ is@@ sou@@ ri@@ -@@ S@@ t . L@@ ou@@ is , she was president of the Min@@ ority stud@@ ent nur@@ ses As@@ s@@ n@@ . and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organ@@ iz@@ ing .
it all just came . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ re@@ ll met S@@ ab@@ a@@ ah F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co@@ -@@ direc@@ tors , during an evening demonstration .
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an said she and her direc@@ tor of p@@ ho@@ to@@ graphy Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o@@ -@@ F@@ ar@@ ra@@ r &quot; just wanted to document &quot; what was happening .
a question came to Fer@@ re@@ ll &apos;s mind : &quot; do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
that s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ ism was informed by coun@@ tless ins@@ tances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and res@@ ili@@ ence .
as F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an explained in a recent inter@@ view , &quot; We had heard that people who are born and raised in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on were not having their vo@@ ices cen@@ tered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an had already linked up with co@@ -@@ direc@@ tor D@@ am@@ on D@@ av@@ is , an area artis@@ t known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around death row in@@ ma@@ tes .
his involvement ende@@ ared Fer@@ re@@ ll to the project , along with six other loc@@ als the &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? &quot; team followed in the years after Bro@@ wn &apos;s sho@@ ot@@ ing .
&quot; this docu@@ mentary is not some@@ body speaking for us or speaking to us , it &apos;s us speaking , &quot; D@@ av@@ is said .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that &apos;s how I will be represented . &quot;
while the goal was@@ n &apos;@@ t to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll &apos;s experience - in an effort to show that the movement is &quot; not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community coming together , &quot; F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an said - she proved to be the most open of the film &apos;s participants .
as a result , &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? &quot; documents surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll &apos;s life , like falling in love and mar@@ r@@ ying her wi@@ fe .
&quot; I felt like I was na@@ ked , &quot; said Fer@@ re@@ ll , lau@@ gh@@ ing about the first time she saw the finished product .
&quot; but I understood that with doing this work and human@@ iz@@ ing black fol@@ ks , there has to be a level of vulner@@ ability . &quot;
moreover , Fer@@ re@@ ll &apos;s story reite@@ rates and re@@ -@@ cen@@ ters the role of black qu@@ e@@ er women in the broader B@@ lack lives matter movement .
two of the movement &apos;s three foun@@ ders - who co@@ ined # Bla@@ ck@@ L@@ iv@@ es@@ M@@ at@@ ter on social media in the after@@ ma@@ th of the 20@@ 12 killing of black teen Tra@@ y@@ von Martin - identify as qu@@ e@@ er .
&quot; black qu@@ e@@ er women in leadership has sustained the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ re@@ ll , &quot; and that &apos;s because we &apos;@@ re constantly at battle on multi@@ ple fron@@ ts .
black qu@@ e@@ er women have to bear the br@@ un@@ t of it all . &quot;
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an agreed no@@ ting that &quot; the movement is really up@@ held by black women and a lot of qu@@ e@@ er black women . &quot;
she ins@@ ists , however , that &quot; this is not some affir@@ ma@@ tive action type of thing &quot; where Fer@@ re@@ ll was chosen as the film &apos;s heart because of her id@@ entities .
&quot; she was the person who was g@@ al@@ van@@ iz@@ ing this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coinc@@ idence though she was on the front lines , because living life at those inter@@ sections as a black qu@@ e@@ er woman , you have so much on the line .
you can feel her energy through the scre@@ en . &quot;
meanwhile , back in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the news ca@@ mer@@ as are long gone but fra@@ u@@ ght ra@@ cial ties between the community and police persis@@ t .
Fer@@ re@@ ll is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ more years for bloc@@ king a hi@@ gh@@ way during a demonstration .
she descri@@ bes the soci@@ o@@ -@@ political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
still , she cl@@ ings to a ch@@ ant she &apos;s committed to memor@@ y since taking to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on &apos;s stre@@ ets a full three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose but our cha@@ ins . &quot;
a becoming res@@ emb@@ lan@@ ce : artis@@ t creates por@@ tra@@ its using C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s D@@ N@@ A
in the cen@@ ter of the room at New York &apos;s Frid@@ man G@@ all@@ ery are multi@@ ple faces - white , black and bro@@ wn , each bearing an almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble res@@ emb@@ lan@@ ce to one another - suspended on wi@@ res from the ceiling .
the 30 por@@ tra@@ its were created by the artis@@ t He@@ a@@ ther De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g from che@@ ek sw@@ ab@@ s and ha@@ ir cli@@ pp@@ ings sent to her by C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing .
man@@ ning sent the cli@@ pp@@ ings from the For@@ t Le@@ a@@ ven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analys@@ t was ser@@ ving a 3@@ 5@@ -@@ year sentence after f@@ am@@ ously lea@@ king classi@@ fied diplomatic c@@ ab@@ les through the web@@ site W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ a@@ ks .
the new ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , which opened on 2 August , is tit@@ led A becoming res@@ emb@@ lan@@ ce .
it &apos;s the product of two years of cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ence between De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose discipline comb@@ ines her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ ann@@ ing , a trans woman and pi@@ one@@ ering dis@@ sid@@ ent whose sentence was com@@ mu@@ ted by Bar@@ ac@@ k Ob@@ ama when he had just three days left in office .
by al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ ically an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ing D@@ N@@ A ex@@ trac@@ ted from M@@ ann@@ ing and using it to create 30 por@@ tra@@ its of what someone with that gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like , De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g has created a tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ant , if somewhat cer@@ eb@@ ral , com@@ mentary on not only the ma@@ ll@@ e@@ ability of D@@ N@@ A data - the many ways it can be interpreted , and the inherent deter@@ minis@@ m of those interpre@@ tations - but also identity .
man@@ ning , who was born Bra@@ d@@ ley E@@ d@@ ward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , was convic@@ ted in 20@@ 13 on 20 charges , including six es@@ pi@@ on@@ age Act violations , computer fraud and the@@ ft .
from prison , her image was re@@ pressed , so much so that there was just one p@@ ho@@ to - a gran@@ ular , bla@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white sel@@ fi@@ e in which M@@ ann@@ ing , visi@@ bly une@@ as@@ y , s@@ its in a dri@@ ver &apos;s seat we@@ aring a pla@@ tin@@ um b@@ l@@ on@@ de wi@@ g - with which she became associated .
in 20@@ 15 , De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g was coming off the massive success of her 20@@ 12 project , str@@ ang@@ er v@@ isions .
in it , the artis@@ t produced por@@ tra@@ its of str@@ ang@@ ers from for@@ ensi@@ c ar@@ ti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette bu@@ t@@ ts and che@@ wing gu@@ m , ex@@ trac@@ ting D@@ N@@ A from the det@@ r@@ it@@ us to con@@ j@@ ure an image of what these fol@@ ks might look like .
that was when she received an e@@ mail from Paper M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine .
&quot; they were conduc@@ ting an inter@@ view with C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of por@@ tra@@ it to ac@@ company that article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g explained at a press pre@@ view of the new ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition .
and she cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be visited and she cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed at that time , so they reached out to C@@ hel@@ sea and asked if she &apos;@@ d be interested in having a D@@ N@@ A por@@ tra@@ it made .
the artis@@ t and her inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ likely p@@ en pal@@ s , ex@@ changing several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic book , sup@@ pressed I@@ ma@@ ges , illustra@@ ted by S@@ ho@@ il@@ i K@@ an@@ un@@ go , that en@@ visi@@ on@@ ed a future where the president would com@@ mu@@ te C@@ hel@@ sea &apos;s sentence and she &apos;@@ d be able to see the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition in person .
that Ob@@ ama would indeed call for M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of ser@@ en@@ di@@ pity after seven bru@@ tal years at a military prison in K@@ an@@ sa@@ s .
there &apos;s also something profound and powerful about the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition opening now , as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp wages war on government le@@ ak@@ ers and trans@@ gender troops while finding new , tw@@ e@@ e@@ table ways to further inf@@ la@@ me the star@@ k div@@ isions he &apos;s been called on to men@@ d .
when asked about the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ti@@ ming of it all , De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said that &quot; things happen for a reason . &quot;
in an artis@@ t statement written on the gall@@ ery &apos;s wall , M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s super@@ -@@ sized sig@@ nature below it ( the &quot; i &quot; in her last name d@@ ot@@ ted with a heart ) , called for an end to the &quot; automatic fac@@ tion@@ alism that gender , race , sex@@ u@@ ality , and culture have been the basis of . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ al D@@ N@@ A sequ@@ ence - a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de of C@@ s and G@@ s and A@@ s , written in pen@@ ci@@ l .
by including the 200 letters ( or n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , per the artis@@ t &apos;s sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated scientific le@@ x@@ ic@@ on ) , De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g hoped to illustra@@ te how as@@ t@@ oun@@ d@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ma@@ ke@@ up , we all are .
&quot; what I &apos;@@ m hoping that people will take away from this is that our gen@@ ome do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t care about who we are , and how open genetic data is to interpretation , how sub@@ jective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose 2007 v@@ ide@@ o work , s@@ pu@@ rious memor@@ ies , is also on dis@@ play .
&quot; D@@ N@@ A data can tell so many different stor@@ ies , so this is 30 of those stor@@ ies . &quot;
the final piece in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , which is contained in a single room , is one page from the a@@ fore@@ mentioned graphic no@@ ve@@ lla .
it shows M@@ ann@@ ing , emerging , K@@ ing K@@ ong@@ -@@ es@@ que , from the United States D@@ isi@@ pl@@ in@@ ary bar@@ rac@@ ks with a spe@@ a@@ ker@@ phone in hand .
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , then they &apos;@@ ve won , &quot; it read@@ s .
&quot; so never sh@@ ut up . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; the artis@@ t , who ha@@ ils from P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia , said .
&quot; I get go@@ os@@ e@@ bu@@ mps still talking about it . &quot;
man@@ ning has@@ n &apos;@@ t seen the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition in@@ -@@ person yet - as was so pres@@ ci@@ ently imag@@ ined in the com@@ ic book - but when she does , she &apos;@@ ll be gre@@ e@@ ted in the cen@@ ter of the room by the mas@@ ks , her own gen@@ om@@ ic si@@ mu@@ la@@ cr@@ a con@@ g@@ reg@@ ated like h@@ ord@@ es of protes@@ ters .
that was pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful , too , as is everything in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , down to the he@@ ight ( 5 &quot; 2 , M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s sta@@ ture ) at which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written in pen@@ ci@@ l .
&quot; in the past , I &apos;@@ ve had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a cro@@ w@@ d , &quot; De@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said of the por@@ tra@@ its .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with C@@ hel@@ sea , like the movement that was behind fre@@ eing her as well . &quot;
nor@@ th@@ western Pro@@ f@@ essor and O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity employe@@ e wanted for hom@@ ic@@ ide
a nation@@ wide man@@ hun@@ t is underway for a nor@@ th@@ western Uni@@ versity prof@@ essor and an O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity employe@@ e who are wanted as sus@@ pects after a man was found fa@@ tally sta@@ b@@ bed inside a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y Ch@@ ic@@ ago a@@ part@@ ment , police said .
on Monday , fir@@ st@@ -@@ degree murder warran@@ ts without b@@ ai@@ l were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them , 42 , and An@@ drew W@@ ar@@ r@@ en , 56 , for their alleg@@ ed involvement in the death of T@@ r@@ ent@@ on H@@ . J@@ ames Cor@@ ne@@ ll@@ -@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , Co@@ o@@ k Coun@@ ty court recor@@ ds show .
the documents say Cor@@ ne@@ ll@@ -@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , 26 , died after being sta@@ b@@ bed multi@@ ple times .
a community al@@ ert released by the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment says the body was discovered on July 27 .
officers received a call and arrived at the G@@ r@@ and P@@ la@@ z@@ a a@@ part@@ ments and found the victim with several la@@ cer@@ ations on his body .
Cor@@ ne@@ ll@@ -@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u was pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced dead on the sc@@ ene and dete@@ c@@ tives are investig@@ ating the sta@@ b@@ bing as a hom@@ ic@@ ide while police actively search for the two sus@@ pects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associ@@ ate prof@@ essor of mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ology and im@@ mun@@ ology at nor@@ th@@ western Uni@@ versity since 2007 .
Al@@ an K@@ . C@@ ub@@ b@@ age , the vice president for university relations , said in an e@@ ma@@ iled statement that La@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering nor@@ th@@ western Uni@@ versity ca@@ mp@@ uses .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities , and nor@@ th@@ western Uni@@ versity is co@@ operating in that investigation , &quot; C@@ ub@@ b@@ age said .
W@@ ar@@ r@@ en is a senior t@@ reas@@ ur@@ y assis@@ tant at O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for the university and Som@@ er@@ vi@@ lle Coll@@ ege said in an e@@ ma@@ iled statement that , &quot; We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ating authorities in any way they need . &quot;
the statement added that W@@ ar@@ r@@ en &apos;s colleagues were shoc@@ ked and want him to turn himself in .
chi@@ ef Commun@@ ic@@ ations O@@ ffic@@ er of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Pol@@ ice De@@ part@@ ment An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encoura@@ ges the sus@@ pects to sur@@ ren@@ der to authorities .
&quot; police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts but our efforts to loc@@ ate that are intensi@@ fying , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the sus@@ pects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the G@@ r@@ and P@@ la@@ z@@ a building manag@@ er who had just received a cr@@ y@@ p@@ tic ti@@ p that said something had occurred in a@@ part@@ ment 1@@ 00@@ 8 .
police described the sc@@ ene as very g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27 .
La@@ them and W@@ ar@@ r@@ en were confirmed to be at the building by security ca@@ mer@@ as , he said .
&quot; we believe Pro@@ f@@ essor La@@ th@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team at G@@ r@@ and P@@ la@@ z@@ a released a statement to residents saying , &quot; Pol@@ ice are currently working on the ti@@ m@@ eline and background of the victim and are expl@@ or@@ ing a variety of mo@@ tives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;

a 3@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man was senten@@ ced for his threats to b@@ low up an Islamic boo@@ ks@@ ho@@ p and &quot; kill all the Mus@@ lim@@ s &quot; in London .
the In@@ dependent reported that David M@@ off@@ at@@ t was senten@@ ced , for example , for ag@@ gra@@ vated inten@@ tional harassment .
according to the police , the staff of the boo@@ ks@@ ho@@ p called the police on 23 May ,
as the man had threatened to &quot; b@@ low up the boo@@ ks@@ ho@@ p and kill all the Mus@@ lim@@ s . &quot;
the sus@@ pect left the sh@@ op after making his threats .
M@@ off@@ at@@ t was ap@@ prehen@@ ded when he called the police to report a threat .
the threat did not have anything to do with the events in the boo@@ ks@@ ho@@ p .
&quot; the authorities noticed that M@@ off@@ at@@ t was we@@ aring similar c@@ lo@@ th@@ es to the person sus@@ pected of the events in the boo@@ ks@@ ho@@ p , &quot; stated the police press offic@@ er .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m not anti@@ -@@ Muslim , I &apos;@@ m Ca@@ th@@ olic , &quot; M@@ off@@ at@@ t told the police during inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations .
M@@ off@@ at@@ t was senten@@ ced to 100 hours of un@@ paid community service and to pay legal expenses of G@@ B@@ P 6@@ 20 , or EUR 6@@ 90 , and compensation of G@@ B@@ P 85 , or EUR 95 , to the victims .

&quot; we &apos;@@ ll complete W@@ A@@ DA ro@@ admap in near future &quot; - Russian De@@ pu@@ ty p@@ m M@@ ut@@ ko
Russian De@@ pu@@ ty Prime Minister V@@ ita@@ ly M@@ ut@@ ko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) criteria for the re@@ insta@@ tement of the Russian An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( R@@ U@@ S@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; a certain stage of fulfi@@ lling the road map criteria has been carried out , R@@ U@@ S@@ A@@ DA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ A@@ D ( UK An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing ) .
the W@@ A@@ DA ro@@ admap was up@@ dated in this regard , &quot; M@@ ut@@ ko stated on Thursday .
the p@@ m was commen@@ ting on the second part of W@@ A@@ DA &apos;s Ro@@ admap to Code Com@@ pli@@ ance , which descri@@ bes the criteria for the re@@ insta@@ tement of R@@ U@@ S@@ A@@ DA and which recently published on the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation &apos;s web@@ site .
according to M@@ ut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee &#91; I@@ O@@ C &#93; and W@@ A@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti@@ -@@ dop@@ ing authorities must public@@ ally accept the reported out@@ comes of the W@@ A@@ D@@ A@@ -@@ san@@ c@@ tioned investigation by Can@@ a@@ dian law@@ yer Ric@@ hard Mc@@ L@@ ar@@ en on alleg@@ ed sta@@ te@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
referring to the matter , M@@ ut@@ ko said : &quot; we are conduc@@ ting the investigation , as our anti@@ -@@ dop@@ ing system ad@@ mitted a failure .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state progra@@ ms , and we will not admit something that d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t exist . &quot;
M@@ ut@@ ko &apos;s words ec@@ ho@@ ed those of V@@ ita@@ ly S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v , the head of Russia &apos;s In@@ dependent Public An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Commission .
talking to Russian out@@ let R@@ Sport earlier in the day , S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v ad@@ mitted past problems in Russian anti@@ -@@ dop@@ ing bodies , but added : &quot; we have said on numerous occasions , that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one plans to accept this report un@@ cond@@ itionally , &quot; S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ U@@ S@@ A@@ DA was suspended from carrying out dop@@ ing controls within Russia by W@@ A@@ DA in November 20@@ 15 in the wake of the dop@@ ing scandal .
it was , however , permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ A@@ D ) this June .
following a visit to the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation &apos;s head@@ quarters in Moscow in July , W@@ A@@ DA Direc@@ tor General O@@ li@@ vi@@ er N@@ ig@@ g@@ l@@ i stated that R@@ U@@ S@@ A@@ DA is &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be re@@ insta@@ ted .
British organisation scep@@ tical about bel@@ ov@@ ed Finnish innovation : &quot; no evidence &quot; of health benefits of ma@@ tern@@ ity package
a British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish ma@@ tern@@ ity packa@@ ges .
B@@ B@@ C and Gu@@ ar@@ dian , among others , report that Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust , a char@@ itable organisation aiming to prevent une@@ x@@ pected deaths in inf@@ an@@ cy , for@@ b@@ ids the use of its bro@@ c@@ hu@@ res in ma@@ tern@@ ity packa@@ ges handed over in the UK .
distribu@@ ting ma@@ tern@@ ity packa@@ ges to all pregn@@ ant women will start this month in Scotland .
packa@@ ges will also be distributed in some parts of England .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust , there is no evidence that the ma@@ tern@@ ity package reduced the risk of sud@@ den inf@@ ant death ,
a medical condition where a ba@@ by dies suddenly for no obvious reason .
Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust acts as an expert for health authorities in the UK in terms of a safe night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep for children .
&quot; we no longer permit our official bro@@ c@@ hu@@ res to be included in ma@@ tern@@ ity packa@@ ges , as this would mean that we are in favour of this product , &quot; the organisation announced .
Finland has one of the lowest child mor@@ tality rates in the world , only two deaths per 1@@ ,@@ 000 bir@@ ths .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust , this low rate results from many reasons , such as the low number of teen rap@@ es .
&quot; han@@ ding out one package for each family may be a factor .
however , this cannot be said for certain , &quot; says Fran@@ c@@ ine B@@ ates , Chi@@ ef Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive of Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust .
&quot; we are concerned that ma@@ tern@@ ity packa@@ ges are mar@@ ke@@ ted as products that reduce child mor@@ tality and sud@@ den inf@@ ant deaths . &quot;
the ma@@ tern@@ ity package is a Finnish innovation , and it has been distributed to all Finnish mo@@ thers free of charge for 80 years .
the package contains various products , such as ba@@ by c@@ lo@@ th@@ es .
this year &apos;s package contains 53 different products .
the package itself is a car@@ d@@ board box in which bab@@ ies can s@@ le@@ ep .
according to the Scot@@ t@@ ish Government , the bo@@ xes distributed in Scotland fulfil all safety standards .
Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust says that there is no safety standard set for car@@ d@@ board bo@@ xes acting as b@@ eds .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ rust , the package may be the best option for a place to s@@ le@@ ep if no b@@ ass@@ in@@ et or cri@@ b is available .
the organisation only recommen@@ ds the package for N@@ A@@ Ps and advis@@ es that its use should be stopped when the ba@@ by is able to turn to their side .
in addition , the organisation recommen@@ ds that pet@@ s be kept away from the package and that it is not allowed to get di@@ r@@ ty or w@@ et .
F@@ le@@ et@@ -@@ fo@@ oted tor@@ to@@ is@@ e escap@@ ed again from a Jap@@ an@@ ese z@@ o@@ o
staff at a Jap@@ an@@ ese z@@ o@@ o looking for an escap@@ ed tor@@ to@@ is@@ e .
the quic@@ k@@ ness of the gi@@ ant tor@@ to@@ is@@ e has taken the staff by surprise , as the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e made its second escape in two weeks .
the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e escap@@ ed from the S@@ hi@@ bu@@ ka@@ w@@ a z@@ o@@ o located in O@@ ka@@ y@@ ama in western Japan on Tuesday morning .
the security fo@@ ota@@ ge shows that the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e escap@@ ed through the main entr@@ ance .
&quot; it won &apos;@@ t die quickly because it &apos;@@ ll e@@ at grass around the z@@ o@@ o , but we are very concerned , &quot; says Y@@ os@@ h@@ im@@ i Y@@ a@@ man@@ e , a z@@ o@@ o employe@@ e .
the escap@@ ed 3@@ 5@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old tor@@ to@@ is@@ e is female , w@@ eigh@@ s 55 k@@ g and is about 1 m in length .
Y@@ a@@ man@@ e says that the fu@@ g@@ itive has a qui@@ et and kind nature .
during opening hours , the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e is allowed to move around freely in the z@@ o@@ o .
the z@@ o@@ o has not received any e@@ ye@@ witness accounts of the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e .
the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e made its previous escape two weeks ago .
Y@@ a@@ man@@ e discovered it wal@@ king on a road some 150 m from the z@@ o@@ o .
&quot; I saw it on my way to the z@@ o@@ o .
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues to help me , &quot; Y@@ a@@ man@@ e said .
&quot; it can wal@@ k faster than we could ever imagine . &quot;
the star@@ t@@ -@@ ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ t@@ t wanted to g@@ au@@ ge employe@@ e happ@@ iness at her e@@ -@@ commerce star@@ t@@ -@@ up , but sur@@ ve@@ ys w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t working .
responses were often vague , un@@ helpful or , worse , dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful .
and even if she promised an@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t trust the process .
&quot; it just never had consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ t@@ t , who runs the 7@@ 5@@ -@@ person San Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co e@@ -@@ commerce ha@@ ir care company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed .
so she called in out@@ si@@ ders for help .
a new bre@@ ed of human resources star@@ t@@ -@@ ups is cro@@ pping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
by building and lic@@ ens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of meas@@ uring employe@@ e eng@@ agement , they allow companies to do s@@ na@@ p poll@@ s , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer employees an@@ ony@@ m@@ ity and complaint h@@ ot@@ lines , and in some cases allow wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ w@@ ers to by@@ pass C@@ -@@ su@@ ite execu@@ tives and go straight to the board of direc@@ tors .
&quot; you &apos;@@ ve now got tools such as S@@ tra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit for trac@@ king your health , but where &apos;s the F@@ it@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said J@@ i@@ m Bar@@ net@@ t , co@@ -@@ foun@@ der and chi@@ ef executive of R@@ ed@@ wood C@@ ity star@@ t@@ -@@ up g@@ lin@@ t , whose software an@@ al@@ y@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employe@@ e eng@@ agement .
Er@@ re@@ t@@ t said she gained more in@@ sight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using g@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the s@@ na@@ p sur@@ ve@@ ys and poll@@ s of specific teams , it offers a he@@ at map of the company showing at a g@@ lan@@ ce which units have the most complaints and which manag@@ ers have low approval sco@@ res - allowing her to dr@@ ill down on why .
companies are coming to re@@ ali@@ ze they must stay on top of their workplace culture , l@@ est they become the next U@@ ber , which has been en@@ mes@@ hed in scandal since a former employe@@ e published a blo@@ g post descri@@ bing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished .
for star@@ t@@ -@@ ups such as g@@ lin@@ t , this desire for over@@ sight is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18@@ .@@ 7 billion by 20@@ 20 , according to finance te@@ ch insi@@ ghts web@@ site L@@ et &apos;s talk payments .
D@@ en@@ ver , Col@@ o . , star@@ t@@ -@@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and dete@@ ct bad beha@@ vi@@ or , saw an up@@ tic@@ k in interest and activity earlier this year a@@ mid U@@ ber &apos;s fall into dis@@ repu@@ te .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 cli@@ ents , including A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b , Mic@@ ro@@ soft , and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a cli@@ ent .
like g@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent l@@ ets companies send custom@@ iz@@ ed &quot; pul@@ se &quot; sur@@ ve@@ ys , ga@@ ther conf@@ id@@ ential responses in real time , and view he@@ at ma@@ ps of its problem areas .
it also offers an an@@ ony@@ m@@ ous tex@@ ting h@@ ot@@ line that l@@ ets employees report bad beha@@ vi@@ or .
and if the chi@@ ef executive is implic@@ ated , complaints go straight to the board of direc@@ tors .
&quot; the court of public opinion has us@@ ur@@ ped regula@@ tors , &quot; said Pat@@ ric@@ k Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an , the foun@@ der and chi@@ ef executive of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found to treat its employees poor@@ ly or be@@ have une@@ th@@ ically , even if regula@@ tors don &apos;@@ t step in , it can face cos@@ tly consequences from consumer bo@@ y@@ cot@@ ts , employe@@ e at@@ tr@@ ition and law@@ su@@ its , Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant chain with more than 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 employees across 500 loc@@ ations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate head@@ quarters .
previously , if an employe@@ e wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e@@ mail for corporate head@@ quarters , lo@@ d@@ ge a formal complaint , and hope it was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ating and un@@ comfor@@ table experience , said J@@ ames V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , Ru@@ by Tuesday &apos;s general coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way of trac@@ king employe@@ e complaints .
now that the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , though , problems that were previously hid@@ den from execu@@ tives who s@@ at in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to that hol@@ istic , 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ degree view into the employment experience , &quot; said V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , who over@@ sees Ru@@ by Tuesday &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we &apos;@@ re protecting our shareholders from employment l@@ iti@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
companies started taking ethics , values and employe@@ e eng@@ agement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Ar@@ th@@ u@@ r Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations from the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an said .
but it was@@ n &apos;@@ t until &quot; social media came into its own &quot; that companies re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t stop their di@@ r@@ ty la@@ un@@ dr@@ y from going vi@@ ral on@@ line .
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both g@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service , charging companies rec@@ urr@@ ing fe@@ es to use their products .
it &apos;s a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have pro@@ pped up both star@@ t@@ -@@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire ven@@ tures and T@@ ola C@@ ap@@ ital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 47 million .
g@@ lin@@ t secu@@ red $ 10 million in November from B@@ es@@ se@@ mer V@@ en@@ ture Par@@ t@@ ners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments hardly come as a surprise , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there &apos;s a growing body of research showing today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ ic@@ on V@@ alle@@ y , high salaries and interesting projects are merely table sta@@ k@@ es .
employees want to feel that they &apos;@@ re accepted and valu@@ ed and that they &apos;@@ re giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be at a company , feel their vo@@ ices are heard , and that the work they are doing is re@@ war@@ ding , they are more committed to making that company successful , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ een , vice president of global benefits and employe@@ e experience at L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve re@@ turns when their port@@ fol@@ io companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged .
if thir@@ d@@ -@@ party an@@ al@@ y@@ tics tools promise to increase employe@@ e commitment and eng@@ agement , it &apos;s no wonder they &apos;@@ re finding backing .
having data on employe@@ e eng@@ agement is important , according to workplace culture experts .
but the data are us@@ eless unless a company &apos;s cus@@ to@@ di@@ ans take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for their feed@@ back , it can set an expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if change do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t come fast enough , or at all , it can bre@@ ed disappointment and make employees dis@@ engaged .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re going to ask for 4@@ ,@@ 000 suggestions , you need to be prepared to have 4@@ ,@@ 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , president of consul@@ ting at business management firm K@@ ot@@ ter International , who has seen companies make the mistake of re@@ lying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if you don &apos;@@ t follow through , employees will wonder , &apos; did you really hear me ?
do you care ?
and if you don &apos;@@ t care , why should I care ? &apos; &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which now does mon@@ thly employe@@ e sur@@ ve@@ ys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on g@@ lin@@ t , according to Er@@ re@@ t@@ t .
and , after gather@@ ing feed@@ back from employees frustra@@ ted by the speed of decisi@@ on@@ -@@ making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organ@@ iz@@ e several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
over at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is getting new in@@ sight on its employees , and it &apos;s hoping that in the long run , this will conver@@ t to better re@@ tention of workers in an industry known for high tur@@ no@@ ver .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you &apos;@@ re going to lose people , &quot; V@@ it@@ ran@@ o said .
&quot; and if you lose people , you &apos;@@ re going to lose customers .
and when you lose customers , you &apos;@@ re going to lose companies . &quot;
T@@ T news agency reports that a 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man is sus@@ pected of taking v@@ ide@@ os of his na@@ ked neigh@@ bour without her consent in Sweden .

the star@@ t@@ led woman ran into another room to put some c@@ lo@@ th@@ es on .
when she returned to check the situation , the mobile phone was first pu@@ lled up but quickly low@@ ered down again .
the 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old sus@@ pect ad@@ mitted that he took a v@@ ide@@ o of the woman .
however , he claimed that he was only sho@@ ot@@ ing her face .
the v@@ ide@@ o was dele@@ ted and the police was unable to rec@@ over it as evidence .
during inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations , the man ad@@ mitted to sho@@ ot@@ ing the v@@ ide@@ o , but denied being guilty of any crime .
when asked why he took the v@@ ide@@ o , the man said that he &apos;s &quot; cra@@ z@@ y &quot; in love with his neigh@@ bour .
according to T@@ T , the man will be indic@@ ted .
teachers demand more money during autumn negotiations
O@@ ll@@ i L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen , president of the Trade Union of Education ( O@@ A@@ J ) , said on Thursday that the development of salaries cannot be lower than , for example , in the exports industry .
he points out that temporary cuts in holid@@ ay pay in the public sector emphasise this difference .
&quot; we are not able to make deals in which these holid@@ ay pay cuts were not included in one way or another . &quot;
in the munic@@ ip@@ al sector , agreements are only possible after similar agreements have been signed in the private sector and any increases in them are known .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen estimates that O@@ A@@ J will reach an agreement on employment terms in January .
he is still to reve@@ al his targeted increase rates .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen is also the president of the negotiation Organisation for Public Sec@@ tor professionals ( J@@ U@@ K@@ O ) .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen : holid@@ ay pay cuts increase differences in income development
according to O@@ A@@ J , statistics and estimates indicate that the purch@@ asing power of public sector employees will decreas@@ e , while that of private sector employees will increase .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen says that temporary holid@@ ay pay cuts increase these differences further .
Finland should define how many students a single teac@@ her can have
O@@ A@@ J also points out that equality must be ensured in basic education , as differences between the best and worst students are continu@@ ously increasing .
according to O@@ A@@ J , learning results are decreas@@ ing and differences between individuals and regions are increasing .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimin@@ ation of tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices makes for a long day for the B@@ ru@@ ins
it &apos;s pus@@ hing 11 p.m. as a th@@ r@@ ong of UC@@ L@@ A football players l@@ ing@@ er to ch@@ at on one side of the team &apos;s new on@@ -@@ cam@@ pus practice fields .
some have pe@@ el@@ ed off their j@@ er@@ se@@ y to@@ ps , reve@@ aling backs s@@ lic@@ k with s@@ we@@ at from the to@@ i@@ l of the first day of training cam@@ p .
for a good ch@@ un@@ k of the team , these id@@ le minutes constitute a mid@@ day break .
players en@@ ro@@ lled in summer classes will head back to their dor@@ ms after the thre@@ e@@ -@@ hour practice to study for final ex@@ a@@ ms before returning to the W@@ asser@@ man F@@ o@@ ot@@ ball C@@ enter for meetings at 6 : 30 the following morning .
&quot; this is a g@@ rin@@ d for these gu@@ ys the next three days , &quot; B@@ ru@@ ins co@@ ach J@@ i@@ m Mor@@ a said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimin@@ ation of tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices , designed to li@@ gh@@ ten the lo@@ ad on players , has actually l@@ eng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until fin@@ als end Friday .
that &apos;s why UC@@ L@@ A &apos;s first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to accommo@@ date players &apos; already cra@@ mm@@ ed sche@@ d@@ ules .
the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off from no tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days is more one@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days , the B@@ ru@@ ins pus@@ hing up the start of cam@@ p nearly a week from last se@@ as@@ on and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six se@@ as@@ ons in W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood .
they are scheduled to hold 18 practices through A@@ ug@@ . 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their op@@ en@@ er against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M on Sep@@ t .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if it did add another item to players &apos; bus@@ y it@@ in@@ er@@ aries .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re putting this enormous lo@@ ad on them for three or four days and it &apos;s very challeng@@ ing , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they &apos;@@ ve just pus@@ hed through it ; they g@@ rin@@ d , they &apos;@@ re great kid@@ s .
I think once we get to Sa@@ tur@@ day and we &apos;@@ ll have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
UC@@ L@@ A will close its practices once cam@@ p is finished , no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent par@@ king lot and the ad@@ joining L@@ us@@ kin C@@ enter , an up@@ scale ho@@ te@@ l that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ ball@@ s that cle@@ ared a protec@@ tive net behind a go@@ al@@ post .
B@@ ru@@ ins players are scheduled to occup@@ y the ho@@ te@@ l beginning this weekend , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be an issue once those ro@@ oms are va@@ c@@ ant during the se@@ as@@ on .
&quot; we will have security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; that is a real concern and it &apos;s not far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched to think that people can r@@ ent a room and sit up there and v@@ ide@@ ota@@ pe a practice .
if you have v@@ ide@@ ota@@ pe of a practice , it &apos;s a pre@@ tty good deal .
but we &apos;@@ ll have security there and we &apos;@@ ll have security up in par@@ king L@@ ot 8 .
we &apos;@@ ll do the best we can with what we got .
I &apos;@@ m not going to wor@@ ry too much about it .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
freedom in R@@ wan@@ da
a presidential election will be held in R@@ wan@@ da in central Africa on Friday with little doubt over the w@@ inner .
P@@ aul K@@ ag@@ a@@ me is officially aiming for his third term but , in practice , he has had his say in leading the country since 1994 .
that was when the R@@ wan@@ d@@ an Pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tic F@@ ron@@ t ( R@@ P@@ F ) stopped the genocide organised by Hu@@ t@@ u extremis@@ ts .
the R@@ P@@ F was led by K@@ ag@@ a@@ me .
K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has been criticised , for example , for cr@@ us@@ hing the opposition and limiting freedom of speech .
he has also been accused of distor@@ ting poverty statistics .
K@@ ag@@ a@@ me is able to run for his third term because the constitution , limiting the presidency to two terms , was amended .
however , K@@ ag@@ a@@ me is a truly liked leader in R@@ wan@@ da .
during his presidency , social reforms have been made and international investments have flo@@ wn into the country .
what is more , K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has played an important part in uni@@ fying the country divided by the genocide .
the success of R@@ wan@@ da has made many Afric@@ ans doubt whether a liberal multi@@ -@@ party democracy is the right way for African states .
however , K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has promised more freedom for R@@ wan@@ d@@ ans once the country is back on its fe@@ et .
now would be a good time to start .
F@@ ace@@ book to step up fac@@ t@@ -@@ chec@@ king in fight against fa@@ ke news
F@@ ace@@ book is to send more potential ho@@ a@@ x articles to thir@@ d@@ -@@ party fact chec@@ kers and show their findings below the original post , the world &apos;s largest on@@ line social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so@@ -@@ called fa@@ ke news .
the company said in a statement on its web@@ site it will start using up@@ dated mach@@ ine learning to dete@@ ct possible ho@@ a@@ xes and send them to fact chec@@ kers , potentially showing fac@@ t@@ -@@ chec@@ king results under the original article .
F@@ ace@@ book has been critic@@ iz@@ ed as being one of the main distribution points for so@@ -@@ called fa@@ ke news , which many think influ@@ enc@@ ed the 20@@ 16 U@@ .@@ S@@ . presidential election .
the issue has also become a big political topic in Europe , with French voters del@@ u@@ ged with false stor@@ ies ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove ha@@ te@@ ful pos@@ t@@ ings promptly , ahead of elections there in September .
on Thursday F@@ ace@@ book said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fac@@ t@@ -@@ chec@@ king feature was being launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to seeing which stor@@ ies are dispu@@ ted by thir@@ d@@ -@@ party fact chec@@ kers , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sar@@ a S@@ u , F@@ ace@@ book news feed product manag@@ er , in a blo@@ g .
she added that F@@ ace@@ book would keep testing its &quot; related article &quot; feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news .
building a graphic no@@ vel : a Cas@@ t@@ le in England &apos;s story
in its recent past , the dimin@@ u@@ tive Scot@@ ney Cas@@ t@@ le has fea@@ tured in a squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze musi@@ c v@@ ide@@ o and been a b@@ ol@@ th@@ ole for Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ hat@@ ch@@ er during the 19@@ 7@@ 0s and 198@@ 0s .
but Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous history from its cos@@ y seat in Be@@ w@@ l R@@ iver vall@@ e@@ y in K@@ ent , now inspi@@ ration for a graphic no@@ vel written by J@@ a@@ mi@@ e R@@ ho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ -@@ ha@@ ired Y@@ or@@ ks@@ hi@@ re@@ man with a pen@@ ch@@ ant for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beauti@@ ful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wis@@ t@@ fully .
&quot; what a personal connection , to hold that letter in my hand . &quot;
s@@ pan@@ ning the middle ages to the E@@ d@@ war@@ dian era , A Cas@@ t@@ le in England documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney , with each story illustra@@ ted by a different , up@@ coming UK artis@@ t - I@@ sa@@ a@@ c L@@ en@@ ki@@ e@@ w@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ ony May S@@ mit@@ h , W@@ illi@@ am Ex@@ ley , B@@ ec@@ ky Pal@@ mer and I@@ sa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s first book based on an ar@@ chi@@ ve : he also wrote 20@@ 14 &apos;s De@@ ad M@@ en &apos;s te@@ et@@ h and O@@ ther stor@@ ies , a collection inspired by documents in the British Li@@ br@@ ary - a project he found une@@ x@@ pec@@ tedly emo@@ tional .
&quot; I w@@ ell@@ ed up at just the th@@ u@@ mb@@ prin@@ t on the side of a letter , written by a double ag@@ ent in the 17@@ 00@@ s who was working for the J@@ ac@@ ob@@ i@@ tes , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his th@@ u@@ mb@@ prin@@ t !
and letters always s@@ m@@ ell like smo@@ ke because , back then , you li@@ t a fire for light .
to someone 300 years in the future , the s@@ m@@ ell makes it feel like they &apos;@@ re there , too .
ah , I love arch@@ iv@@ es ! &quot;
for someone so s@@ mit@@ ten with old papers , getting support from the National T@@ rust and Ar@@ ts Council England and living in a cas@@ t@@ le for almost four months ( &quot; I over@@ sta@@ yed my welcome a little bit , to be honest &quot; ) seems too good to be true .
R@@ ho@@ des spent his days expl@@ or@@ ing the V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; cas@@ t@@ le , going through the arch@@ iv@@ es and stud@@ ying the man@@ or &apos;s many t@@ reas@@ ures and cu@@ ri@@ os , such as the moun@@ ted hy@@ ena heads on the w@@ all@@ s and bot@@ t@@ les that had spent cen@@ tu@@ ries in the mo@@ at .
he wan@@ dered the grounds and the ru@@ ins of the old cas@@ t@@ le , talking to ran@@ gers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes the artis@@ ts at work on his book &apos;s illustra@@ tions .
then at night , he &apos;@@ d &quot; drin@@ k wh@@ is@@ key and get writing . &quot;
the inti@@ mate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively un@@ known , as the National T@@ rust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final he@@ ir , E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h H@@ us@@ se@@ y , died .
when R@@ ho@@ des arrived a decade later , staff were only starting to tackle the ar@@ chi@@ ve , which he descri@@ bes as &quot; hundreds of years of ar@@ is@@ to@@ c@@ rats going : &apos; O@@ h , stick it in the lo@@ ft &apos; . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the days of the English emp@@ ire , ma@@ ps out@@ lining who ow@@ ned what : &quot; you &apos;@@ d think land disputes would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des , &quot; but there was this one bir@@ ch tre@@ e two families were fighting over .
just let it go , gu@@ ys ! &quot;
some of the stor@@ ies in the collection use the cas@@ t@@ le as a ju@@ mp@@ ing@@ -@@ off point to del@@ ve more broadly into English history , including The L@@ ab@@ ou@@ rer , which follows a man who leaves the new@@ ly built cas@@ t@@ le to join the 13@@ 81 pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; re@@ vol@@ t .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot happening at the cas@@ t@@ le in 13@@ 80 , in this book called the K@@ ni@@ ghtly F@@ am@@ il@@ ies of K@@ ent and S@@ us@@ sex , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; re@@ vol@@ t started in that area and I thought , a ri@@ ot is a good place to start .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stor@@ ies are ro@@ oted firmly in the history of the cas@@ t@@ le - such as The pri@@ est , which tell@@ s the ta@@ le of the J@@ es@@ u@@ it pri@@ est whom the D@@ ar@@ re@@ ll family hi@@ d for seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or The smugg@@ ler , which features 18@@ th@@ -@@ century contra@@ ban@@ der Ar@@ th@@ u@@ r D@@ ar@@ re@@ ll , who is thought to have sta@@ ged his own fun@@ er@@ al by fi@@ lling a co@@ ff@@ in with ro@@ cks ( a discover@@ y made years later when his co@@ ff@@ in was une@@ ar@@ th@@ ed ) .
the D@@ ar@@ re@@ lls are R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s fav@@ our@@ ite Scot@@ ney family : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite ro@@ gu@@ ish , always getting into debt and spending money on things they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t afford .
different generations of D@@ ar@@ re@@ ll men solved their debt crises by mar@@ r@@ ying rich old women - I imagine them as a bun@@ ch of hand@@ some gu@@ ys , with a k@@ n@@ ac@@ k for wo@@ o@@ ing he@@ i@@ res@@ ses . &quot;
with his as@@ sign@@ ment in the cas@@ t@@ le over , R@@ ho@@ des is on the hun@@ t for other sin@@ gu@@ lar writing experiences .
he has completed a tw@@ o@@ -@@ week s@@ tin@@ t in the Finnish w@@ il@@ d@@ ern@@ ess for a graphic no@@ vel about E@@ l@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the site of an early 20@@ th@@ -@@ century san@@ ator@@ ium that has since been rec@@ laim@@ ed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney holds a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to leave , &quot; he says .
&quot; it was like : &apos; ah , I &apos;@@ ve got to go deal with f@@ uc@@ king real life now . &apos; &quot;
worst relations with Russia since the C@@ old War
J@@ ens S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg , NATO Secretary General , commen@@ ted on Thursday that relations between NATO and Russia have become significantly col@@ der .
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg bla@@ med Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine .
&quot; I think it is correct to say that NATO &apos;s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the C@@ old War , &quot; S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg told C@@ N@@ N .
&quot; at the end of the C@@ old War , we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia .
but especially after the illegal anne@@ x@@ ation of C@@ r@@ im@@ ea in 20@@ 14 and the continued Russian destabil@@ isation of eastern Ukraine , the relationship between NATO and Russia has deterior@@ ated considerably . &quot;
according to S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg , NATO is still committed to avoiding a further sp@@ ike in tensions .
&quot; as long as we are strong , as long as we are predic@@ table , we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escal@@ ation and avoid a new C@@ old War . &quot;
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ berg &apos;s remarks came as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all@@ -@@ time and very dangerous low .
tru@@ mp bla@@ med the US Congress for the poor relationship , as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week .
W@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko reti@@ res - no re@@ match against An@@ th@@ ony Jos@@ hu@@ a
L@@ ong@@ -@@ time heav@@ y@@ weight champ@@ ion in professional bo@@ xing W@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko reti@@ res .
U@@ k@@ ra@@ in@@ ian K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko , 41 , announced his retirement on Thursday morning .
g@@ old me@@ d@@ all@@ ist at the Olympic G@@ ames in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta in 1996 , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko had 69 fi@@ ghts as a professional , w@@ inning 64 times .
he held different tit@@ les in 200@@ 0@@ -@@ 2002 and in 200@@ 6@@ -@@ 20@@ 15 .
K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko lost the two last fi@@ ghts of his career .
T@@ ys@@ on fur@@ y be@@ at him by the unanimous decision of the judges in November 20@@ 15 .
in April this year , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko faced An@@ th@@ ony Jos@@ hu@@ a at W@@ emb@@ ley Sta@@ di@@ um and lost the fi@@ er@@ ce fight via technical kno@@ ck@@ out in the 1@@ 1@@ th round .
Jos@@ hu@@ a and K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko were expected to have a re@@ match in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as in November .
however , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko was unable to find moti@@ vation for the fight .
&quot; I deliberately took a few weeks to make my decision , to make sure I had enough distance from the fight at W@@ emb@@ ley Sta@@ di@@ um , &quot; K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko told in his press release .
&quot; as an ama@@ teur and a professional bo@@ x@@ er , I have achieved everything I dre@@ am@@ ed of , and now I want to start my second career after sports .
I would have never imag@@ ined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful bo@@ xing career .
I &apos;@@ m very than@@ k@@ ful for this . &quot;
watch a v@@ ide@@ o of K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s retirement announcement .
K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s manag@@ er B@@ ern@@ d B@@ ö@@ n@@ te told that the decision to reti@@ re was a difficult one .
&quot; but he has always emphasised that he wanted to reti@@ re if he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have enough moti@@ vation an@@ y@@ more .
therefore this is defin@@ iti@@ vely the right decision , &quot; B@@ ö@@ n@@ te said .
since 200@@ 9 , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko has been with American ac@@ t@@ ress Ha@@ y@@ den P@@ an@@ et@@ ti@@ er@@ e .
they have one child , Ka@@ ya , born in 20@@ 14 .
K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s older bro@@ ther Vi@@ tal@@ i is also a former heav@@ y@@ weight champ@@ ion .
in 200@@ 8@@ -@@ 20@@ 12 , the two bro@@ thers domin@@ ated international bo@@ xing by holding the tit@@ les of different bo@@ xing feder@@ ations at the same time .
Finnish wea@@ ther g@@ ru@@ mp is down with the conditions : &quot; it spo@@ ils the mo@@ od &quot;
pol@@ e va@@ ul@@ ter M@@ inn@@ a N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en has suffered from the wea@@ ther conditions during this summer se@@ as@@ on .
M@@ inn@@ a N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en has had problems with the wea@@ ther conditions .
the win@@ d and cold wea@@ ther have got N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en down .
un@@ stable conditions are also expected for the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in London .
M@@ inn@@ a N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en is talking about the wea@@ ther .
this summer , wea@@ ther conditions have been against pol@@ e va@@ ul@@ ter M@@ inn@@ a N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en .
&quot; I W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t like to blame the track , but it &apos;s in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable that I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even get my shor@@ ter pol@@ es working properly , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said after her competition in I@@ n@@ n@@ s@@ br@@ uc@@ k .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve compe@@ ted and trained here who knows how many times , and I &apos;@@ ve never seen such changing win@@ ds before , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said during Pa@@ av@@ o N@@ ur@@ mi G@@ ames .
&quot; this se@@ as@@ on , it &apos;s been very hard to ju@@ mp stead@@ ily , as the win@@ ds have been so er@@ ratic , even during practice , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said at K@@ al@@ ev@@ an K@@ is@@ at .
the wea@@ ther was also a ho@@ t topic in London on Thursday .
&quot; it &apos;s been a challenge to keep my techni@@ que in@@ tac@@ t . I don &apos;@@ t know if it &apos;s the cold wea@@ ther or what .
it &apos;s been cold and w@@ ind@@ y , and it has really spo@@ il@@ t the mo@@ od .
there &apos;s no point in consum@@ ing energy in bad conditions . &quot;
she reached the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships thanks to ju@@ mp@@ ing 4@@ 55 in@@ doors .
out@@ doors , she has reached 4@@ 45 .
the conditions are not the same for everyone in London .
it is important to stay pati@@ ent and wait for better win@@ ds .
N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en &apos;s goal is to ju@@ mp 4@@ 60 on Friday and make it to the fin@@ als .
why won &apos;@@ t you train abroad ?
&quot; that &apos;s not necessary .
early last se@@ as@@ on , I trained in Italy and Germany .
I got my techni@@ que together and stable .
this year , I probably should have done the same .
normally , I &apos;@@ ve been able to train in@@ doors , but now the facility has been closed . &quot;
what would be ideal wea@@ ther conditions to compete in ?
&quot; the tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture should be 25 degre@@ es .
I don &apos;@@ t mind low win@@ ds , as long as they stay the same . &quot;
experienced former government official criticised politicians for Y@@ le : &quot; we have nothing to distribu@@ te , now or in many years to come &quot;
Er@@ k@@ ki V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en , an experienced government official who prepared budgets in the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance for decades war@@ ns that , despite the positive economic atmosphere , the Government of Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä must keep its co@@ ol and be careful not to increase the state budget with bor@@ ro@@ wed money .
he says that there is nothing to distribu@@ te .
Y@@ le inter@@ viewed V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en , who reti@@ red in 20@@ 15 , in Y@@ k@@ k@@ ö@@ sa@@ am@@ u on Wednesday .
the preparation of next year &apos;s state budget is about to begin .
V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en regards the recent proposals of politicians for increasing the standard pension , decreas@@ ing car taxes and supporting elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ik@@ es as election rhetoric .
they mainly indicate that elections are approac@@ hing . after all , as ten per cent of the state budget is funded by bor@@ ro@@ wing more money , there is nothing to distribu@@ te , now or in many years to come .
V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en told Y@@ le that it is nearly a dec@@ eption to talk about distribu@@ table funds when they are bor@@ ro@@ wed .
he emphasised that all money bor@@ ro@@ wed is something our children have to pay back .
V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en has a long history in preparing state budgets : he started working in the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance in 19@@ 78 as a budget secre@@ tary , and worked since as a de@@ pu@@ ty manag@@ er of the budget depart@@ ment and as a budget manag@@ er .
before his retirement , he worked as the permanent secre@@ tary of the Minis@@ try of Economic Affairs and Employment .
in the Y@@ le inter@@ view , V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en pointed out that the estimated economic growth of three per cent will probably be temporary .
all econom@@ ists estimate that his is only a sp@@ ike , followed by a down@@ ward trend next year , and Finland must expect growth of one per cent for decades .

the draft law is due to be discussed in the two cha@@ m@@ bers of Congress .

the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme .
this new application process will benefit candidates who speak English , have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
sp@@ ouse of the Qu@@ een of Denmark does not want to be bu@@ ried in the same place as the Qu@@ een
P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k does not want to be bu@@ ried with Qu@@ een Mar@@ gre@@ the .
P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k and Qu@@ een Mar@@ gre@@ the p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed in April .
the Danish Ro@@ y@@ al Court said that Qu@@ een Mar@@ gre@@ the of Denmark , 77 , and her sp@@ ouse P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k , 83 , will not be bu@@ ried next to each other .
trad@@ itionally , the ruling cou@@ ples of Denmark have been bu@@ ried in a single location .
in its press release issued on Thursday , the Ro@@ y@@ al Court announced that P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k does not want to be bu@@ ried in the R@@ os@@ kil@@ de Ca@@ th@@ ed@@ ral .
according to B@@ T newspaper , P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k is not satisfied with his role in the ro@@ y@@ al family .
&quot; it &apos;s no secret that the P@@ rin@@ ce has been un@@ happy with his role and title in the Danish mon@@ archy , &quot; L@@ ene B@@ ell@@ e@@ by , press secre@@ tary of the Danish Ro@@ y@@ al Court commen@@ ted in the newspaper .
the P@@ rin@@ ce &apos;s decision not to be bu@@ ried next to the Qu@@ een is a natural consequence of him feeling that he is not treated as an equal to his sp@@ ouse .
according to the Ro@@ y@@ al Court , the Qu@@ een has for long been aware of her sp@@ ouse &apos;s wish regarding his place of bu@@ ri@@ al and under@@ stands his decision .
a moment of hor@@ ro@@ r on the road : nearly hit by a car on the hi@@ gh@@ way
T@@ om@@ mi was driving with his sp@@ ouse and their two small children .
luc@@ kil@@ y , they did not get hur@@ t in the accident , but they will not receive any insurance compensation , unless the counter@@ party can be reached .
the incident took place near K@@ e@@ im@@ ol@@ an@@ por@@ t@@ ti in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a .
ar@@ chi@@ ve p@@ ho@@ to from R@@ ing Ro@@ ad III ro@@ ad@@ work site .
T@@ om@@ mi from V@@ an@@ ta@@ a says it was a mi@@ rac@@ le that their family survi@@ ved the car accident on Tuesday .
T@@ om@@ mi , his sp@@ ouse Ri@@ ina and their two small children were driving on the hi@@ gh@@ way near K@@ e@@ im@@ ol@@ an@@ por@@ t@@ ti in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a towards H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inn@@ a .
T@@ om@@ mi says that a white car was spe@@ eding up on the R@@ ing Ro@@ ad III jun@@ ction about to enter the hi@@ gh@@ way when it nearly hit the side of their car .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , the white car would have hit them if T@@ om@@ mi had not been able to sw@@ er@@ ve to the left .
&quot; I hit the b@@ rak@@ es and sw@@ er@@ ved to the left at the same time - and then I lost control of the car , &quot; T@@ om@@ mi says .
the family &apos;s car hit the medi@@ an bar@@ rier at high speed .
the parents and their two children sitting in the back seat did not get hur@@ t .
one of the children is almost three years old , and the other is under 12 months of age .
&quot; we were really lu@@ ck@@ y not to get hur@@ t .
there were no cars heading our way , even though the place is usually very bus@@ y . &quot;
the accident took place at 5 : 20 p@@ m .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , no car stopped to help them , and the family called 1@@ 12 .
they were able to get out of the car without help .
an amb@@ ul@@ ance and res@@ c@@ ue personnel arrived on site to check the condition of the family members .
the car was dama@@ ged beyond re@@ pair .
T@@ om@@ mi says that he and her sp@@ ouse have a low income and their respective families ch@@ ip@@ ped in to help them buy the car .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , they will not receive any insurance compensation , unless they obtain the details of the other car .
this is why the family hopes that anyone who witnessed the accident come forth and report any information about the other car .
&quot; we need a car every single day .
we can &apos;@@ t take our children to the da@@ y@@ -@@ care centre or go to work without it , &quot; T@@ om@@ mi says .
T@@ om@@ mi saw that the other car was white and a little older ,
probably from the late 199@@ 0s or early 200@@ 0s .
he thinks that the registration number started with S@@ I@@ G .
&quot; if the counter@@ party cannot be ap@@ prehen@@ ded , I don &apos;@@ t know how we can survive financially - we are already in a situation where we need to count every p@@ enn@@ y . &quot;
T@@ om@@ mi hopes that anyone who witnessed the accident or knows something about it contacts the police .
persons contac@@ ted from the I@@ t@@ ä@@ -@@ U@@ u@@ si@@ ma@@ a police depart@@ ment and the K@@ es@@ ki@@ -@@ U@@ u@@ si@@ ma@@ a res@@ c@@ ue depart@@ ment confirm that they were at the accident site on Tuesday evening .
the head@@ line and article were revised at 9 : 15 p@@ m : unlike originally reported , the other car did not drive the other way , but nearly hit the family &apos;s car when entering the hi@@ gh@@ way from a jun@@ ction .
show directed by L@@ ot@@ ta J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen deals with relationships by means of com@@ edy - I@@ t@@ s@@ ens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja will be perfor@@ med at M@@ ik@@ ä ? the@@ at@@ re on Friday and Sa@@ tur@@ day
L@@ ot@@ ta J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen from Kou@@ vol@@ a brings her first the@@ at@@ re production as a direc@@ tor to the M@@ ik@@ ä ? the@@ at@@ re .
I@@ t@@ s@@ ens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja ( Ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition@@ ist ) is a musi@@ cal the@@ at@@ re show about relationships gone bad and insu@@ ffici@@ ency .
Direc@@ tor L@@ ot@@ ta J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen says that it will still make audi@@ ences feel good .
&quot; the them@@ es are dealt with by means of com@@ edy .
we will not w@@ allow in sad emo@@ tions , &quot; J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen says .
according to J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen , the t@@ ouring summer the@@ at@@ re show has been produced with a small budget , but with a big young heart .
the name of the show challenges its audi@@ ences to think what we ex@@ pose of ourselves when we meet new people .
do we play a certain role or do we approach others openly ?
the pl@@ ot@@ less show is a mi@@ x of fact and fic@@ tion .
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen has both directed the show and adapted it for the stage .
she is also in charge of li@@ ghting .
the show consists of texts written by the working group , and there is no p@@ lot .
the direc@@ tor believes that , even though the show gets its inspi@@ ration from young people &apos;s thoughts , it speaks to people of all ages .
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen emphasises that I@@ ten@@ s@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja does not express her own relationships or those of the working group .
&quot; it &apos;s a mi@@ x of fact and fic@@ tion .
I &apos;@@ m sure my values come through from the show .
I &apos;@@ m not thinking that human relations are bad , but I don &apos;@@ t think either that a relationship , especially an inti@@ mate relationship , is the only key to happ@@ iness . &quot;
many learn from their div@@ or@@ ced parents
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen thinks that I@@ t@@ s@@ ens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja dra@@ ws a topical picture of young adul@@ ts living in 1@@ 00@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Finland .
she says that many have learned about relationships from their parents , many of whom are div@@ or@@ ced -
at least that it is important to listen to yourself .
there is no need to stay in a relationship that does not work .
the show is perfor@@ med by M@@ ine@@ a L@@ å@@ n@@ g , N@@ ik@@ la@@ s R@@ au@@ t@@ é@@ n and O@@ t@@ to Ro@@ k@@ ka .
C@@ os@@ tu@@ mi@@ er E@@ lla S@@ ne@@ ll@@ man is also part of the working group .
musi@@ c has been arran@@ ged by J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen and Ro@@ k@@ ka .

J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen fel@@ l in love with the the@@ at@@ re during her years in Kou@@ vol@@ a .

Finnish Olympic w@@ inner took one year to rec@@ over from a terrible mo@@ to@@ cross accident - cer@@ v@@ ical sp@@ ine f@@ rac@@ tured
not many Finnish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are the un@@ sto@@ p@@ pa@@ ble force of nature that is J@@ an@@ ne La@@ h@@ tel@@ a .
the sta@@ r mo@@ gu@@ l ski@@ er travell@@ ed around the world hundreds of days for twenty years and ch@@ ased his dream of w@@ inning the Olympic g@@ old me@@ d@@ al .
the dream came true in 2002 , but La@@ h@@ tel@@ a kept going .
he was not only ti@@ re@@ less in training , but also eag@@ er to try new sports .
there are not many sports above ground K@@ e@@ mi@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ vi@@ -@@ based La@@ h@@ tel@@ a has not tried at least once .
&quot; it has helped me not to stop .
there &apos;s always something new , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
in the end , one sport nearly stopped La@@ h@@ tel@@ a for good .
in 20@@ 14 , he was in a mo@@ to@@ cross accident ,
where he suffered a cer@@ v@@ ical f@@ rac@@ ture and bro@@ ke both of his arms .
&quot; I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t work anywhere .
I lic@@ ked my w@@ ounds at home for a year , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
there was also bad lu@@ ck involved .
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a also ad@@ m@@ its that his age might have had something to do with the accident .
&quot; rid@@ ing a mo@@ to@@ cross b@@ ike may seem w@@ ild .
but I was@@ n &apos;@@ t trying to find any limits .
it &apos;s just such a tough sport that it &apos;s too much for a for@@ ty year old like me ! &quot;
after the accident , La@@ h@@ tel@@ a was in an un@@ usual situation .
his active life came to a full stop .
he had recently returned from a long s@@ tin@@ t as the head co@@ ach of the national fre@@ esty@@ le team of Japan .
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a started in this position immediately after his career ended in 2006 .
&quot; I had to stay still for the first time since I turned 15 .
I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t really do anything , &quot; says La@@ h@@ tel@@ a .
when he worked as a co@@ ach , La@@ h@@ tel@@ a often challeng@@ ed his a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in the s@@ lop@@ es and physical condition tests .
&quot; surpris@@ ingly , having to stop was a positive experience .
I was so ti@@ red , both men@@ tally and physi@@ cally , that even my own thoughts d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t seem rational ,
not even those related to the sport .
it felt good to just stop .
I actually enjoyed that I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have to do anything . &quot;
the forced break inspired La@@ h@@ tel@@ a to start as the head co@@ ach of T@@ e@@ am Finland .
if he had not had to stop , he might have bur@@ nt out .
&quot; it &apos;s easier to find parts of my body that have been broken than those that have remained in@@ tac@@ t !
without the accident , I W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have realised that I needed so much rest . &quot;
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a started as the head co@@ ach of the national fre@@ esty@@ le team of Finland a year ago .
at the same time , he found a safer ho@@ b@@ by to replace hi@@ gh@@ -@@ speed sports .
&quot; I replaced mo@@ to@@ cross with dis@@ c g@@ ol@@ f !
it all got out of hand right away .
at worst , I spent seven hours a day thro@@ wing . &quot;
even though La@@ h@@ tel@@ a has always worked hard , he does not demand similar commitment from his a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
&quot; I don &apos;@@ t want to force everyone to be the same .
in our culture , there is room to be yourself and there are many ways to become the best in the world .
as indicated by its name , fre@@ esty@@ le has always been about a free sty@@ le and men@@ tality , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
the rise of sex ro@@ bo@@ ts is real , and we should be concerned
just when you thought 20@@ 17 cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t get any we@@ ir@@ der along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex ro@@ bo@@ t sector .
Y@@ ep .
sex ro@@ bo@@ ts are a big deal right now .
recently , the F@@ oun@@ dation for Res@@ pon@@ sible Rob@@ o@@ tics ( F@@ R@@ R ) released a report looking at the development of sex ro@@ bo@@ ts over the next five to 10 years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ it@@ us prof@@ essor of ro@@ bo@@ tics and artificial intelligence at the Uni@@ versity of S@@ he@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co@@ -@@ foun@@ der of the F@@ R@@ R , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
customers can choose the ro@@ bo@@ t &apos;s eye col@@ our , ni@@ pp@@ le shape and fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il type .
&quot; people s@@ ni@@ gg@@ er about them , but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more , &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said at the launch of the new report .
modern sex doll@@ s have evol@@ ved out of their blo@@ w@@ -@@ up counter@@ parts into ro@@ bo@@ ts with a sil@@ ic@@ on s@@ kin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human@@ -@@ like responses achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; custom@@ ise &quot; their ro@@ bo@@ t to su@@ it their persu@@ asi@@ ons , cho@@ os@@ ing everything from the ro@@ bo@@ t &apos;s eye col@@ our , ni@@ pp@@ le shape to fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il type or col@@ our .
but it gets even more distur@@ bing , with many of the ro@@ bo@@ ts poss@@ essing &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would make a Ste@@ p@@ for@@ d wi@@ fe look progressive .
modern sex doll@@ s have evol@@ ved into ro@@ bo@@ ts with a sil@@ ic@@ on s@@ kin .
the Re@@ al@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x ro@@ bo@@ t , for example , allows users to custom@@ ise their ro@@ bo@@ ts according to the tra@@ its they find appe@@ aling , such as s@@ hy@@ ness .
then there are the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y G@@ old sex ro@@ bo@@ ts , developed by true com@@ pan@@ ion , which come with pre@@ -@@ progra@@ mm@@ ed person@@ alities , including &quot; F@@ rigid F@@ ar@@ ra@@ h &quot; that gives the impression of s@@ hy@@ ness and &quot; W@@ ild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us &quot; person@@ ality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y G@@ old has a person@@ ality which is mat@@ ched as much as possible to your person@@ ality , &quot; the true com@@ pan@@ ion web@@ site en@@ th@@ uses .
so she lik@@ es what you like , dis@@ lik@@ es what you dis@@ like , etc .
she also has mo@@ ods during the day just like real people !
she can be s@@ le@@ ep@@ y , conver@@ sa@@ tional or she can &apos; be in the mo@@ od &apos; ! &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects to the rise of sex ro@@ bo@@ ts - not least of which is the re@@ pla@@ cement of real , human relationships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent female tra@@ its , the ra@@ pe@@ y con@@ no@@ tations of making a move on F@@ rigid ( read : resis@@ tant ) F@@ ar@@ ra@@ h , are the most concerning .
on its web@@ site , true com@@ pan@@ ion lik@@ ened Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y to a vi@@ bra@@ tor , but for men .
&quot; if woman ( si@@ c ) can have a vi@@ bra@@ tor , why can &apos;@@ t men have a Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y ? &quot; the web@@ site states .
however , these sex ro@@ bo@@ ts are not a mere f@@ et@@ ish or just another sex to@@ y .
their emerg@@ ence and increasing sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ation points to something d@@ ar@@ k@@ er and deep@@ er within our culture , a re@@ treat from the ideal of gender equality to@@ ward a desire for sex with sub@@ j@@ ug@@ ation as an op@@ tional add@@ -@@ on .
most men , naturally , are not going to keep sex ro@@ bo@@ ts , and while the F@@ R@@ R noted their increasing popul@@ arity , they remain , for now , on the out@@ s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts of consumer culture .
but what se@@ ep@@ s in from the fr@@ ing@@ es can be highly instruc@@ tive as to the ten@@ or of the era we &apos;@@ re living in .
and many people ar@@ en &apos;@@ t we@@ ir@@ d or off@@ ensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so .
there is little coinc@@ idence that these sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated sex ro@@ bo@@ ts have emerged at a time when women &apos;s rights are under threat across the g@@ lo@@ be , when there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ g@@ ged about sex@@ u@@ ally assa@@ ul@@ ting women .
the most ch@@ ill@@ ing aspect of the TV series The H@@ and@@ ma@@ id &apos;s ta@@ le is@@ n &apos;@@ t the graphic ima@@ ger@@ y , the no@@ os@@ ed bodies and g@@ ou@@ ged eyes , but just how realistic that vision feels .
the Republic of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad is a lea@@ p , but , right now , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t feel like a large one .
the aim behind these sex ro@@ bo@@ ts is to create as much of a physical lik@@ eness to actual women ( albeit with por@@ n sta@@ r propor@@ tions ) as techn@@ olog@@ ically possible .
their cre@@ ators want them to feel human to the touch , for them to m@@ im@@ ic the movement of a real body .
but , poin@@ tedly , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the ro@@ bo@@ ts do not represent real women .
they cannot break up with their com@@ pan@@ ion , or wal@@ k out .
they have no agency or back@@ -@@ story , nothing to suggest independence or anything that may dis@@ rupt the fan@@ tas@@ y of total ser@@ v@@ it@@ ude .
they are pleasant sla@@ ves , in other words .
or to put it into 20@@ 17 par@@ lan@@ ce : hand@@ ma@@ id@@ ens .
police sus@@ pects : two terrorist acts were planned in Australia by group led by IS@@ IS leader
a leader of the terrorist organisation IS@@ IS led a group of A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ian men who are sus@@ pected of planning to take a bom@@ b on board an E@@ ti@@ had A@@ ir@@ ways plan@@ e .
S@@ yd@@ ney Mor@@ ning Her@@ al@@ d reports that one of the leaders of IS@@ IS had also sent parts of a bom@@ b to S@@ yd@@ ney .
according to the sus@@ pects , their intention was to plant the bom@@ b on the plan@@ e on 15 July , but their attempt failed before the security chec@@ k@@ point .
the police have not disc@@ los@@ ed any details of why the attempt failed .
another plan of the sus@@ pected terrorists was to build a mach@@ ine that spre@@ ads a col@@ our@@ less tox@@ ic gas which they would set off in a place full of people , such as a public transport vehicle .
Mic@@ ha@@ el P@@ hel@@ an , a de@@ pu@@ ty commission@@ er of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ian Federal Pol@@ ice , says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia .
due to the plans of sus@@ pected terrorists , four men were ap@@ prehen@@ ded in police ra@@ ids on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
one of the men has been released , but his inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations will also be continued later .
tru@@ mp &apos;s great fe@@ at ?
making Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney seem the e@@ pit@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the tru@@ mp era that the political div@@ isions that have pol@@ ar@@ ised the US electorate have , on a mic@@ ro@@ -@@ scale , tor@@ n families apart .
around Christmas and T@@ han@@ ks@@ giving , newspapers in the US ab@@ ounded with advice c@@ olu@@ m@@ ns on how to deal with the hor@@ ro@@ r of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ -@@ voting rela@@ tives .
we are all sup@@ pos@@ edly stra@@ ining to bur@@ st our fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ b@@ les .
less re@@ marked on is the power of tru@@ mp to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ in , a le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ le@@ an@@ ing po@@ et who lives in Ch@@ ic@@ ago and who &apos;s long been at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads with Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , has been vis@@ iting me in New York this week .
she reminded me that unity against a common en@@ em@@ y can have a powerful effect .
with tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Re@@ public@@ an si@@ b@@ ling she had been b@@ ic@@ ker@@ ing with about politics for decades , is suddenly and pec@@ u@@ li@@ arly on the same side .
around the d@@ inner table this is surely a good thing ; but it strikes me that , in a broader context , it car@@ ries significant risks .
the left has been invi@@ g@@ or@@ ated by tru@@ mp , but the war@@ ping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ards .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tru@@ mp , we are referring to the sc@@ ary possibility that his an@@ tics may one day cease to ap@@ p@@ al .
there is an even sc@@ ari@@ er long@@ -@@ range scenario , however , in which what tru@@ mp &quot; norm@@ alis@@ es &quot; are ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ing Re@@ public@@ ans who , held up against his standards , suddenly seem the e@@ pit@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself actively nos@@ tal@@ gic these days for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s qu@@ ain@@ t version of cra@@ z@@ y - the do@@ g on the car ro@@ of , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both of which , compared to tru@@ mp , seem very mil@@ d offences indeed .
when tru@@ mp goes , the next Re@@ public@@ an candidate will merely have to be san@@ e to quali@@ fy as an im@@ meas@@ ura@@ ble improvement .
while my c@@ ous@@ in was in town , we took our kid@@ s to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Par@@ k , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sel@@ s run by the New York par@@ ks depart@@ ment , and the best three b@@ uc@@ ks you can spend in the city if you don &apos;@@ t require ca@@ ff@@ e@@ ine .
the hor@@ ses are th@@ under@@ ously huge , the fi@@ bre@@ -@@ g@@ las@@ s desig@@ ns on the central cy@@ lin@@ der - all g@@ ur@@ ning c@@ low@@ ns and animals tw@@ is@@ ting to look over their own shoul@@ ders in terror - utterly sin@@ is@@ ter , and the tin@@ kl@@ ing musi@@ c od@@ dly trans@@ porting .
so many of the cl@@ ic@@ hes of a city disap@@ point : views from tal@@ l buildings get old , s@@ ky@@ lines grow too familiar to offer much of a th@@ r@@ ill , and the reality of the city do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t live up to the dream .
Thir@@ ty@@ -@@ five years later and I &apos;@@ m still not entirely over the day I discovered Sw@@ is@@ s c@@ ot@@ ta@@ ge is not , in fact , a Sw@@ is@@ s c@@ ot@@ ta@@ ge - the theme pu@@ b , Y@@ e Ol@@ de Sw@@ is@@ s c@@ ot@@ ta@@ ge , do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t count - but a large ro@@ und@@ about in north London .
the Central Par@@ k car@@ ou@@ sel , however , is still a we@@ ir@@ dly mag@@ ical experience , to the extent that two tw@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old and two women in their 4@@ 0s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given it full marks , but than@@ k@@ fully nobody asked .
in a depart@@ ment stor@@ e this week , on the other hand , I was required , before s@@ wi@@ ping my credit card , to rate my transa@@ c@@ tional &quot; experience &quot; on a scale of one to five star@@ s .
in the co@@ ff@@ ee sh@@ op at the cor@@ ner of my stre@@ et it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % ti@@ p - this for bu@@ ying something over the counter .
the effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but to put pressure on the ser@@ ver to in@@ ject person@@ ality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the depart@@ ment stor@@ e stood gr@@ inning apol@@ o@@ ge@@ tically while , we@@ arily , I gave the experience of han@@ ding her my credit card five star@@ s .
S@@ he@@ f@@ ki Ku@@ q@@ i sa@@ cked by In@@ ter - &quot; No trust among direc@@ tors &quot;
today , F@@ C In@@ ter released head co@@ ach S@@ he@@ f@@ ki Ku@@ q@@ i .
Ku@@ q@@ i will be replaced by his former assis@@ tant F@@ ab@@ ri@@ z@@ io P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta .
other members of the co@@ ac@@ hing staff will continue in their current positions .
Italian P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta has previously worked as an assis@@ tant co@@ ach , for example , in S@@ under@@ land in the UK .
P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta , 51 , who joined In@@ ter &apos;s co@@ ac@@ hing staff in January , completed the U@@ E@@ F@@ A P@@ ro lic@@ ence last year .
Ste@@ f@@ an H@@ å@@ k@@ an@@ s , chairman of the Bo@@ ard of Direc@@ tors of F@@ C In@@ ter , feels sorry about the situation .
&quot; changing the head co@@ ach is never easy .
however , S@@ he@@ f@@ ki Ku@@ q@@ i d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t enjoy the trust of the clu@@ b &apos;s direc@@ tors , and there was no other choice , &quot; H@@ å@@ k@@ an@@ s commen@@ ted in the clu@@ b &apos;s press release .
P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta &apos;s agreement exten@@ ds until the end of the se@@ as@@ on .
he will take charge , together with the other co@@ ac@@ hing staff , at tomorrow &apos;s home game against H@@ I@@ F@@ K .
according to sources of I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ San@@ om@@ at , tensions have been high within the team throughout Thursday .
on Thursday morning , Ku@@ q@@ i told the players that his assis@@ tants P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta and J@@ oh@@ n A@@ ll@@ en have been moved aside .
Ku@@ q@@ i and P@@ ic@@ care@@ ta had an alter@@ c@@ ation when In@@ ter faced P@@ S K@@ em@@ i last Sa@@ tur@@ day .
L@@ ind@@ a La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us published a p@@ ho@@ to from the 198@@ 0s - C@@ an you recognise the serious viol@@ in stud@@ ent ?

La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us is also ama@@ z@@ ed by the young woman looking seriously at the ca@@ mer@@ a .
&quot; a long time ago , being serious , &quot; she says in her post .
if you cannot see the p@@ ho@@ to , cl@@ ick here .
La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us has previously pos@@ ted p@@ ho@@ tos from her past and also talked about difficult subjects .
a little more than a year ago , she pos@@ ted two p@@ ho@@ tos of her@@ self on In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m .
one of the p@@ ho@@ tos shows her 20 years ago , in the other she poses now , as a mother of two .
in the text , La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us thinks about how she has grown as a person and makes a reference to e@@ ating dis@@ orders she suffered from when she was youn@@ ger .
&quot; exactly 20 years ago and today ...
I still look the same as that 2@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l , but the difference is that I &apos;@@ ve learned to like myself and the way I look , &quot; La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us wrote .
this text was followed by has@@ h@@ ta@@ gs life , e@@ ating dis@@ order , insec@@ ure , sel@@ f@@ -@@ confidence , sel@@ f@@ -@@ este@@ e@@ m , love yourself , 1996 , 20@@ 16 , aging , g@@ ir@@ l , woman , getting older is co@@ ol .
La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us has talked openly about her earlier e@@ ating dis@@ orders .
at the age of 14 , she has hospi@@ talis@@ ed for an@@ ore@@ x@@ ia and or@@ th@@ ore@@ x@@ ia .
a little later , she suffered from bul@@ im@@ ia which was only revealed in 2006 .
she slowly started to feel better .
in addition to ther@@ ap@@ y and pe@@ er support , La@@ mp@@ en@@ i@@ us was helped by her new love .
O@@ sc@@ ar P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us taken from j@@ ai@@ l to hospi@@ tal with ch@@ est pain@@ s
this is the second time P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us has left j@@ ai@@ l for a hospi@@ tal visit .
last year he was taken to the hospi@@ tal for treatment to cuts on his w@@ ris@@ ts , which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell .
P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by prosecu@@ tors against an initial man@@ slaughter ver@@ dic@@ t .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ ka@@ mp in the early hours of Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s D@@ ay 20@@ 13 by sho@@ ot@@ ing her multi@@ ple times through a to@@ il@@ et cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le door at his P@@ re@@ tor@@ ia home .
P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us claimed he mis@@ took his g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend for a ni@@ ght@@ time in@@ tru@@ der hid@@ ing in the cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le .
prosecu@@ tors have announced their intention to appeal again , this time against P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us &apos; six@@ -@@ year sentence , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National prosecu@@ ting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa &apos;s Su@@ pre@@ me Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .
P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecu@@ tors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

red meat , da@@ iry , and chocolate could help reli@@ eve I@@ B@@ D
red meat and chocolate may sound like a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are for your di@@ ges@@ tive system .
but a new study claims quite the opposite : a di@@ et rich in me@@ at@@ -@@ based protein and da@@ iry treat@@ s could help reli@@ eve sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s of suffer@@ ers of inf@@ la@@ mma@@ tory b@@ ow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ ura@@ ble condition , which affects around 1.@@ 3 million in the US and 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 in the UK , causes s@@ tom@@ ach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , rec@@ urr@@ ing or blo@@ ody di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually ad@@ vised to do@@ d@@ ge meat and da@@ iry to so@@ o@@ the their sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s , researchers at Washington Uni@@ versity found protein &apos;s essential a@@ min@@ o ac@@ id tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han helps develop im@@ mun@@ e cells that foster a toler@@ ant g@@ ut .
lead inves@@ ti@@ ga@@ tor D@@ r Mar@@ co Col@@ onn@@ a explained im@@ mun@@ e cells pat@@ ro@@ l the g@@ ut to ensure that harmful mic@@ ro@@ bes hid@@ den in the food don &apos;@@ t s@@ ne@@ ak into the body .
cells that are capable of tri@@ gg@@ ering inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance , protecting the body without damaging sensitive t@@ issues .
when the balance til@@ ts too far to@@ ward inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation , inf@@ la@@ mma@@ tory b@@ ow@@ el disease can result .
in experi@@ ments it was found a kind of toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting im@@ mun@@ e cell appears in m@@ ice that carry a specific bac@@ teri@@ um in their gu@@ ts .
and the bac@@ teri@@ um needs tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han - one of the building bloc@@ ks of prote@@ ins - to tri@@ gg@@ er the cells &apos; appearance .
Pro@@ f@@ essor Col@@ onn@@ a said : &apos; we established a link between one bac@@ teri@@ al species - L@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ u@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the g@@ ut mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han the m@@ ice had in their di@@ et , the more of these im@@ mun@@ e cells they had . &apos;
he suggested if the same works in human@@ s , a combination of l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han@@ -@@ rich di@@ et may foster a more toler@@ ant , less inf@@ la@@ mma@@ tory g@@ ut environment .
Pos@@ t@@ doc@@ tor@@ al res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er D@@ r Lu@@ is@@ a C@@ er@@ van@@ tes@@ -@@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan@@ was stud@@ ying a kind of im@@ mun@@ e cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study m@@ ice had such cells but another group of the same stra@@ in but hou@@ sed separ@@ ately did not .
she sus@@ pected the difference had to do with the m@@ ice &apos;s g@@ ut mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ om@@ es - the community of bac@@ teri@@ a , vir@@ uses and fun@@ g@@ i that normally live within the g@@ as@@ tro@@ inte@@ s@@ tin@@ al trac@@ t .
the gu@@ ts of the m@@ ice were D@@ N@@ A sequ@@ enc@@ ed and it was found six bac@@ teri@@ al species present in the m@@ ice with the im@@ mun@@ e cells but ab@@ sent from the m@@ ice without them .
m@@ ice re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so they la@@ cked a g@@ ut mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome and do not develop this kind of im@@ mun@@ e cell were given l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i and the im@@ mun@@ e cells ar@@ ose .
to understand how the bac@@ teri@@ a affected the im@@ mun@@ e system , the researchers gre@@ w l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in li@@ qu@@ id and then transferred small amounts of the li@@ qu@@ id - without bac@@ teri@@ a - to im@@ mature im@@ mun@@ e cells isolated from m@@ ice .
the im@@ mun@@ e cells developed into the toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting cells .
when the active component was pu@@ ri@@ fied from the li@@ qu@@ id , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han me@@ tab@@ ol@@ ism known as ind@@ ol@@ e@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id .
when the researchers doub@@ led the amount of tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han in the m@@ ice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells ro@@ se by about 50 per@@ cent but when tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dro@@ pped by half .
D@@ r C@@ er@@ van@@ tes@@ -@@ Bar@@ ra@@ g@@ an explained people have the same toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting cells as m@@ ice , and most of us sh@@ el@@ ter l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ as@@ tro@@ inte@@ s@@ tin@@ al trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han by@@ products from l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i ind@@ u@@ ce the cells to develop in people as they do in m@@ ice , but def@@ ec@@ ts in gen@@ es related to tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inf@@ la@@ mma@@ tory b@@ ow@@ el disease .
she said : &apos; the development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation on the inner sur@@ face of the inte@@ s@@ tin@@ es .
potentially , high levels of tr@@ y@@ p@@ top@@ han in the presence of l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i may ind@@ u@@ ce expansion of this population . &apos;

White House pro@@ p cost taxpayers Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Mar@@ ine hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to the South la@@ wn for an event highlighting American manufac@@ turing last month cost taxpayers as much as $ 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 , according to military recor@@ ds released to time .
the gre@@ en@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D , known as Mar@@ ine O@@ ne when the President is ab@@ o@@ ard , was the cen@@ ter@@ piece of the July 17 event at the White House sh@@ ow@@ cas@@ ing American construction progra@@ ms .
President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp , Vice President M@@ ike p@@ ence and senior White House officials tou@@ red manufac@@ turing products from all 50 states .
the C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut@@ -@@ made hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter was dis@@ played alongside a y@@ ac@@ h@@ t from Ma@@ ine , a fire truc@@ k from W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in , and a for@@ k@@ lift from M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
the White House M@@ ili@@ tary Office requested the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter &apos;s presence in a frag@@ mentary order , or F@@ R@@ A@@ G@@ O , bar@@ ely 36 hours before the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter lan@@ ded on the South la@@ wn for the &quot; un@@ usual &quot; event , according to the recor@@ ds of Mar@@ ine hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter squ@@ ad@@ ron O@@ ne ( H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it &apos;s such an un@@ usual high visi@@ bility event , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der of H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 e@@ ma@@ iled his su@@ peri@@ or , the Mar@@ ine De@@ pu@@ ty Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant for A@@ vi@@ ation , the day before the event .
the message indicated the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter would arrive on the South la@@ wn at approximately 7 a.@@ m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event , and remain until the la@@ wn was cle@@ ared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening .
the note ad@@ ds that should the departure from the White House be delayed , a second air@@ crew would be needed for the return flight due to du@@ ty@@ -@@ hour restrictions .
the original flight crew was with the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter during the event , while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground .
it was not clear from recor@@ ds provided to time whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the hat@@ ch Act prohib@@ its federal employees from using government property for political purposes .
recor@@ ds indicate that H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 in@@ qui@@ red about whether the event might viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; one question we asked was if it was a violation of the hat@@ ch Act and were informed it was not , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der wrote .
&quot; s@@ ounds like you are loc@@ ked , &quot; the De@@ pu@@ ty Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant replied .
the &quot; made in America &quot; event was desig@@ na@@ ted an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the hat@@ ch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ ton@@ es .
at the event , the President made a push for heal@@ th@@ care reform efforts then underway in the Sen@@ ate and tou@@ ted efforts to re@@ in in government regulations .
using the aircraft known as Mar@@ ine O@@ ne or A@@ ir For@@ ce O@@ ne for politically advanta@@ geous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
but requ@@ is@@ ition@@ ing their use solely for a p@@ ho@@ to@@ -@@ op is un@@ usual .
tru@@ mp drew scrutiny in February when the presidential air@@ plan@@ e ta@@ xi@@ ed to the back@@ drop of his first campaign ra@@ lly in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , F@@ la . , and his T@@ wit@@ ter account is fl@@ us@@ h with messages compla@@ ining about his pre@@ dec@@ essor &apos;s use of the presidential aircraft .
&quot; the White House is th@@ ri@@ lled with the &apos; made In America &apos; sh@@ ow@@ case that fea@@ tured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said White House de@@ pu@@ ty press secre@@ tary L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South la@@ wn to practice de@@ pos@@ iting the President of the United States at the White House with in@@ ches of prec@@ ision .
when tru@@ mp was at the G@@ -@@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 conducted 58 practice lan@@ dings at the White House .
the flight for the made in America event coun@@ ted to@@ ward the air@@ crew &apos;s training requirement for the month , an official said .
unit hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters also fle@@ w an additional 11 hours that day for &quot; non@@ -@@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps fea@@ tured at the event .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in arran@@ ging for the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to be dis@@ played on the South la@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t maintain budgetary recor@@ ds for presidential flights , and determining the precise cost inc@@ ur@@ red by the event is difficult .
but according to De@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se h@@ our@@ ly rates for fiscal year 20@@ 17 , the Do@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D is $ 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 80 per flight hour .
unit recor@@ ds record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Mar@@ ine Cor@@ ps A@@ ir F@@ ac@@ ility Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
the White House argu@@ es the true cost of operating the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter is well below that rate .
&quot; to place a cost to taxpayers based on the re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rate estimates is highly misleading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said .
&quot; these rate estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other sun@@ k costs that are included in annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a 20@@ 15 r@@ and study , Do@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rates do not include the cost of personnel , but do account for fuel , maintenance , and contrac@@ ting costs .
at the time , former White House press secre@@ tary S@@ ean S@@ pic@@ er defended the use of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to sh@@ ow@@ case this week things that are made in America , &quot; S@@ pic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , I assume , hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that .
and I think , like most Americans , we &apos;@@ re all proud of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked ti@@ re@@ lessly to do .
so , of course , it &apos;s appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was@@ n &apos;@@ t clear whether tru@@ mp interac@@ ted with the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter as he tou@@ red the South la@@ wn for the event , but he did step into the dri@@ ver &apos;s seat of a fire truc@@ k .
inside the White House , tru@@ mp addressed S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representatives , jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

Prosecutor General of Venezu@@ ela demands justice when ap@@ pointing new dele@@ gates
the Prosecutor General of Venezu@@ ela has applied for a court order to prevent the new dele@@ gates from being appointed .
Nic@@ ol@@ as Mad@@ uro , President of Venezu@@ ela , has announced that the new dele@@ gates elected through last S@@ un@@ day &apos;s elections will be appointed on Friday .
as a result of the controversial elections , Venezu@@ ela received new dele@@ gates who are authorised , for example , to amend the nation &apos;s constitution .
according to Prosecutor General Lu@@ is@@ a Ortega , the decision to prevent the appointment was demanded due to suspic@@ ions that the elections were rig@@ ged .
Ortega has also launched investigations for the alleg@@ edly rig@@ ged elections .
she appointed two judges after the British company that organised the elections announced that the results had been manipu@@ lated .
according to the company , the number of voters reported by Venezu@@ el@@ an officials is higher than the number of actual voters by approximately one million .
only Mad@@ uro &apos;s allies ran for the constitu@@ ent assembly , and the 5@@ 45 dele@@ gates elected include , for example , Mad@@ uro &apos;s wi@@ fe and son .
in addition to amending the constitution , the dele@@ gates are authorised to dis@@ solve the oppos@@ ition@@ -@@ led con@@ g@@ ress and amend laws .
Mad@@ uro described as a dicta@@ tor
Mad@@ uro &apos;s actions have been criticised exten@@ sively .
the opposition regards the attempts to amend the constitution as a way for Mad@@ uro to strengthen his position .
the United States has imposed sanctions on Mad@@ uro and called him a dicta@@ tor .
the EU , the UK , Mexico , C@@ olu@@ mb@@ ia and Argent@@ ina have announced that they will not recognise the new dele@@ gates .
Mad@@ uro claims that the new dele@@ gates offer a solution for the country &apos;s political and financial crisis .
un@@ rest in Venezu@@ ela has already gone on for months .
many have been inju@@ red and more than 100 people have been killed .
Venezu@@ ela faced a financial crisis after the price of oil collap@@ sed .
now , many cannot afford food or medicine .
the opposition is expected to organise a protest on Friday when the new dele@@ gates are to start in the constitu@@ ent assembly .
Russian man extra@@ di@@ ted from Finland was senten@@ ced to four years of imprison@@ ment in the USA
on Thursday , the Dis@@ tric@@ t Court of Min@@ ne@@ apol@@ is in the United States senten@@ ced 4@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old ma@@ xi@@ m Sen@@ ak@@ h to nearly four years of imprison@@ ment for his involvement in a global computer fraud .
Sen@@ ak@@ h was ap@@ prehen@@ ded in Finland in August 20@@ 15 as a result of a claim issued by the USA .
according to Russian newspaper F@@ on@@ tan@@ ka , Sen@@ ak@@ h was on holid@@ ay in Finland .
the Finnish border authorities ap@@ prehen@@ ded him when he was returning home .
AF@@ P reports that Finland extra@@ di@@ ted Sen@@ ak@@ h to the US criminal justice authorities in February 20@@ 16 , regardless of the objections of the Rus@@ si@@ ans .
in March , he was found guilty of a computer fraud to generate millions of doll@@ ars in profits .
Sen@@ ak@@ h was senten@@ ced to 46 months of imprison@@ ment .
according to the US De@@ part@@ ment of Justice , Sen@@ ak@@ h will be expe@@ lled once he has served his sentence .
the Russian Minis@@ try of Foreign Affairs bla@@ med Finland har@@ sh@@ ly after the ap@@ prehen@@ sion and stated that Sen@@ ak@@ h must not be extra@@ di@@ ted to the United States .
in its statement , it criticised Finland and the USA for ap@@ prehen@@ ding the man in Finland without noti@@ fying Russia of the situation be@@ fore@@ hand .
according to the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office , Sen@@ ak@@ h had used a computer virus called E@@ bur@@ y to infec@@ t tens of thousands of compu@@ ters around the world .
the virus was then used to ph@@ ish us@@ er@@ names and pass@@ words .
next , the perpet@@ ra@@ tors used these to r@@ er@@ ou@@ te inter@@ net traffic to commit cl@@ ick fra@@ u@@ ds and spread jun@@ k mail .
according to K@@ enn@@ et@@ h B@@ lan@@ co , acting direc@@ tor of the Financial C@@ r@@ imes En@@ for@@ cement N@@ et@@ work , this case indicates that the USA is also able to ch@@ ase cy@@ ber@@ criminals operating in other countries .
&quot; we have the ability and will to identify and track them , and to bring them to justice , &quot; B@@ lan@@ co stated in his statement .

Kar@@ i K@@ ola ( in the p@@ ho@@ to ) , a light artis@@ t from J@@ o@@ ensu@@ u , will ins@@ tal@@ l a spec@@ tac@@ ular light dis@@ play in Paris on 1 May of next year to celeb@@ rate the first UN D@@ ay of Li@@ ght .
K@@ ola &apos;s install@@ ation entitled &quot; D@@ ay and Ni@@ ght &quot;
deals with light and d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness - day and night - the su@@ n and the mo@@ on .
the install@@ ation li@@ ghts up UN@@ ES@@ C@@ O &apos;s head@@ quarters at place de F@@ on@@ te@@ no@@ y and the G@@ lo@@ be mon@@ u@@ ment in front of the building .
&quot; with this install@@ ation , I want to emphasise not only light , but also d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness .
currently , light pollution from met@@ ro@@ pol@@ ises is a major problem that affects us all .
through my art , I can conc@@ re@@ tely dis@@ play them@@ es that I find important , &quot; light artis@@ t Kar@@ i K@@ ola says descri@@ bing his install@@ ation .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m touched by this invitation to take part in the very first D@@ ay of Li@@ ght and bring light art as part of the day , &quot; K@@ ola says .
Kar@@ i K@@ ola took part in the opening cer@@ em@@ ony of the Year of Li@@ ght in 20@@ 15 when he ill@@ u@@ min@@ ated UN@@ ES@@ C@@ O &apos;s head@@ quarters .
&quot; I feel privileged by having the opportunity to light up the ic@@ onic building , &quot; Kar@@ i K@@ ola says .
the install@@ ation may expand significantly .

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women , U@@ .@@ N@@ . says
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , the head of the U@@ .@@ N@@ . mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday .
Nichol@@ as Ha@@ ys@@ om , acting head of the U@@ .@@ N@@ . As@@ sis@@ tance M@@ is@@ sion said hundreds of women are running in prov@@ in@@ cial council elections , three women are running for vice president and more than 30 per@@ cent of the new@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ registered voters are women .

flo@@ od of certain types of touris@@ ts threa@@ tens local culture
the authorities are considering limiting the number of touris@@ ts in V@@ en@@ ice .
the local population is particularly en@@ ra@@ ged by touris@@ ts travelling on cru@@ ise ships .
the Italian Minister of C@@ ul@@ tural Her@@ ita@@ ge and Ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and Tourism calls this &quot; e@@ at and fle@@ e &quot; tourism : travell@@ ers spend a few hours at a destin@@ ation , running through the major attrac@@ tions as a large group .
V@@ en@@ ice is su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating under travell@@ ers p@@ opp@@ ing in the city for a day .
it is difficult to move around in narrow stre@@ ets and beauti@@ ful s@@ quar@@ es are pac@@ ked with touris@@ ts , leaving no room for those who live in V@@ en@@ ice .
they are forced to move far@@ ther away from the historic centre , while homes have been replaced by ho@@ tel@@ s .
the problems presented by tourism in V@@ en@@ ice are reported by The New York T@@ imes and The Gu@@ ar@@ dian .
the authorities are considering limiting the number of touris@@ ts .
they call the current phenomenon low@@ -@@ quality tourism .
&quot; when a large oc@@ ean lin@@ er arri@@ ves at port , you have two to three hours to see the city .
you follow a fla@@ g@@ -@@ holding guide from Pi@@ a@@ zz@@ ale R@@ oma to the Ri@@ al@@ to Br@@ id@@ ge and Pi@@ a@@ zz@@ a San Mar@@ co and then turn back , &quot; says D@@ ar@@ io Fran@@ c@@ es@@ ch@@ ini , the Minister of C@@ ul@@ tural Her@@ ita@@ ge and Ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and Tourism , descri@@ bing the current problematic form of tourism .
&quot; the be@@ au@@ ty of Italian cities does not lie only in archite@@ cture , but also in their location , sto@@ res and wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s .
we need to be able to preserve this part of the identity of our cities . &quot;
Pi@@ a@@ zz@@ a San Mar@@ co is one of the most popular attrac@@ tions in the historic centre of V@@ en@@ ice .
S@@ ain@@ t Mar@@ k &apos;s B@@ asi@@ lic@@ a is located by the pi@@ a@@ zz@@ a .
the local population is mainly ang@@ ered by cru@@ ise ships .
the historic centre of V@@ en@@ ice only has a local population of 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 .
in 19@@ 51 , its population was 17@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 .
in July , rou@@ gh@@ ly 2@@ ,@@ 000 V@@ ene@@ ti@@ ans protes@@ ted against mass tourism .
according to them , tourism reduc@@ es their quality of life , des@@ tro@@ ys the environment and dri@@ ves out the local population .
&quot; some 2@@ ,@@ 000 people move out every year .
if the same continues , there will be nothing but touris@@ ts in V@@ en@@ ice .
this would be a social , an@@ thro@@ pol@@ og@@ ical and historical disaster , &quot; says Car@@ lo Bel@@ frame , one of the organis@@ ers of the demonstration .
this is a difficult situation , as cru@@ ise ships provide V@@ en@@ ice with b@@ ad@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ needed funds and jobs in various fields .
in addition to limiting the number of touris@@ ts , one solution would be if cru@@ ise ships mo@@ o@@ red far@@ ther away from the historic centre .
according to Lu@@ ci@@ an@@ o B@@ or@@ to@@ t who lives in V@@ en@@ ice , the situation would certainly change if the V@@ ene@@ to , the administrative region where V@@ en@@ ice is located , had more power to decide on its own affairs , or became fully autonomous even .
every year , V@@ en@@ ice is visited by 20 to 30 million touris@@ ts .

I get along fine without such attention
the 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old run@@ ner has witnessed the down@@ sides of being in the public eye .
Am@@ ali@@ e I@@ u@@ el has published spec@@ tac@@ ular p@@ ho@@ tos of her@@ self in such places as the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ y@@ on .
Dan@@ is@@ h@@ -@@ Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an Am@@ ali@@ e I@@ u@@ el has become a highly popular a@@ th@@ l@@ ete in her current home country Nor@@ way , not least because she bro@@ ke the 2@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an record in 400 met@@ res by cros@@ sing the line at 5@@ 1.@@ 81 .
a month later she bro@@ ke the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an record in 400 met@@ res hur@@ d@@ les by running 5@@ 5.@@ 38 .
a frequent user of social media , I@@ u@@ el noticed , soon after breaking the recor@@ ds , that there are down@@ sides to being famous and in the public eye .
men from all parts of the world started to send her p@@ ho@@ tos of their gen@@ i@@ tals in the hope of cat@@ ching the attention of the young hur@@ d@@ ler .
I@@ u@@ el was forced to make her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account private .
&quot; I received numerous ob@@ sc@@ ene p@@ ho@@ tos from people I don &apos;@@ t know , and I had to make my account private , &quot; I@@ u@@ el said to V@@ G .
in her inter@@ view for V@@ G , I@@ u@@ el did not want to go into details regarding the p@@ ho@@ tos she has received .
&quot; you can probably gu@@ ess , &quot; I@@ u@@ el said lau@@ gh@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s n@@ ice to get feed@@ back after my run , but I can get along nic@@ ely without the other kind of attention . &quot;
I@@ u@@ el was born in Denmark in 1994 .
her mother is Danish and his fa@@ ther is Dan@@ is@@ h@@ -@@ Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an .
I@@ u@@ el &apos;s family moved to Nor@@ way when she was two years old .
when Am@@ ali@@ e was 12 , the family first moved to Na@@ mi@@ bia and then to Pakistan because of her fa@@ ther &apos;s work .
these were followed by D@@ ub@@ a@@ i , T@@ ha@@ il@@ and and the United States .
I@@ u@@ el trained four years at the Uni@@ versity of Sou@@ thern C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es , from where she returned to Nor@@ way .
in June 20@@ 15 , she changed from being Danish to being Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an .

foot in@@ jur@@ y threatened the whole career of s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der J@@ an@@ ne Kor@@ p@@ i - now ready to race in the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships : &quot; it &apos;s n@@ ice when nothing hur@@ ts &quot;
it &apos;s been fu@@ n to s@@ no@@ w@@ board when nothing hur@@ ts !
J@@ an@@ ne Kor@@ p@@ i , 31 , one of the most successful s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ders in Finland , has once again been able to enjoy the sport he lov@@ es .
last summer , his whole career was at risk .
a re@@ pet@@ itive stra@@ in in@@ jur@@ y to Kor@@ p@@ i &apos;s foot required sur@@ ger@@ y in January , and the foot took its time heal@@ ing .
Kor@@ p@@ i &apos;s has also hur@@ t his arm when rac@@ ing .
&quot; in summer , I had no idea whether or not I would be able to continue my career .
my spon@@ sor@@ ship deals ended and many things remained un@@ decided , &quot; Kor@@ p@@ i says .
&quot; but so they say that everything will be al@@ right in the end .
my foot got better , my spon@@ s@@ or extended our deal by two years and I wanted to get back on the s@@ lop@@ es .
after all this , it was an easy decision to continue my career .
I knew it when I hit the s@@ lop@@ es again .
I thought that , da@@ mn , this sure is fu@@ n , let &apos;s continue for a couple of se@@ as@@ ons . &quot;
Kor@@ p@@ i was able to r@@ ide properly in September and October , but being able to train without any pain after a long break was a big thing .
Kor@@ p@@ i has only rac@@ ed a few times ,
but that is O@@ K .
ra@@ ces have never been that important in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding for Kor@@ p@@ i .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve never s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded for the sake of any single competition .
it &apos;s frustra@@ ting to train four years for a single competition , only to fall ill just before .
I don &apos;@@ t have that min@@ d@@ set , &quot; Kor@@ p@@ i says .
today , Kor@@ p@@ i will be rac@@ ing in the hal@@ f@@ pi@@ pe event of the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in Sierra Ne@@ va@@ da , Spain .
even though individual compet@@ itions are not what attrac@@ t Kor@@ p@@ i in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding , he is always fi@@ red up and ready to race .
according to Kor@@ p@@ i , compet@@ itions held by the International s@@ ki Federation ( f@@ is ) have become more widely accepted in recent years , even though some s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ders ch@@ ose to take part in the X@@ -@@ G@@ ames that are held at the same time in Nor@@ way .
&quot; these are big ra@@ ces with a lot of expos@@ ure round the world .
then again , I think that acceptance always depends on the conditions and level of each competition . &quot;
Kor@@ p@@ i is the ol@@ dest a@@ th@@ l@@ ete in the 12@@ -@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ ete T@@ e@@ am Finland compet@@ ing in Sierra Ne@@ va@@ da .
the youn@@ g@@ est members of the team , 17@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old R@@ ene R@@ in@@ ne@@ k@@ an@@ gas and E@@ mm@@ i Par@@ k@@ k@@ is@@ en@@ ni@@ em@@ i , are 14 years youn@@ ger than Kor@@ p@@ i .
&quot; it &apos;s fu@@ n to watch the youn@@ ger rid@@ ers .
I remember when I was that young that everything was new and I was ins@@ an@@ ely ex@@ ci@@ ted about everything .
this also gives me energy , &quot; Kor@@ p@@ i says .
&quot; I can just about keep up with them on the s@@ lop@@ es , but no@@ where else ; they are so full of energy ! &quot;
alongside his s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding career , J@@ an@@ ne Kor@@ p@@ i has also been building another career in sports .
the son of leg@@ end@@ ary har@@ ness rac@@ er P@@ e@@ k@@ ka Kor@@ p@@ i is a f@@ an of har@@ ness rac@@ ing : he has his own rac@@ eh@@ or@@ ses that he prepar@@ es training plans for .
&quot; when I &apos;@@ m travelling all the time , there &apos;s no time to be more involved .
however , I try to at least check the race results every day , even watch some ra@@ ces as well , &quot; Kor@@ p@@ i says .
according to Kor@@ p@@ i , har@@ ness rac@@ ing and co@@ ac@@ hing offer a potential career plan when his s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding career eventually ends .
&quot; I don &apos;@@ t want to look that far ahead , but it &apos;s a possible option .
it feels like I &apos;@@ m stud@@ ying it alongside s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding .
I try to stay on top of things and improve myself , maybe even take part in a few ra@@ ces in summer .
if that becomes my future profession , it won &apos;@@ t be that hard to start if I already know a thing or two . &quot;
the El@@ it@@ lop@@ p@@ et cru@@ ise hos@@ ted together with J@@ a@@ aj@@ o L@@ inn@@ on@@ ma@@ a is also part of har@@ ness rac@@ ing .
the two have le@@ ased a cru@@ ise ship for the El@@ it@@ lop@@ p@@ et event in Stockholm at the end of May .
Kor@@ p@@ i and L@@ inn@@ on@@ ma@@ a decided to bring the ag@@ e@@ -@@ old tradition back to life .
&quot; we &apos;@@ ve already sold he@@ aps of cru@@ ise tic@@ k@@ ets , and there &apos;s been pl@@ enty of ex@@ ci@@ tement about the event .
now we are at the point where at least we cannot go bank@@ rupt .
there are still a few months to go , and we hope that we have a ship full of people , &quot; Kor@@ p@@ i says enthusias@@ tically .
A@@ t@@ ten@@ do &apos;s nur@@ sing home project in K@@ ite@@ e has taken everyone by surprise
A@@ t@@ ten@@ do Es@@ ter@@ i is the name of the new nur@@ sing home to be built in K@@ ite@@ e . it will have room for 41 elderly cli@@ ents .
the over 1@@ ,@@ 700 m@@ 2 building will be completed next summer across the heal@@ th@@ care centre on Ter@@ ve@@ ys@@ tie .
people in K@@ ite@@ e are won@@ dering from where the new nur@@ sing home intends to get its cli@@ ents , as the social and heal@@ th@@ care service reform has caused a shortage of cli@@ ents at many private nur@@ sing homes .
A@@ nne F@@ link , regional direc@@ tor of nur@@ sing services at A@@ t@@ ten@@ do , said that K@@ ite@@ e will have demand not only for op@@ tional services , but also for service hous@@ ing with 2@@ 4@@ -@@ hour assistance .
&quot; all kinds of services are needed and , when there are options , people also have the freedom of choice , &quot; F@@ link says .
last year , A@@ t@@ ten@@ do acquired private nur@@ sing homes K@@ an@@ er@@ v@@ ik@@ k@@ ol@@ a and E@@ er@@ ika in K@@ ite@@ e .
the transa@@ ction covered the business operations of these homes , but A@@ t@@ ten@@ do apparently has a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year le@@ ase agreement on the buildings .
F@@ link says that A@@ t@@ ten@@ do has no urgent need to move its operations from these buildings .
more news will be released later today .
G@@ M@@ B concern over investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w fac@@ tory
a union is seeking reas@@ su@@ rance from manag@@ ers at b@@ is@@ cu@@ it ma@@ k@@ er Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s over its long@@ -@@ term commitment to production at its fac@@ tory in G@@ las@@ go@@ w .
G@@ M@@ B Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 people work at the plant , which produc@@ es H@@ ob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich te@@ a b@@ is@@ cu@@ its , among other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s ow@@ ner P@@ la@@ d@@ is said it had invested more than £ 5@@ m at the site in the last few years .
it added employees and union representatives &quot; will be the first to know &quot; if there were any changes to its operations .
in a letter to the company &apos;s site manag@@ er , G@@ M@@ B Scotland called on Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s to &quot; address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er drew Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manag@@ er over the business needs and investment plan for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerning our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater G@@ las@@ go@@ w area , a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priva@@ tion .
so , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the back@@ drop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and ch@@ ron@@ ic manufac@@ turing decline , the east end of G@@ las@@ go@@ w desper@@ ately needs a th@@ ri@@ ving manufac@@ turing presence at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s . &quot;
a spo@@ kes@@ woman for P@@ la@@ d@@ is said : &quot; the site manag@@ er at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing eng@@ agement with employees and union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ M@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly .
we discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested over £ 5@@ m in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , notably on production lines and operational improvements .
we fully recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufac@@ turing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . &quot;
did P@@ S@@ G warn Barcelona about move for Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
la L@@ ig@@ a side may ru@@ e their interest in Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti
Paris S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main will not let up in their pursuit of Ne@@ y@@ mar after lo@@ d@@ ging a £ 18@@ 9@@ m offer to tri@@ gg@@ er his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona of the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ record ra@@ id three years ago ?
the sen@@ sa@@ tional approach has li@@ t up the summer transfer win@@ dow , with the Li@@ gue 1 clu@@ b ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark , which saw P@@ aul P@@ og@@ ba return to Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United last se@@ as@@ on for £ 8@@ 9@@ m .
once completed , the move will see Ne@@ y@@ mar become the world &apos;s most expensive pla@@ yer and also the hi@@ gh@@ es@@ t@@ -@@ paid professional s@@ port@@ s@@ man in the world , with P@@ S@@ G offering wages of over £ 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ week after tax .
Barcelona are known to be fu@@ rious with the manner of the approach and the way that Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , despite a source close to the Catal@@ ans &apos; board insis@@ ting that the clu@@ b have always done their best to look after him since his arri@@ val from San@@ tos in 20@@ 13 .
but was the football world war@@ ned of this prospect three years ago by the P@@ S@@ G president ?
when Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter C@@ ity expressed an interest in signing Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ id@@ i in 20@@ 14 , N@@ ass@@ er Al@@ -@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f@@ i had a ster@@ n warning for any clu@@ b looking to sign one of P@@ S@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we &apos;@@ ll contact their players , &quot; Al@@ -@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f@@ i said .
&quot; we respect all clu@@ bs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , they &apos;@@ ll face consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appear to have cros@@ sed this line , with the Spanish clu@@ b expressing an interesting in P@@ S@@ G mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti earlier this summer .
P@@ S@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their pri@@ ze assets in Ne@@ y@@ mar .

the calls with the President of Mexico and the leader of the bo@@ y S@@ cou@@ ts p@@ raised by tru@@ mp turned out to be f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ations .
Sar@@ ah H@@ uc@@ ka@@ be@@ e Sanders , the White House press secre@@ tary , confirmed that neither one of the calls took place .
however , she said that tru@@ mp did not lie .
according to Sanders , many leaders of the bo@@ y S@@ cou@@ ts talked with tru@@ mp in person , and tru@@ mp had a conver@@ sa@@ tion with En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a Ni@@ e@@ to , the President of Mexico , at the G@@ 20 summit in H@@ am@@ burg .
&quot; I W@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t say it was a lie - that &apos;s a pre@@ tty b@@ old accus@@ ation .
the conver@@ sa@@ tions took place , they just simply d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t take place over a phone call , they happened in person , &quot; Sanders said .
speech to bo@@ y S@@ cou@@ ts raised criticism
on Monday , tru@@ mp told that the President of Mexico called him and congratu@@ lated tru@@ mp for his success in reducing illegal immigration .
according to tru@@ mp , Pe@@ ñ@@ a Ni@@ e@@ to said that not many cross the southern border because they know that they will be stopped at the US bor@@ der@@ line .
on Wednesday , the Mexic@@ an Government issued a statement , saying that this phone call never took place .
on Tuesday , Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o published a full version of tru@@ mp &apos;s inter@@ view with the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal
where tru@@ mp p@@ raised his speech at the National sc@@ out j@@ am@@ bo@@ re@@ e in West V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
&quot; I got a call from the leader of bo@@ y S@@ cou@@ ts who said that it was the best speech that was ever made to them ,
and they were very than@@ k@@ ful , &quot; tru@@ mp said .
on Wednesday , the bo@@ y S@@ cou@@ ts of America announced that they do not have any information about any of their leaders placing a call to tru@@ mp .
according to the announcement , the previous statement of Mic@@ ha@@ el S@@ ur@@ b@@ au@@ gh , the Chi@@ ef sc@@ out Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive , in which he apolog@@ ised to all members of the organisation for tru@@ mp &apos;s speech speaks for itself .
tru@@ mp &apos;s speech at the National sc@@ out j@@ am@@ bo@@ re@@ e ar@@ ou@@ sed aston@@ is@@ hment , as it was un@@ usually political considering the nature of the event .
for example , he p@@ raised the results of last autumn &apos;s presidential election .
