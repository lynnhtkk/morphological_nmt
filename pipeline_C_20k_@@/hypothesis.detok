Cam Auer wanted to correct her sex, diagnosed as a mental disease and now he is doing a skill on the subject - 'people should have the right to their own body'.
Dozens of patient reports occur from the disappearance of the Academy Project-Gallery.
Each of them reads the name of Cap Auer.
Paper tells us a multi-annual story of the way in which people outside have written their interpretation of Auberia and this identity.
He has decided who he is.
'I wanted to say 'I wanted to give you a personal care history so that the violence of the process becomes visible', Mrs Auer tells us.
The process refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long-term research period with meetings with psychologists, psychologists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with the studies carried out at Tampere and Helsinki on the sexual harassment of identity.
The Auer process started four years ago.
Even before this was done, he had used his estate gene through the Internet and had a very long way to go in his own process of repair.
She felt that she was a woman, but, according to Finnish law, a person must go through the process of repair so that the gender can also be legally corrected.
The Transk Act, that is to say the law on the strengthening of the sex of the Saxony-Saxony Peninsula (563 / 2002), obliges people of the sexes to force sterilisation so that the right sex can be placed in, for example, a demographic register and a passport.
At the moment, every repair of the family is required to diagnosis the psychiatric diagnosis and to prove inability.
People are entitled to decide on their own bodies.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," Auer says.
There has been a great deal of talk of reforming the law in Finland.
The UN Council on Human Rights has made eight comments and the European ideal-law court is a precedent which forces the parties in the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their sovereignty.
The former Finnish Government prepared a legislative amendment under the then Social and Health Minister, Mr Susaka Huovi.
Elections were held and the Peruvians came to government.
Now, the legal change is once again in the pockets.
We are talking about internal political disputes which do not even exist in this law.
'The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law ', Frank Johanson, the Executive Director of the Supervisor of Finland.
Two major staffing operations are dominated by the interests of this state of affairs.
One of them is the packaging and use instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.
In the space of the Poos report, any channel can read, for example, the psychological interpretation of the traliberal hospital in Tampere from Auberia.
Mr Psykovi met Mr Auer twice and, on the basis of them, wrote a report which should define the management of Auer's law and access to aid.
The insight into the reality of the situation seems to be dangerous to destabilise.
The concept of self-examination appears to be fragmented and unstable in terms of personality.
Auer did not recognise himself from these descriptions.
'It was shocking to hear me diagnosed as a mental disease 'Auer says.
It was even more shocking when she was not given sexual correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not enough to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
At that time, on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and praised the expectations of tranchi on television.
Later on, the art of that television was born of its name, 'Movement for Exluded', where Auer refleck tried its experience of power and its use.
'It is crazy that anyone who has been born as a woman can enlarge his side, but in order to remove the circle, Auer tells us.
Mr Kehosi is not your own if the homes were anything but the sex defined in the birth.
Mrs Auer's experience is not, unfortunately, the only one in terms of quality.
The process of repair is more severe for many spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
There are dozens of people who must be justified in their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
'It is crazy that people who are in need of aid and assistance are denied treatment on the pretext that their resources are not enough ', Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have a photograph of teeth, anguish, possible harassment experiences.
On this basis, the medical staff can stipulate that treatment cannot begin.
"Prevention of treatment and assistance can eat an even worse situation than it was before the start of the process" Auer says.
Mrs Auer's personal exhibition also addresses the issue of anxiety and self-destruction.
In the text of the publication, Auer writes: 'I have had some self-destructive ideas throughout my adult age and that is what it is generally difficult for people to merge'.
It has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones it was easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenager.
Why sleep did not appear to be suitable for its own body and why breast-free meat had to be a wheel instead of an equal disciplinary framework.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
One future is a fundamental need.
'You have to justify themselves so much by talking, dressing, using votes and moving movements', he says.
Today, Auer is already trying to see his future as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, there could be a great deal of acceleration.
It is the case that close sexual abuse is most likely to occur.
"They should know and know who I am, but they are not willing or unable to internalise it," he will continue.
But not all traliberal people need physical change.
They do not suffer from organ reform, that is to say, from a conflict of bodies in which a circle or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and the lengthy research process, however, there can be no official confirmation of their own sex.
"These studies have no medical basis," Auer says.
And that is true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of the legal sex.
New legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to the legal sex.
The pensioner is making a written application for a new personal insight, stating that he feels that he is a second sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will give the applicant a new identity.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition is also a matter of dispute.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for artists; it has been a political and artistic compilation.
I would like to believe that art remains important and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
The exhibition by Cam Aueri in Project Roo of Antiphic Dick 4.28.2017.
The civil justice organisation issued a travel warning to Misskar
The NAACP has issued a travel warning against Missouria, which is the result of discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks.
The travel communication on NACP Misssar will enter into force from 28.8.2017, and calls on averroAmerican tourists, visitors and local tourists to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a federal state where there have been a number of questionable racial events recently.
The law which has just entered into force in Missour makes it more difficult for cases of discrimination to be exported to justice and for the laws of a state to be applied to minorities, which, according to the NAC, led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are being stopped on the basis of skin colour and mistreated or killed, the President of the NACP Misssar, Rod City.
"We have not heard one of many cases in just as short time."
The travel communication on Missouria is the first warning from the organisation of the United States.
The organisation mentioned, for example, the racist comments made against American students at Missour University and the death of a 28th year-old black Tony Sanders.
Mrs Sanders-ten died in dubious circumstances earlier this year, who was driving through a federal state when her car ended with fuel, arrested by the Missour police even though she was not accused of a crime.
The Missour Minister of Justice also referred to the report that the police are stopping 75% more likely than white drivers.
The aim of the communication is to urge people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues of what can happen in Missour, Chapel.
"People must prepare, for example, by including money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to go through the state".
According to FBI, in 2015, hundreds of hatred offences were recorded in Missourir, that is to say sixteen of the most American states.
This warning is also a response to the new Missour law, which makes it more difficult for businesses to be brought to justice and discriminated against in employment relations.
The ACLUU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws which force the police to arrest people from violations of immigration, which according to the organisation increases racial provocation.
Travel warnings are usually published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
General: Mr Linka asked for a report on the supplementary pension of the executive director
The Minister for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mika Linkka, has asked for a report from Mr Finnamo on the supplementary pension contributions received by the Executive Director of the airline, Peka Vaura.
According to the minister, this runs counter to the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 provided by Vaura came up this week, when the Helsinki messages announced the evolution of the rewarding of stock exchange directors.
Finland's Kuwait reported on Vaura's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair told us that he would abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has taken the line that supplementary pensions are not used to reward.
The state owns more than half of the Finnamers.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision on ownership.
Sanctions would immediately intensify the speeches.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from cold to warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the President of the United States, Donald Trum, and the President of Russia, Mr Vladimir Putin, seemed to have a good deal to do with each other.
Since then, the feeling has fallen considerably.
The new economic sanctions, which were adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Mr Trentin on Wednesday, were met in Russia.
The most recent answer has been the Prime Minister, Docri MEDA, who has so far said that the law of sanctions signed by Mr Trentin is a 'full trade war'.
Even if the Russian reaction were to be seen as political rhetoric only as aggravates and excesses, it is the fact that the US-Russia relationship is being tightened up after a short period of drought after the short election of Trentin.
In the United States, the coercion law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress adopted the law by a substantial consensus, the President was told that it was much more difficult to adopt it.
Mr Trum is critical of his recent failure to sign the law.
President Trentin's abyss may have been due, in particular, to Russia, although the adoption of a law which restricts its own rights of power has had to be odious.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States, both in terms of Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections and in terms of its contacts with Russia.
Blackmail between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of recession.
When the staff of the White House have changed their mentality and the various scandalous translations have almost been updated, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
This situation is certainly not desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a stimulus in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also the exciting security situation in the EU's core area of the Baltic Sea is stepping up relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far stood united in its Russian policy, at least on the main points, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
The economic sanctions have been a real quarrel for a member country like Finland, a country that is trading a great deal.
The effects of the recent American coercion law are still unclear.
The EU has been feared that sanctions will hinder the functioning of many European companies.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and possibly Fennover nuclear power plant project.
The leap forward in Europe has led to the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important to the American economy, for example, the LNG.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics of disdain.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing more sacrosanct?
The White House of Trentin now has the statutory statutory statutory in its star.
Interference is the safest sign of change of power.
The Americans know this just as well as others: The Iraqi people, together with American soldiers, lost Saddam Hussein's statutory in the Firdos Mary in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trentin Administration was well aware of what was going on in a heated debate with CNO, which was subjected to the attack by Mr Miller on the President's proposal to considerably reduce legal immigration.
Mr Miller did not really criticise the statutory.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by a huge number of cruise organisers and figures of the Vapaudo statutory.
His attack was aimed at the importance of the patriot and, in particular, at the fact that, in 1903, Emma Lazahn's feet was increased - 17 years after the patriot was finalised.
This was how Mr Miller stayed Acostan: 'I do not want to go into history now, but Vapaudenstame is a symbol of freedom for the whole of the world.
Ruo was added later, and it is not part of the original Vapaudo stan. "
Mr Miller was not wrong in itself, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
What is important is the words of Lazato, the only quality in which the state is not just inviting immigrants, but 'the poorest': 'Your tid, your pop, / your muss yellow bagus, / The Wwretchen of the poorest'.
Ruo is now more topical than ever.
Mr Miller made it clear that the 'poorest' are not welcome to the United States of Trentin.
The dispute about the importance of the Vapaudo statutory is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his death, friends of Lazato campaigned for the humiliation of their statutes, who knew full well that this was a highly political act.
The purpose of the patriot was to reflect the links between the French and American republics with a classical comparison, a female body of freedom.
Lazahus changed its meaning: The figure of women in his pockets is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
It gives itself a new name: The mother of the expelled.
The inclusion of Runo in the imagination was a brilliant feminist coup d 'état and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazahus changed the meaning of the patriot and the Right has long wanted to change it back to its origin.
Rush Limbugh - an oral player, which can now be seen as a sort of deputy sign of Troughter - claimed in 2010 that the Vapaudenstame statues will not be able to invite anyone, but will be a pioneer of the new conservatives, which will take the United States to hide the blind darkness of the world.
He exposes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
War does not pave the way for the United States. "
It is rare, Mrs Limbugh was partly right.
The role of the Buddhist depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazahus saw it as if poor immigrants drowned, but hopeful, after a long and hard journey.
He saw its protection and its protection from people looking for a better life.
His Vapaudo statutory is conspicuous by welcoming and welcoming.
And that is not what Miller and Trum want.
Their shock does not stand in the way, but is stirring up the flames of hatred, their only source of force.
MMPs 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish Members of the British Majesty.
Emih Doyle will remember the time when only two Scottish people got into the British Majesty.
The Executive Director Neil Black of the University Union in Britain says that 16 Scottish members of the country participating in the World Cup are 'significant confirmation'.
A record number of Scottish sportsmen and women have been elected on the MMMMMs in London on Friday.
According to Mr Blak, 'something specific is happening in Scotland', from which British public sport must learn.
"This is welcome and we will continue to explore it so long as we understand what it is," Mr Black says.
'I discussed with the representatives of the Scottish sports institute and they thought it had to do with the workings of the institution.
The Scottish Universal Association believes that it is linked to the operation of the Union;
And the British federation of Sport believes that they are behind it.
And the ordinary cadmirator believes that he must have something to do with this.
But it is something quite remarkable, and that is why it is. '
Many Scottish sportsmen and women are seriously competing in London, including Lura Muir, and Andrew Butchard, who is competing with Sir Mo Farah at 5 000 metres' race.
'Emid is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful.
"Sportsmen and women missed the opportunity to be proud of their achievements and to be highly motivated, wherever they happen to live and practise.
There was a real sense and passion with regard to sport in Mrs Eedhh 's words.
Emih Doyle is at the mercy of 400 metres of the International Community championship, and these are his fifth world championship, which he considers to be 'incredible' that 16 Scottish people have 16 Scottish.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
In the course of a year, five British and two European records have been drinked by clothes of central trips.
He is competing in London at 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare transfer to London 1 500 metres, and it is worth looking at this: The man has an excellent period of profits in MMMMM and Anniversar games in the United Kingdom.
Mrs Doyle will remember the first world championship, when the national team was the only one to join her.
The captain of the country says he is extremely proud of the fact that so many Scottish people are involved, some of which are seriously competing on the spot and on the yardstick.
It is otherwise a great honour, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain, Doyle.
'I am, of course, very proud of all the Scottish bishops who got into the national spectrum.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as sportsmen and women who compete with priests.
The captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have households.
It is important to enjoy the support of the national public and to be back in the Olympic Games.
I shall have another chance to compete there and I know that the climate will become a nonsense. "
The prevention of critics in Facebuk is a condition for public office if you cannot withstand criticism.
Our country knew what a bad publicity is.
George Washington was love by the Americans, but the newspapers started to criticise him for all possible domestic policy, always with his political principles.
This criticism was certainly irritated;
But he did not beg his critics.
'Washington said in 1783 that we could end up as stupid and silent as sheep are slaughtered '.
This brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hog, who should learn from Washington.
The Hogian staff have removed at least 450 comments and prevented their authors from doing so.
The US Civil Rights Union challenged Hog's law earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge to be unjustified, and it was also undervalued in the network.
'What difference? ', of course, it is only Facebuk, many comments.
But it is important;
In the case of Hog in particular.
Hog is the astonishing popular Governor of a democratic state.
He has received a second best assessment of his activities among 50 governors.
Hog is not sensitive to the hot.
He has led the state firmly and has strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebuo as the main source of contact with his constituents and published the picture of the 'skimmed-up' in the light of the 'cabinet.
It is therefore unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users on the website of Governor Faceek, who is a public and official forum which is maintained by his staff with taxes.
According to him, the spokesman for Hog, Amelia Chase, defends his interview with Washington's postal service, which was only about the dismissal of comments.
However, opening the flowers to tropical, stumbling or hatred is too easy a solution.
Washington Post challenged users who were prevented in the Faceb.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they elected; they were not trawlers, they were teachers, entrepreneurs and photographs.
They told us that their comments were respectable, visible and factual.
The passport quoted Ramallta in his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hog's Catholic faith.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Rami Maryland Bowe was not hostile, but asked a question about anger crimes.
'It is with courtesy that I am disappointed that Hog had not adopted a position on the crimes of hatred and other recent news', he wrote in the remarks made by Washington Post.
'It is not acceptable that, when more people make the same comments, they are immediately regarded as a sort of organised group, ignoring the concerns of a large group of people. '
The staff of the Governor called the comments' a centralised attack '; one could call them the promotion of what was considered to be important.
In the age of Facei, communication can easily be managed by preventing critics or by removing a critical comment.
Before the old person should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers which had published critical protocols, or to arrest and silence the demonstrators.
It is the same thing, however, and now it is only digital.
Hog is not the first public wrangan accused of coffee and other social media channels.
President Twiter's blocks have brought him to justice.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheri, the government of Loudou was in breach of the first addition of the American Constitution to prevent the electorate in Facebio.
And the US Civil Liberties Union visited the Kentuca republican Governor, Matt Beimin, to discuss the use of Twiters and Faico.
This should not be difficult.
The low-cost postal fees at Washington had the same effect as today's on the Internet.
The number of newspapers was four-fold from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers crashed Washington.
Even then, there were troubles.
Naker Juricola, Valerus, Beliscau and Port wrote letters in the newspapers in which they were buried at Washington's decisions.
The President's office received petitions of criticism of the JRA agreement, the cooperation, trade and maritime agreement between the United States and Britain, as shown by the documents collected by the Paperts of George Washington.
However, he did not beg his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this reality.
Let us put an end to birds' summer feed immediately.
The samples have become around 10 seats and, furthermore, the net reports on a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Eusta and Variams in Finland, but then the individual Hapatriver and Setland, the specialist scientist Marand British mumus Evirk.
Vuegeospegos have died from the hormone-monotic disease.
It is the source of its known name, Tric gaomnas gallinae, which is the original animal.
It has been known in the past that it is attacking villages, and in particular they are being pulled out of them.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected from pepotism.
The year 2009 was a very good year.
Then, Finland's beauty stock caused a great collapse, followed by the recovery of stocks of species.
The sick heroes have now been, but at least not on a large scale, the museum champion of the Helsinki University of Science Jona Honas.
It is to be feared that the last epidemic of wild acid will be renewed unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple matter which can be done by everyone: To put an end to the feeding of birds immediately.
More will be done on this subject later.
Rwanan Rafferk hopes to benefit from the domestic field in Rejan Club.
The former European King Responder, Ranan Raffereer, hopes to benefit from the domestic field over the next three days, when the Royne Club-Lothir is organised in 25: Scottish Senior Opeaker.
Last year, the Scandinavian Rafferk led the fire in Archerfield Link in a neighbouring country, but finally lost Paul Ealtonen, who welcomed the new place and acted as an ambassador on behalf of the founder and executive officer Jerry Sarrad.
'I followed the construction of the Royce Club and, as a result of this event, it will be able to get into full paralysis'.
"Players see the field at their best, and that is a wonderful condition.
Jerry has done sterling work with this place.
He is a enthusiastic envoy of the game and he is proud of his work here.
Peat is a wonderful opportunity for presentation in this field. "
For the first time, the English Eaxis defends mesticide, even though its 322th-year career has won not only the cycle of Europe but also the challenge of Europe.
"This seems to be a very special opportunity," the player in Southporte says.
'I could not defend my victory of Extremadura Opei, because peat does not belong to the quarrel this year.
It is wonderful to return.
It is a good place to play golf.
The memories of last year remind us: The victory of tourists was a joke for me and my wife, Mr Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember. "
Gary Orr is returning to real action on his own soil: He went to the ground after 50 years of filling the ground earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since 2013.
"In rural areas, playing is always more relevant", as the Orr who lives in Helenburgh says.
'We want to succeed, but we also know the extra pressure.
I have enjoyed the game again and I have played quite a very strong role.
I am pleased with the game so far. "
The trio will be followed up by the former Mastersman, Ian Wosnam and Senior Mayor Paul Broadhurti, Roger Chapman, Mark Jams and Mark McNull.
Six Scottish men are involved: Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcor, Stephen McAperter, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

In the village, potential internal air problems in the flora were identified.
In the village of Pot Brigade, there have been no internal air problems, at least for the time being, and the pronouncements were reported on Thursday.
Air investigations are continuing.
The reports began when a man who interrupted his staff for health reasons thought his health had been weakened because of a poor internal situation.
According to Ms Holman, the predecessor of Pot pronounced that there were no problems in the health situation of other Quartet.
It transpired that this was an individual case, and other services had no health problems.
Every declaration is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Mr Holma says.
The pronouncements say that, due to the July arrival, we have had to transfer goods to our flora, which has led to an increase in dust for a moment.
The air has therefore been able to appear emotional, Mr Holma states.
Poverty and death in Indonesia
Bary Degeci is not using a heat in his diet.
Even he rarely uses it.
Mr Degeci lives in the wood building in Enarotalr, in the capital of the Panzania region, which is located in the Indonesian province of Papua, where, when he is preparing for the day, he usually puts a bar - in local terms - on his lips.
A baton who has returned to the map in half an hour 's time will be eaten with the batch, the powder' s hands.
There are no furniture fish in the Degin home; he is sitting on a muddle of land, where he usually carries out his daily ash as well, such as the catch wash in a sausage that is close to the hot water.
A roll-over office is supplied with a fomster in an undismissal room.
Degeci is a young man from four wives and has not been ordered to deal with the game.
Multiple marriage is common here.
Late work may be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink, including soldiers.
'nobody dares to live in a village after five in the evening ', Degeci says.
This is a rare discipline in the west of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded a controversial referendum which forced 1 026 villages to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The Dutch Independence Movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its hatred into a government in Jakarta which keeps the region under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from coming there.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua; the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarth is remote and cholera; it begins on an hour and a half a flight from the capitals of the province, Jayayapua Nab, and will continue to be thrown up by five hours on the road to a temporary car.
There is no public transport here.
There are some 19 000 people in the town of Bamubu where there are shortcomings surrounded by the Bamubububans, where the watershed has been used as a schizophrenic.
Few foreigners have visited us here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the people of Papua Mee Paigo returned to the Gulf Tail.
Other changes have taken place.
'We did not have such clothes', Degeci tells us: He means colour, a sweetener of towing, a smell of a smell, a smell of a flowers and a cloud of church.
"We had nothing but to put our house in order."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the cornerstone of Indonesia.
Pania is the most important and most lucrative area in the world, owned by the Freport McMoran company, which has its place in the United States of Phoenix, with 153 000 inhabitants.
In 2015, the need brought a USD 3.1 billion worth of money to the Freetter.
In addition, Papua is estimated at USD 78 billion.
For the Papuans, however, these wealth is a misery, because it means the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freight paid nearly USD 20 million for local military personnel and the army's local units between 1998 and 2004, and that up to USD 150 000 was paid for individual sinks.
Mr Papua 's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and they are ignored.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has since 1969 murdered more than 500 000 Poles and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in Papua's tribal tribal highlands in the 1970s resulted in the extent of genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people in the region were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
The report by the Brannian Archbishop We will from 2016 contains reports of the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electronic attacks are particularly popular - and unrelenting attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because there are cases every week, as Andreas Harson, the Indonesian investigator of Human Rights Watch.
The pieces have been tightened up when the Papua's natural resources attract exporters elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christian, but the demographic structure is changing as the Indonesian colours, Jalle, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi, move to the region to a better income for Muslims.
The Catalan Wargunge chickens sell chickens and gadozens of vegetables in a land nuts.
It is difficult for local people to compete.
'Divers have begun to sell chickens and vegetables at a cheaper price than local ', tells us that they are 2440th year old, Abeth You, from Panzania, and changed the province's capital.
"Local women lost their clients".
Either the Indonesian President, Mr Widodo - his name Jokowi - promised in his election campaign for 2014 to address the injustices in Papua and the violations of human rights.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former bottleneck won the vote in 27 regions, including Panzania, on a visit to the President of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua and the local people feel they have been deceived.
'We got bogged down because we voted in Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfil our wishes and restore justice ', Mr You says.
In Pania, only two months after Jokow's loyal officials, there was a kind of recession.
Twelve children were staying out of Christmas with a young boat around Enarotall from 712.2014 when two Indian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle.
The fearful children told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
One of the soldiers did not like the comment: According to the local passport, Yaput Teba, he returned to four soldiers.
According to reports from the victims and witnesses, children were caught by soldiers who were abused and beaten up with these wounds.
One of the soldiers was therefore shooting children.
One of the children, the 16th-year-old Yulmons Yeimo, was harassed as a result of maltreatment.
A few hours later, the building of a government electoral commission was fled up and the next day it began.
Around a thousand Pashtuns - young men, women and children - met in football with a local police station and a command centre of the army to call for justice.
They had hunting flexibility for solemn expenses, and they started to present a Papua's traditional Wago dance, which dancing in the pipeline and trains the bird.
Some demonstrators started to stoning police and military buildings.
When I knew my heat, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: 'If the forces of human beings do more than three times, shoot them into death', the information is based on the official document that the TIEM has seen, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremis Kayame, 56, Kego Koto, the head of the population of the Kego Ko region, knew that the situation was out of control and asked the colour to calm and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen again.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left beaches" he told the TIEM of his chronic timber.
We still do not know who shoot him, but created the ranks of soldiers.
"A number of placards were shot in the air."
Alfus Youwi was shot three times: His sledgehammer crashed the shoots.
'I drink up to him and ensured that it was indeed him ', told the Yohanes TIEM in a tragic manner, and, like many of them, he uses only one name.
'I saw him killed... '.
The Papua police officer, Yotje Mende, told journalists that the police only protected the 'policeman' because it was the target of attack.
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us', Papua's police spokesman, Pudu Sulimeno, said in 2015.
"Then it is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The following day, Mr Jakarta, informed us of this.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a speech of emotion in Jayayaya, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
'I want this case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again '.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Mr Wirton, said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speech immediately.
"Most of the infringements took place long ago;
In the 90s and at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but that requires certain processes. "
In an interview with the TIEM in Jakarta at 5.6.2017, he had already changed his mind and said that he was not going to open a study in Papua.
"Everything will be clarified in the courts", as he said.
The UN accuses Wiranu of 'crimes against humanity', which involve the death of more than a thousand people in the vertical vote on independence in East Timor in 1999, and Mr Wirton said to the TIEM that eleven cases have already been investigated, including the events in Papua.
The families of the victims of Panzania are distrustful of these allegations.
'I have been challenged four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way, 'Yohanes tells me.
"I have already tired of this."
He tells us that he still lives in fear, even though it is a matter of years ago.
"I am afraid" he says.
'I am afraid that the army will arrest me; I fear I will be shot. '
Mr Yacco, his brother, confirms that the people of America do not dare to discuss this matter.
He tells us that he had been beaten by the soldiers when he had helped to burn four victims.
"Soldiers are looking to me after the victims burning" he says.
The Ampeal has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shoot villages in Pania's neighbouring region in Deiya.
One death and 17 injured in the conflict between the leader of the villages and the director of the building company, which began when the Director refused to take his life from the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24th year old, Rousanus Douw, who had had had to have access to water in the vicinity of the hospital who died on his way to the hospital.
The villages who were sunk demonstrated at the building site before the company's office.
According to the police, the villages stolen police officers who were responsible for warnings.
However, according to the local authorities, a paramilitary police unit in Indonesia opened up to a force of fire, with one village dying.
'We are horror; we are afraid of revenge, 'Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and sleep when the wounded were brought to treatment.
'I am hidden at home for two days'.
Mr Deiyain's Parliament has called for the police who have been shot to be held responsible and for the withdrawal of the mobile police service from the region.
Pakistan has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Middle Highlands of Me-, Monius, Dalai and Damalia, which live on the Papua Eve.
Many people have joined the OPapua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papuans with occasional attacks and kidnapping by the Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the OPMs are Panzania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In the name of the arrest and arbitrary imprisonment of thousands of people in Panzania, the army has responded to the captain in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never be returned.
Among the Panian people, Pania is known as a 'sad, forgotten place'.
Poverty is causing dissatisfaction.
In Enarotall, there are few rice sold, and that too is too expensive for local people;
As is the case.
People grow their food themselves: Mainly bars and to some extent fruit and press vegetables.
Cultivation is women's work, and one woman can have four or five batches.
Most of the crops are for the family, and the rest is sold with rhetoric.
Ten battles cost only 10 000 pounds.
In time, differences in the livelihoods of local and immigrant workers have increased and the number of transponders has increased since the opening of new routes to the Nairobi airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go more locally to educated and wealthier change.
Few people in the clergy have enough capital and know-how to make their own businesses competitive.
'young people do not want to remain a village because there is no work or money here ', Mr John Gobai, President-in-Office of the tribal council in Pania.
The ultra-peripheral Papua is a little overlooked in the world.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudo and Basta Longamp were expelled from Papua, despite their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kis Jokowi, Allowner of Human Rights Watch, he has not kept his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and promoted development by lifting the restrictions of renovation.
'The most acute eastward provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, have new risks: The refusal of a visa and the submission of a black list ', as stated in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that only neighbouring Papua is under pressure from the Indonesian Government.
In March, six countries in the Pacific - Tang, laughing, Palau, Tuvu, Marshall and the Solomon Islands - invited the UN Council on Human Rights to examine the 'numerous and widespread violations of Papua', including the amputation in Pania.
These countries have traditionally supported the liberation movement in Papua.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister, Arrmanatha Nasir, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that 'Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights violations'.
The local authorities want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the human rights envoy Kees Van bar, visited Jayayayapua at 4.5.17, met with silence and freedom, tells us that there was an anonymous persistent source.
There are 2019 presidential elections in Indonesia, but the Pashtuns tell us that there is probably no longer a vote in Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been confused with the amputation in Pania", Mr Gobai, President-in-Office of the tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know what the situation is for the people of the Albanians: They live under a lack of power and poverty, practically without health care and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, Jokowi 's votes, like other Pashtuns, are considered to be a' debt 'which must be repaid.
"They do not want money; they only want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the amputation in Pania once again demonstrated their resistance in symbolic terms: They burned one of the victims to a country which was opposed to the police force and the army headquarters.
They know that perhaps they will never get justice, but at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
My Permanent Member was killed, "Yascus says he is under pressure.
'What else can we do? '
The resurgence of Robert Helenius is shattered by Derck Chio: 'Even its own fanatics do not want to see'.
A heavy set of boxes, Robert Helenius and Dereck Chirana, was due to take place on 27 May in the Hartwaffolia.
However, this was cancelled for commercial reasons.
At a recent interview with IFL VT, Mr Chijack is swamped by the fact that a new intimidation is taking place to the detriment of Helmus.
My speech in Finland was flopped, but that was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell flags there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his father does not want to see him take the biscuit because he is unfortunate, Mr Chioni is paralysing.
For the first time, Helmut and Chirania met in full in December 2011.
Mr Helmut won the match by a controversial point sentence.
The turnover went smoothly and its projector, Nisse Sauerland, told Illows in May that it had been postponed until the autumn.
The match has not been anything new.
The cancellation, however, will no longer cause Mr Chibo to be regretted.
After all, it would probably have had to be cancelled after Chio's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the start of the match, I was giving rise to hard battles.
My Tyrenees were explosive.
It was said in the hospital that I had to be cut, that Mr Chio says.
The British is currently showing itself to be in order of around 455%.
In all respects, he is not interested in a new approach with Helmus, but in the assimilation of Diran Whype.
Mr Whype suffered a defeat in December.
The Taocha of the Techchiphery in Duba came to power again.
On Friday in Duba, hundreds of people were forced to flee 337 metres from a high 79th layer building.
This was the second piece of aid in two years' time in a building called Thch.
The building was cancelled and no one knows that it was injured, and there was no idea of fire immediately after the event.
'We were sleep and we got up with the alarm and people's calls.
On the 50th floor, which took ten minutes', George told Reuter.
According to the Duba civil protection authorities, the fire forces were allowed to come out of four a.m. for a local time and were left to stagnate.
The government announced that it would organise a accommodation for those who leave their homes.
The case may again give rise to questions about the safety of high buildings in various parts of the world.
Following the fires of 2015, the board of directors of the Trichch building carried out a study which found that the most damage was the distribution used for the breastfeeding and isolation.
In Britain, the police believe that Grenfe Tower boys in London could contribute to the rapid progress of the Lithuans in the fire, where 80 people died in June.
Mopo was stolen during the night from Joenotic park.
At 9 p.m., a mopo was stolen between 21 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
Mopo disappeared from an address to the Niinn risk, Titenus 2.
Mopo was bizarre Sky Team Monke.
It is red, and the register is 27th REV.
Mr Mopo was found later on Thursday.
The police are asking for a discovery of mopo or its admission by e-mail to be taken on board by e-mail is protected from swimmbosis.
Javier Script's support seems to me to be the same, or the number of police nuisance on telephone numbers is 0295 415 320.
At 3.8.2017 p.m. at 12.40 p.m.: The police informed us that mopo was found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers are involved in banned objects, reveal a survey.
A survey carried out on air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or without knowing that they had passed the TSA checkpoints; at least 6% of passengers had a boat or other objects that they did not know were banned.
Less than one per cent said that they were only then informed that they had transported weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers received a questionnaire and it was carried out by the Strare Jet Charters airline, and the results show that young passengers are more likely to be threatened than others.
19.7% of passengers who have deliberately violated the TSA rules were representatives of the Joint generation and less than 15% belong to the XG.
More generally, the rules were violated by exporting food and barriers to aircraft.
More than 3% of women gave their exports to aircraft consciously, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported banned medicinal products to their plane.
The company that carried out the questionnaire wanted to find out how many smugglers had passed a security check and how many had done so.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to take the smuggling goods over the security check - conscientiously or without knowledge.
However, as the questionable company states, the TSA guidelines are very complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what barriers can be taken and how many.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the majority of TSA confiscation confiscation is a barrier.
For some time, there was also the belief that the aircraft should not be allowed to take books.
Barriers must be taken to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
The Director-General of the US Environment Agency, Scott Prurt, wheeled his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obam period to reduce emissions.
The day after the 15 Member States had challenged the Director of the EFA, Scott Pruti, he withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken during the Obam Administration to reduce emissions.
According to Mr Pruuuge, the change shows that the agency he chair takes greater account of the needs of the decision-makers in the Länder.
Mr Pruuust did not say a word about the position he had taken against his previous decision in the Federal Appeal Court.
The Länder should begin to comply with the level of ground ozone from 2015 to 1 10.
In June, Mr Prurt announced that he would postpone the implementation of decisions by one year, so that his office would have more time to study the plan because the agency 'does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth'.
He was a public prosecutor of the Oklahman State before President Donald Trump appointed him as Director of the EPAP, who is known as opponents of stricter environmental rules.
Since the arrival in Washington, Prurt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change of mind of Wednesday is the last step towards relaxing the provisions of the Pruri plan.
Last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington ruled that the director of the EPA exceeded his mandate to try to delay the implementation of the Obam Administration Decision on oil and gas companies, which required companies to monitor and reduce metaphor leaks.
In a statement made on Wednesday evening, Mr Prutt stated that his U-turn on ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements according to the timetable.
During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected that activists and others would be challenging the right to agree on timetables, Mr Prurt said: In his previous action he challenged the environmental agency more than ten times before.
'We do not believe in the regulation that takes place through the trial and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
However, it was stated in the EPAP opinion that Prurt could continue to use its' powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers' to ensure that the provisions are 'justified and are based on the best available information'.
In Congress, the Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone rules.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Mr Eric Schneider, the general prosecutor of the New York State, who has been tried by the EPAP this week, stated that it was going to continue to exert pressure.
'The EPAD change of mind as a result of our complaints is a considerable victory for the 6.7 million neworians and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct effects of smoke in their communities', as Mr Schneider said.
Not only in New York, but also in California, Cotic, Delaware, Illinois, Illinois, Iowa, the reputation, Massachusetts, Mexico, Orego, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Dutstrite of Columbia.
Ozone in the landscape is born when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemicals plants, for example, are reacted in the atmosphere to sunlight.
Such a smoke could cause serious respiratory difficulties for vulnerable groups of people and also cause thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change in direction in Pruri.
'It is worrying how much pressure was demanded to use the common sense of our respiratory blood 'to say the centre of biodiversity of Lori Anan Burd.
'We must continue to fight against the Trentin regime, whose ideological objective is to act under the conditions of polluters and other groups in their own interests'.
The car manufacturer is coming into the street - 'happens in the tyre of Ferrarr'.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time trying to maintain its position on ecstasy.
This is likely to happen, but it will be at the crossroads of Ferrer, the Director-General, Sergio Marchio, said that plans were planned on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Autotototopian News.
All cases of the disaster in Austria, the same type of virus
The infection of the Ranner is the same type of virus as previous cases in the Austrian Savo, information on THL.
On Thursday, the Estonian laboratory of the Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth infection in the Baltic Savo is identical to previous infections.
THL has ensured that, on Friday 28 July, a penal person had the same type of infection as the former cases of Austria Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infectious infections in Austria are related to the first disaster in the region in June.
News is good, because it means that we have not seen any other type of ravage.
It is possible, however, that even until August, new infections can be brought to the attention of the Fifth Disease and therefore the epidemic has not yet been over, according to Mrs Mirkaeta Erkel, the doctor responsible for primary health infectious diseases.
New maps of rabies or suspicions have not come to light since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone should ensure that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date, as the Erkel reminds us.
Further to this point: Three new maps of wash infection have been ascertained in the Piravina - 'Lisänder infection or epidemic very unlikely'.
Finland is preparing for an authorised kilogram.
The Pontform was not even considered to be legalised.
The underlying argument is that the process, along with wine, produces molluscs which are toxic.
The preparation of Kilei at home will be legal next year, but the legalisation of the photographs will not even be considered.
Kileu is being prepared for use, with a photograph once again.
Behind the regulation of Tislase, there is a justification for the fact that the process produces not only wine but molluscs, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the photographs as a right for each man, a government advice to bring Ismo to the Ministry of Social and Health to the attention.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of alcohol law, it was not considered that the photographs would be legalised.
It was not put on the political table either.
There was no debate on liberalisation, Mr Outi Mäkuk.
He is at the negotiating stage of the group of government parties who took a stand on the reform of alcohol law.
At home, the licence for photographs cannot even be granted for an application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
Importation tells us that it is a simple rule for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages to be produced at home.
This means that, in addition to beer, sieder and wine, a kilo can now be done legally at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law abolishes requirements for flavourings and aromas and allows the manufacture of a kilo to be made more precise.
The manufacture still has to take place in such a way that the syndrome and aromatic substances that have arisen in the course of their use are clearly detected in the drinking.
According to the new law, drinks are allowed to produce as much as they wish, and the alcohol of their own can be given a gift.
Sales must not continue to be allowed to take place.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland.
Much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law is now before the Ministry of Justice.
As soon as the season begins, the Alstools Act will be submitted to the municipality.
The plenary is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House had already adopted a position.
Oscar Pisidus was stoned by armed guards in hospital.
Oscar Pistous, who suffered from the conflict, was stoned to the hospital in South Africa because of heart-related suspicions.
Pisidus has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pisidus is suffering from his prison sentence in Atteridge.
According to the British Mirror, Pistor was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistor suffered from breast clothes, but he got away from the hospital this afternoon.
The prison scientist confirmed that Pistou was taken to hospital research.
As far as the family scientist of the Pistor is concerned, the former top sportsman was concerned.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the murder of his daughter Reva Sinaur for six years in prison.
In February 2013, Piscius amassed Sun.
Telephone conversations reveal the pressure exerted by Mr Trentin on Mexico to build a border wall.
The telephone conversations between the American President, Donald Trentin, Mexico and Australia have leaked into Washington's mail.
During the telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Mr Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speech about not going to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States bought Nieto for having imposed a wall publicly; 'you cannot say so to the press', Trump said.
At the expense of Mexico, Mr Trum launched his presidential election campaign.
Washington Post also published a first telephone from Trimp to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbble, during which there was a great deal of exchange of views.
Mr Trump said to Mr Tubble that the agreement that the United States should include refugees travelling to Australia is ridiculous, 'wretched' and 'stupid'.
Mr Trum finished the telephone by saying to Mr Tububul that 'this was the most unpleasant telephone of all day'.
Georgia's massacre: Activists once again failed in the hope of the right of racist stagnation.
Ford Mercury is overtaking a number of people in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continuing their journey towards the small Moore's Ford.
The car has four black passengers and white drivers; four armed men went down the road before the car gets off the ground.
A team director, an average-age man who dwelled up a brutal blow to his heroic heroes and has a glass of wind.
Passengers are afraid.
'Roger, nuns! '
'Do't you! '
The horses are in breach of silence when a young black man comes out of the front.
Fortunately, this tragic incident is only a resurgence of the responsibility expressed at 2.7.2017.
However, the horror is real when the tyranny is shattered into the 'Roger' cake.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore 's Ford to reopen the events of 1946, when KKKu Klan pulled two black couples, Roger and Dorohy Malm, George and Mae Murray Dorsn.
No one has been prosecuted for murder.
'It is confusing that no one has been arrested over the last few years - even though the murderers live in our midst and many have to know who they are, 'Tyron Brook, who is helping to restructure.
"It is a disgrace of history, but, above all, it is a burden on our soul."
Brook is the 71th-year-old civil activist and former Georgian Congress.
It is a shocking invitation to him to act, and it also reminds the people of Monroee that the injustice has never been corrected.
'We want those responsible to be brought to justice; we want things finally to be brought to a conclusion, and we want to get back to grief and make reconciliation, but, above all, we want justice, Mr Brook says.
"We cannot recover and settle before we get justice."
The defendant hides the bodies of the victim who died in Georgia at 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI reports, more than 50 men from Monroee and the circles around it were suspected of a dawn.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty parties have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives of the plaything have always been known at local level: Politics and that is the case.
In 1946, the black people of the State of Georgia were allowed by the Supreme Court to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, which took their decision in April and which took place in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident in the run-up to the elections in which a black goat farmer Roger Malcom had a white owner, Barnet Hester, in a toy which apparently concerned the wife of Malitam Dorohy.
According to Broat, the town was ruined that Heter had a relationship with Dorothyy and that Dorotu expected this children.
According to information from the FBI, a powerful white farmer, Ly Harris, paid USD 25.7.1946 to the 600 dollars released from prison.
On their way home, Malorin and Dorothu were followed by their coup Murra and George Dorsy.
Before Moore's Ford their car was stopped by force.
'It transpired that Harris had a farm and organised murders', the FBI report states.
'It is also obvious that there was a confidentiality between the state and the local authorities, which were involved in the murder and lost the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses'.
Mr Brook will be more succinct.
"It was a murder of voting rights."
'they were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that they will do the same if they are going to vote '.
Cassaddra Gree has been directing the resurgence of Georgia for almost a decade.
The proposal is extremely realistic and imprison, which is a description of the appalling racism which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It is difficult to look at the proposal, but it is even more difficult not to see what is meant by Mrs Grent.
'We do not want to talk about a plaything because we would have to face our own dark side ', the director says.
'but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you do not hear me or you do not want to hear what I have experienced '.
On the first day around 30 samples - a dozens of black boxes and a couple of White Papers - met to listen to the routine synthesis of the Greent.
Wade Marbaugh is the Deputy Director of the Green.
He has been presenting a local KKu Klux leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and odious.
"Will be dirty because I am not my own", Marbaugh tells us.
'It is important, however, that this aspect of history should also be taken up so that it is never repeated again '.
On the other side of the bad news, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Ratsconi, Roger Malcom and Barnet Hester, are carrying out their words.
The proposal starts with a situation in which Malcom awaits and my work, Heter, who is razed by the fact that Heter has had a relationship with Dorotu.
"Did I not hear?" I said that my country was absent? "
Ratconta, Heister, is responsible.
Then there is the puppet.
And everyone (at least all black exhibitions) is shaking their laurels.
Gree laughing hardest.
'What? '
He is ashamed of nothing.
'I am too firm in the face of the damage '.
The 'no', Gree.
"I do not think the white people used the word" at the time. "
The second black samples will be confirmed.
'This is a jargon; you must use a longer version '.
The subject of this proposal is unpleasant, but poor power in blood.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of a motion, but because they want to respect the memory of those who have died.
The attack begins.
Now, the words of Mr Rasconconn were huge.
Nobody laughter.
New responsibility will end quickly and in a violent manner.
Auction, flowers - and silence.
A woman living in a black cemetery is standing alongside the bodies and flew to the Billi Holiday Strange Frurs paragraph.
His voice is shattered in every other word.
At the end of a few 10 metres, ten spectators bought nothing and tears in their eyes.
Nearly half of the public is black and half white.
There is a parish who has come to look at the proposal from Ithaca to New York, but most are local.
They have been at the helm of Mr Broxen, who has been at the helm of the victims, in a retaliation that is under pressure from Georgia.
The killings have turned out to be a story; the emotion on the ground is heavy.
Following a snapshot, Gree will be invited to check the bodies.
Children thrive to look at the blood and the body that is not mobile, and dwells each other.
"They have not really died," a small boy, but just to remind themselves of themselves.
In a few minutes' time, Mr Gree will be grateful to the public.
The samples who have been sent to the bosses disassociate their hatred and shake up the tears.
Bradhaw shake a Marbaight, a man from the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Ratscona will have two samples and will then come into tears after a tough proposal.
The woman involved in the proposal is happy.
'We know that you are not.
You did so for good. "
Later, the public and the spectators will meet together in a common dinner.
The White House, which has come from the premises, is in lively debate with the black parent that it has just met.
It is difficult to find words in Denus Dup when he describes the emotions raised by the motion.
'It is difficult to listen to the horrendous words and to look at the terrible acts that are being said and committed by people who appear to be the same as they are - precisely because they appear to be the same as they say '.
'I found that there are still stakes, 'he added,' they are only called arrests'.
On the other side of the bad news, Mr Brook recalls the development of citizens' rights to the same hearing.
He already tells us that he has started planning next year's proposal.
It is a powerful experience because it reflects the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a learning experience, a Brook word.
'It is the message that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeating it. "
The elimination of this' supernumerary parts' actually saves.
Is it permissible to dissociate the flowers from the shop even before the balance is weighed?
What about taking away a large proportion - how many prints?
The answers are very much divided: For one person it shows the virtue of nasty to the extreme, while others do not want to pay for those parts which are not used and which are still going to go at home to scrap.
The phenomenon is, of course, recognised in the shops.
For example, the Estonian department of the Ruohop Gulf of Helsinki, the KKity City of the Ruotic Estonian Gulf of Helsinki, has a freezer box, because many of them are torn apart, for example, from the flowers of the flowers of the flowers.
The cows are exported to biowaste.
According to reports published by the Talousis, nasty in vegetables wonders about traders.
But how much money will it be possible to remove the surplus parts of vegetables before the balance is weighed?
How important is it?
We women would test how the price will change when the press or positions will be taken away from ancient, ladder, sledgehammer, paralytical and flowers.
The consumer: EUR 1.0 was the price of a flowers paying EUR 2.10, when the photograph was removed from all the newspapers.
Anans: The price of a total grant of EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position fell out.
The rubber: The price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut out.
Cat pigs: Two nerves cost 75 cents.
Without these stocks, 60 cents became a price.
Parsama: The medium-sized parent paid EUR 1 and no position of 80 cents.
The end result is that if newspapers and stocks leave their way, it will save a few dozens of cents at best for one vegetation.
As per cent the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
These purchases would therefore have saved a total of EUR 1.0!
Neymar was buried out of Barcelona - the bishops agreement with the PSGs for five years.
Brazil's star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the PSGs, an AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was said that the representatives of Neymar had paid football for the FC in the Spanish league at Barcelona of EUR 222 million.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest transfer in football history.
Earlier on, the record was in Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million in French Paul Pog last summer.
The Spanish league blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company by representatives of Neymar.
According to the rules of the oligarchy, a buying club cannot pay for the purchase price directly to the dealer, but a player must buy out the contract itself, by recycling money through a league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the amount to Neymark and to the representatives who provided the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymarin is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be presented to the new home public in the opening of the PSGs to Aeilia on Saturday.
UEFA is investigating the details.
Barcelona also told us in its communication that it would provide information on payments to Uepal, so that the European Football Association can identify possible disciplinary measures.
The President of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, among other things, is suspected of violating the rules of the UEFA financial fair game.
UEFA can punish the consequences of a loss of over EUR 30 million over three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic article.
The transfer of Neymar to PSGs will affect the club economy for many years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
PSG, for example, could sell several players with substantial sums of information from Uepal.
The PSGs owned a government-owned company, Qatar Sporto Initiative.
As President of the club, a former theatre, the Khmer Roulafi, is in office.

Auti, 21 of them received severe fire injuries from a secret attack - a script deposit on the airport's safety cake.
Auto Dunn was in the process of carrying out normal working measures for aircraft with a couple of working workers at the international airport, when at times one of the hundred biscuits was thrown into a pocket.
The force of the secret thrown into a container in the country of Dunn, which is close to the ship.
Mr Dunn was rushed into the hospital.
He had a third-rate fire rate across his body.
My father beg me and told me that he had an electricity attack and he is in a hospital.
I asked him whether he was alive, Austine said.
Two weeks ago I was in a hospital.
Apart from the fires, he had meat bag and brain drain.
It was a hard experience for the whole family.
That is not the kind of thing we can expect.
It is traumatic for everyone, as Mr Autum says.
According to the airport spokesman, the deterrent system of encryption was at the time of the case and the transport movement itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting back on share.
My British training team, Pearson, announced that he would reduce 3 000 jobs on Friday and cut the share by 72% when he launched a new structural programme in response to pressure from their businesses.
According to the Executive Director John Fallon, job losses are being carried out mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, a company which has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by USD 300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme, in order to reinvigorate a business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Mr Pearson decided to sell his share of Pengu Random House to his partner, Bertelsman, who declared that he had the same prospects for this year, with a turnover of GBP 2.50 billion in the first half of the year.
The attack in Kabul was supported: NATO soldiers died in suicide bombings.
The suicide bombers attacked military support in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, which claimed that NATO soldiers and many others were killed.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were killed in the attack in the Quarabi region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month; on Tuesday, 30 people were killed by an explosion in the mosques in Heat.
On Monday, two people died in the attack by suicide bombers in the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO 's opinion, on Thursday evening, the explosion occurred when the NATO / Afghan army was subjected to the attack on its own explosive machine.
It was stated that the situation of all those injured was stable and was dealt with in the American military hospital at Balag airport.
According to the Kyrgyzstan exchanging parties, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISA in Quarabright are major concerns for NATO forces near Balag.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom are in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, which mainly lives from Chechens.
The Taliban declared themselves to be behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, an attack on the country's most devastating militia since the US-led forces were plunging the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the turnover in Kyrgyzstan, the suicide attacks in Kabul have also greatly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghanh.
The EPA is wheeling its decision to postpone the implementation of the cooling regulations.
The United States Environment Agency, the Earth Agency, took its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken under the Obam administration, which would reduce emissions by rainfall, a day after the 15 states had challenged the Agency to court.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called 'ozone definition' of 2015 late on Wednesday, which states that it is a commitment to cooperate with the Länder.
'We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder ', the Director-General, Scott Prurt, said in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Mr Prurt announced the intention of the agency to postpone the implementation of ozone levels by one year to October 2018, which, according to extremes, is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency challenged 15 states, mainly democratic, including the Duttri of Columbia, which said that postponement was illegal.
President Donald Truder's regime has sought ways of mitigating the early environmental provisions of Bakck Obama, which, more importantly, is part of a broader programme for economic growth.
More measures have been taken against democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the effects of an increase in emissions on health.
According to the EPAs website, air breathing 'containing ozone can undermine the operation of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma'.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, someone belonging to Isman had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion is that the bomb was due to be carried out on 15 July, but the company suspended before the inspection.
The police do not tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a non-colourful glass of toxic gas and to take a plate to the public place, for example a public transport instrument.
The Deputy Commander of the Australian Federation, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On Saturday, as a result of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police guards.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings are also continuing.
Nesky's executive director: Renewable fuels were well off.
The result of the oil refineries, Mr Nesky, fell before taxes, but lax forecasts for the second quarter.
According to the Executive Director, Matti Lievoke, the company produced a good result in oil products, the sales volume of renewables increased to record levels, and the turnover in the marketplace and Servicus segment was heading in the right direction.
Last year, comparative business profits improved the American tax relief on Blenders Tax Credes.
According to Life, the business profits of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales rates and a more favourable market, even though tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete the strategic investment we announced earlier in 2017, as Mr Liese said in the communication.
Movy Garcia and Vayl Lomake will discuss possible matches at their first meeting.
Mr Vaystal Lomakov and Mr Garcia, who should be on a collision course, met with the most interesting boxing in the near future of a set of less than 66.7kg, met on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their seats in the ESPNT canal channel in Los Angeles until the wretched Koscia Garcia winner of the WBC broke to welcome Lomake Chechenko, the leader of the WBO.
On Saturday Showster, the former four champions of the world, AdR Broner, was able to take a unanimous decision, and since then Garcia and Lomako have been among the five best on the list of boxing boxes.
Mrs Garcia gave her right hand and asked: 'What is going, what is the master?
Good luck! '
Mr Lomako defends his term against Mr Miguel Marriga on Saturday's season of the ESPNN.
When the two boys to photographs, the Church of the Church, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the distinction between men would be complete with regard to the size.
"I am a former lady", Mrs Garcia reminded us.
'I moved on to a series of superiors [63.5 kilograms) for British, but I am not so large.
I am a small size of 63.5.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light.
He has to rise in a litany [61.2 kg), and we can then take it.
That is what we want.
Let us fulfil their wishes. "
Mr Lomake agreed.
"Boxing needs this match."
Mr Klimaos asked whether this should be organised by means of a payment channel, which is part of his strategy to Mr Lomake, that he would also be looking at the issue of the Lomaf deyrokay in a litany later this year and that he will be buying next summer against Garcia (370, 30 contingency profits), and that he would also be interested in attacking Jorge Limge and Camphol in Camparrimarrima and Lusta on 23 September.
'There could be a payment channel because fanatics have asked for it ', Mrs Garcia said and later declared that she was prepared to take the lead that offers the best compensation package.
'We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets so much attention.
As soon as an agreement is reached... '
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomahenko as a 'incredible broker' and that he would perhaps be looking at Saturday's match.
Mr Lomako interrupted the praises of Mr Garcia and said that this three-class championship from Riversideo seemed to be very slow.
Garcia said that he had focused first on the deployment of force and then on boxing.
Men said they felt that there was an increasing desire to bring about a match between them.
'This is the sort of discrimination that is expected.
There is less attention and less interest in any other approach.
I am definitely involved in this event, Mrs Garcia said.
Mr Lomako said that he was waiting for him to come up against the best.
It will be a great deal of compassion. "
Average wages of EUR 5 300, education and training - the situation of investment advice has been 'cotton and free'.
The quality of investment advice has been much talked about recently.
Most recently, the Helsinki messages told Mr Riva, Mr 68, where the investor adviser of the bank bankers spoke of a complete puppet in his sale of investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the various sales of investment products will be stricter at the beginning of next year.
Tightening up is based on the new financial market directive, which is due to be applied from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisers and those who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There is no legal definition of the requirements of excellence.
The Financial Service (FA) itself recommends that those who work in the investment services carry out their own APVI or APV2 research.
The finance sector has been a catalyst for the organisation of qualifications for the APVs Oy, with experts from both the Fover Group and the industry.
Studies are between 1215 and 15 study points, and their scope is to draw up a wave of EE-development services.
It is said on the net site that, in general, both sides are very broad in terms of requirements.
The training material of diplomas is 1015 books and many other dogmas and works.
The AVT investigative surveys, Markka Savikko, tell us that the level of nuts is around 70.
As far as the staff of the largest banks are concerned, more or less all investment services have carried out either the APVI or the APV2 study, because they are obliged to carry out them under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bank bankers without mentioning the names of those whose staff appear to have cleared up their qualifications, Mr Shav says.
According to him, there are 'a few such bankers'.
According to Shevitis, the APV1E study has been carried out since 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 people and by some 3 000 people who are in favour of more demanding investment advisers.
Some bank bankers see it as an advantage to carry out a study.
There are considerably stricter requirements of excellence in more other areas of activity.
The whichever says that the financial recommendation requires that the APVT diplomas be carried out, because that is where the competence of the investment sector is ensured.
According to the Treasury Centre, the financial and investment advisers spend several thousands of euros a month on average, including projections, natural interests and income premiums.
The average average age of regular working time is around EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work in this area spend over EUR 5 900 per month and women spend more than EUR 4 500.
On average, the tenth increase deserves around EUR 8 100.
The tenth of men who are most involved deserves more than EUR 9 000 per month, or more, ten-tenth of women who are the most familiar, or more than EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the ISD can only be provided by a licence company.
So far, self-regulation has been created at the level of employees and tasks.
According to Mrs Frahm, the inspection carried out received individual cases where the professionalism and competence of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the work of the advice.
In principle, the purchaser of investment products can also act even if skills and qualifications are at a low level.
From this point of view, the situation has been cotton and free.
There are considerably stricter requirements of excellence in several other areas of activity, as Mr Sakharko states.
According to Sheikh, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up by the new Financial Market Directive (MFID II).
This presupposes that every company responds to the fact that investment services are adequately equipped.
Financial control, on the other hand, is authorised to determine what should be done.
Marko Hovi, the market controller, tells us that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investment dealers.
According to the plastic, the new requirements apply both to the staff of the investment firms themselves and to those who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hoi tells us that, according to a proposal from the Finance Minister, Fava has the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are, the decision will be taken during the next autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, where necessary, monitoring and training.
All this must be documented, and the company has an obligation to prove that it has done so.
Hovi makes it clear that in practice, for example, the company will have to analyse the activities of staff at individual level.
This will certainly be the case, depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the plastic, a new requirement is also a requirement to work with a more experienced period if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company employs a new employee who does not fully meet the criteria, the employee will have to work with a person who meets the criteria.
According to the plastic, the rules will become more stringent and more practical.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be stricter at the beginning of 2018.
The picture is that 787 Dreamlin passenger aircraft had a 'giant aircraft' to the United States.
A plane was thrown into the hands of the United States by the Flighghtra service.
On Thursday 787 Damiler aircraft were carried out, which tested the sustainability of the aircraft 'Rolls Royce engines on a long haul.
In the next 18 hours and 1 minutes, a machine leaving Seattle 15 700 km longer than any permanent commercial carrier in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States.
This will be done by a total of 17 states.
The persistent pensioner schoolchildren in Itra will not be helped by the same or sunshine Pope - with the help of Iines Kyrup's stubborn bathing village.
Iines Kyrenee's machine was well off, always following Itkov.
The Itra bathing schools will be passing through Lie and Lembria this week and next week.
Although, between now and now, they are fleeing again, young bathers are not the same thing, Tevery Inkov is the pupil of bathing schools.
In bathing schools this week, 13 children will be affected, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that schools and escalates are already beginning to take stock of Inkov.
The town of Itra is organising a project for combining sport and a town of Iturra.
On Thursday, the bathing beach was a nice gesture.
The sun dreams and young bathers treating the surface with bathing clubs, someone already.
The smaller guerrilla arts also fell in water.
Iines Kyrosta, 5, first thought that a deeper step would be taken.
He was always, however, encouraged by Mr Itkov to burn his finger.
Fine!
Iines Kyrup said that he had visited a great deal of bathing this summer.
The beaches are good for him.
Like Iines Kynkow, there was a stubbornnnnnnnly sledgehammed with the bathing village, Vili Hushkann, 5.
You too can be satisfied with what has been achieved today, the bathing thing thing thing.
Jcius Kallio, 4, wanted water wars in the meantime.
Ilona Villberg, a daughter from his daughter, Anna Villberg from the coast, sees the penal school as a good start to the teach.
Although the weather has been what happens, Anna, every day, is stuck here.
Sometimes we had to heat.
Upper schoolchildren were thrown on the floor.
Boys were enough to live up to the fines found on the coast.
Milia Lusarkhai, 3, and Anna Villberg spread blankets, photograph fruit and damper day.
In water, education continued, but there was no rush on the plates.
When it does not belong in the summer.
An unknown military is sold into the water harvests - 'This is a semo-unifying story'.
It is perceived in all respects.
A few days ago, the Sivil Product, which manufactured Sius products, filed a series of unknown military products.
In other words, there are sledgehammers and seasoners - as well as' ware and rare league '.
The unknown military refers to the film and leftovers coming from the beginning of the autumn.
There is, however, something peculiar in the combination, and products have been marred in the social media: When will the health ties of Tuntour come from?
We must call a company and ask ourselves what it is all about.
What does the Deputy Director-General of the Siberian Product, Mrs Aino Musta?
We are a partner for film.
We are supporting this film, as we do many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and gold film, Munta says.
According to him, products become specialised in movements, and the film is therefore visible.
Is there not something to be desired - often when you think that there is something common with products and associated stories?
Yes, we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Munta says.
According to him, the company supports the same fundamental values as those of Finland, which are supported by those who have seen an old unknown military.
And cleaning up is not outside the army 's culture either, as Mr Mussa points out.
Other partners in the cinema, such as Valio, Hartwaw, Saldo, VR and rain, are unknown.
Up to now, for example, the Hartwallah lit has been placed on the market, which is found in the Ro, Hietta and Koskela.
Tour products have already been bisculated by the Finnish Kukvisi Kala in Kinanu.
There are already coffee and clock available.
I should like to point out that there is still time for a film to be first, so there is still a promise.
Unknown cooperation partners have not yet revealed their military products such as Valio, processors, Nesesestra and the German retail chain, Lidl, Kianne.
New tests for asylum seekers in Sweden
The most recent results of medical tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published, and the results of the new evaluation methodology reveal that the test was set at over 80% over 18 years old, but not all of them see the tests as reliable.
The Swedish National Medicines Agency started the test earlier this year.
This test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Migration Agency has so far carried out 6 880 tests, and the Legal Affairs Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
With regard to the 80% tested, 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18th years and, in 25 cases, the Judicial Agency established that the test was' possibly 18 or older '.
The 432 cases concluded that asylum seekers are 'possibly under the age of 182'.
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was cause to doubt the age announced by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Legal Service tells us that the results are in line with the results of previous months.
'The figures are fairly uniform and there are no great differences in statistics in recent months' he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were defined to be over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that they have been informed of their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and stated that 442 cases had "indications that an 18-year-old or parent had to be investigated."
When Speat Dagblad examined the same results, it became clear that in 243 cases the applicant had openly announced that he would meet this year's 18 years.
The medical diagnosis method used in tests takes the images of wisdom and magnetic photographs of polemics, and then hammer doctors and radio logistics analyse the images, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrine Claude Marcus of the Karolinn Institute, whose work includes an evaluation of people's biological maturity, which makes it possible to ascertain whether a person has been murdered before or later.
'I have had reason to think about this, and I do not think that the method used is the right one.
The definition of biological life in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not able to determine the age, we should not pretend that we are able to do so, he said to the Metroika newspaper.
However, if the test were to be precise, the Legal Service Göransson would say: 'Generally, the risk of designing a child as a adulthood is small.
The greatest risk is in a situation in which the test will soon have to fill 18 years, with the risk of around 10%. "
Ilonen's collapse of 30 seats in Scotland
Five more par results in the third round took Mikko Ilosa's 30 articles to the downward golf competition in Europe in Scotland.
At the end of the round, Ilon left 11 instead of Saturday, but it found 41 instead of dividing.
Ilosta was collected in a difficult dealer following three Bog, one sunshine labogg.
Others were also difficult.
The English person, Ian Poulter, stood up to share the leading seat in one of the par rounds, even though he said that there was enough work in the hands of the savage.
Keli was a raw material, but it was a good day, Poulter wind.
He shares his fellow countryman Calm Shinkwi and Australian Andrew Doard.
The Governor of West Virginia is changing party.
On Thursday evening, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justuice, announced that he would change a party during the Trenampi campaign.
"Democrats simply rejected me", Mr Justine said.
'I can tell you today, after many praises and thorough deliberations... 'I shall tell the Western Estonians that I cannot continue to help you as a governor of democracy'.
The public was able to meet with fierce applause.
"Tomorrow, the Republican Party" added.
'Since, I would say to you that it is time for a new game '.
Mr Trum promised earlier that an important announcement would be made in the campaign in West Virginia.
Mr Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justine did not support the democratic candidate, Hillry Clinton.
Justuice was elected as Governor in 2016, and according to Forbie he is the only billions in his state.
He withdrew his father from the mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth around USD 1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday evening that 'Governor Justicick's change of party is another blow to a democratic party which is building barriers rather than better America'.
The 'democrats' have only 15 governors and less Länder than ever before; in this situation, Mr Justich's announcement is the last setback for a party which has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive, united message, RNCs McDaniel, in his statement to the news of the BS.
Salamas sow the damage - on Thursday even the summer's anniversary.
More Euskera is also to be found in Euskera Finland.
Over the past week, particularly in the central and northern regions of the country and also in the Varsiams Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the mysterious attacks caused several fires.
According to Motoropic, Thursday may become a very turbulent day of the summer.
They have finally found Finland too.
Over the past week, it has been encryption, especially in the central and northern regions of the country and also in the Variams region of Finland.
By staying, the secret struck the electricity centre of the house with a small fire.
The fire was reported by the Pelascular Office to the tune of around half a night on Wednesday.
The Shkimp Centre was located at the end of the winter.
The Pelasty factory shut down the fire and the wall in order to find fire spots and sow the firewood.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
On the other hand, a secret boasted into the headphones of the building by Harritto before midnight.
When a rescue facility was deployed, the building was in full swing, and the rescue facility could only prevent fire spreading.
The whole external building of about 50 square metres has been rewarded to the ground.
On the other hand, the secret struck their own house in Räkka.
The people of the house were outside the building and proved to be a cruel blow.
The bureau was there to check the case, but this time the secret did not produce fire - only a few clouds.
The traffic crash caused problems with the railway line between the river and Vatanen when the traffic control system was damaged by the crash.
On Thursday morning, information about the innocent was provided between eight and nine, after which the train was replaced by a line.
The problem was only resolved a little before five afternoon.
Since then, rail transport has been able to continue on a normal basis with a husbandry line.
Salamas have sown the destruction across Finland.
This has, however, been relatively limited this summer.
These summer's utilities have been quite extraordinary.
Wednesday and Thursday's sleight of hand have been mostly targeted, but, thanks to the little secrecy of the summer, it too seems strong.
This may seem a powerful miracle, but that is what it has been in comparison with this summer 's bullet, Mr Tovine' s words.
On Wednesday, the country secrets fell 1 700 times, and on Thursday there has been a potential even for the hardest sleep day of the summer: By around 16 p.m. there were 1 790 secrets in the sceptics.
If the encryption continues at the beginning of the evening, it will be possible to predict more than two thousand encryptions.
The previous year of record weakness was in 2015, with around 30 000 paragraphs.
By Wednesday this year, 18 386 secrets had been kept secret.
There is, therefore, still a need to draw attention to the fact that this year does not break the 'record' two years ago.
However, the Ukrainer can expect to continue.
According to Mrs Todvine, Finland is still in the air at the end of the week in a warm and reprisal manner, which is the environment that is conducive to the goats.
The main focus of these pigs will be to move from north to south on Saturday, where about 2 000 days of secret may be available both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a greater degree of rainfall in the middle of the country.
According to such a crowd, there is only a slip in the sand.
Mr Co praises Russia's' generous' apologies for the scandal of doping.
The global sports bomb in Sebastian, which was described by Russia by the doping scandal on Thursday, added that it was not time to put an end to the ban on Russia's participation.
On Thursday, the Russian leader of the General Sport, Dmitri Shlyriani, said that the ban on doping in Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said that he regrets' for all the athletes who were taken to compete with the golden or heatwave '.
Despite his comments, the IAFF Congress voted in favour of the ban, which was excluded from the competition in general sport in November 2015 after the evidence of state support for doping in Russia had been presented in the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
'I think that his reply today was very direct, and it was a very generous presentation ', Mr Coe, the President of the IAF, told journalists.
"The entire Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation of Sport recognised that it had gone through difficult times and declared that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities."
Mr Co also said that he was' satisfied 'with the fact that Russia accepted the conditions for a ban.
'I think we have had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the working group's recommendation that it is not the time to put an end to the Russian ban ', as Mr Co said.
'We must do all we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean sportsmen separately from the corrupt system, he added.
Nine Russian sportsmen and women compete with the status of neutral sportsmen in MMMM, who have met the strict criteria of the IAF.
Mr Andersen, the leader of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
'Testing is still inadequate and the whoever has been banned continues to operate freely', he told journalists on Friday after his proposal to the Council of IAF in London.
The company Tom of Finland was disappointed by the poor success of the film.
Tom of Finland did not become the success that the perpetrators wanted.
To be honest, I am disappointed by the fact that the film-producing leader, Mr Anka Suckdorf, has been involved in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film public might be conservative and it seems to be.
The film came from first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had achieved more than 100 000 spectators in relation to the film budget, around EUR 5 million.
There was no merchandise from this, but it is now important for investors to get their own house back.
If the film had been more successful in their own country, they would already have obtained their money.
We now have to wait for a small photographical externalisation, Suckdorf.
Tom of Finland is a film driven by Dome Karu.
How will the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona to Paris in Paris, Paris Saint Germain, which is the costly transfer of football all the time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint Germain (PSGs) will be decided by the UEFA, which will be able to prevent the participation of teams in the valued Megean league.
In 2011, the UEFA introduced fair play in the economic rules, according to which the PSGs must be able to show that Neymar transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian Agreement, and the Neymar annual salary is going to move around tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves many economic aspects.
PSGs has no difficulty in paying for the transfer of Neymar and linking him to the stars because of the funding of a wealthy government in Qatar.
Clubs may use large sums of money to buy players, but they must be balanced on real sources of income so that football-related business is not a loss.
Fair play was established on the initiative of the French Michel Platin, who was elected as President of the UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Mr Platii thought that the quest for success in debt was a sham and caused serious problems if banks and owners had their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play was the transfer from clubs' debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that, for the first time, the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovines in Ceasefire in 2003 was made much more difficult by the huge amount of money spent on articulated purchases and created a global British.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play in the economic rules will last until 2018, when clubs will be able to do up to EUR 30 million.
Although my Platilli had to leave the role of the President of the UEFA scandalous in 2015, Alexander CEF would also like to curb the unscrupulous use of money by clubs.
The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future, a fair game of economic rules, Andrea Trverso, in UEFA, told the press office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar one-off from its agreement, it can spend the amount in the accounts for the whole duration of his new agreement.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded for the next five years.
The first sanctions were distributed on the basis of fair economic rules in 2014, the main sanctions imposed on the PSG and the Manchester City, which is funded from Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to restrict its Mestagan team to 21 players over the period between 2014 and 2015 instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is watching clubs which may try to circumvent its economic rules by increasing their income through companies involved in the owners of the club.
If, for example, a legitimate company supports the PSGs, but the value of this aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, the UEFA will not calculate aid as a real income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Aviation Authority for PSGs had been overstepped.
It has also become clear that some of Mr Neymar 's credit could be paid to PSGs in Qatar by means of contributions from the MMMPs of Qatar in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Executive Committee have banned Neymark from making MEFA the envoy of MPs, which it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal.
As a result of the PSGs' earlier sanctions, UEFA is following companies more closely than usual by circumventing the rules.
On Thursday, the sources of the situation told us that UEFA had not negotiated with the PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview with the Assoccupad Presus Office on condition that their identity is not brought to light because they do not have the power to discuss the situation in the PSGs.
According to the latest public accounts, the PSGs turnover in 2015 to 2016 was EUR 542.4 million and business profits amounted to over EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of products and games.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly irritated from the departure of the best player in the world, attempted to hinder the transfer of Neymar, which was alleged to violate the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear case of financial doping, both for the club and for the State", Javier Tebas, the President of the Spanish league, said to the Spanish newspaper, Mr Javier Tebas, who referred to the possession of the PSGs.
Arsenal Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which owns the American sports boy.
"This is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Mr Wenger said on Thursday.
'everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair economic rules, with so many interests that the famous player represents a state.
It is now urgent: The power of Finnish MMPs in Helsinki
The holder of the Philippine Gulf and the tripartite Kristiina Kristiina Mäkka Ghaza, is drinking in Helsinki, even though he should lighten a general sport in MMishop in London.
Mr Muskelta may have to compete without the advice of his accomplices.
Tomorrow, the Pyrenees will be competing in the crashing of the length of the period and Mäkuelta on Saturday in the triangle.
However, Mr Ghharza, the archambers of the Church, have not received a visa in Great Britain.
Mr Ghharza has tried to deal with this issue at a great moment in Britain without success.
In the past, there is a call for MMGs to carry a documentary, but that too has not been able to obtain a visa.
I wonder whether this is the first symptoms of Brexitis, or what Jorma Kem said.
He has always managed visa issues successfully in the past, but there is now a problem.
He will do everything he can to get there.
Mr Ghharza has been working for years for the Finnish URBL.
It is not so important.
As long as anyone sees the stadium as the stadium, Arta Paul said his livelihood was about possible removal.
Mashmir Finland demands a miracle from London.
The MMMPs of general sport are starting today in London on Friday and will last at the end of a week at the end of Sunday on 13 August.
Universal sport, the landscape and the globe are the species on which Finnish pensioner sportsmen and women have a passionate attitude from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
Success in the hearts of Turkish sportsmen and women is measured.
There are, of course, other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young sportsmen and women from each other, where experience is being gained by sportsmen and women to the level that adults Mashmir are genuinely possible.
Now, there are no young sportsmen and women in the small MMMM in Finland, and yet there are no quonies.
Mashmir Finland is asking a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and astonishment of sport are that miracles too can happen.
It draws the pensioner sportsmen around the television screen and springs to watch the cats, even though the London landscape is only late in the evening due to the resignation.
Twenty-2015 of the previous Multilateral Games in general, Finland received one protocols.
Mr Tero Pitski, a pensioner, brought it to light.
The Uskraws are now waiting for Pitska to see the results of the past few days of his and other discards, as well as the Pitska stagnation in the clouds of values last summer.
Whatever happens in these cats, the Pittaku remains a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Access to final competition for other Finnish athletes is a good achievement.
The realistic mindset of Finnish sport in the years to come is a good success in the international values of young people this summer too.
The processing of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite of representatives.
Success will not be at once, but will require years of hard work for sportsmen and women to be patient, both in the light of the light and in the case of pensioner sportsmen.
The Finnish people also appreciate the international sporting stars and enjoy their unique performance.
I hope that the London Games will remain the cats of Usain Bol and Mo Fairah, for example not because of the fear of terrorism or the cowardly attacks.
My En Rukavi secondly in Cot's big air - 'My regrets'.
The Lucian layer, En Ruvsky, has invested in the second big Air in Colrad in the United States of America.
Copher Mountina has become a cake in Rukamo's best big big Airl's world cup.
Jmie Andersen was won by the women's cup in the United States.
There were 147 points in competition.
He tried for the first time in the cats and was very close to success.
It is all very well and good, but it is a pity that the last smile did not go.
From now on, I will try to see one another in the cats, a wind in Ruvsky.
In the big air of floating, a competitor has shelved from a smile for a ferry.
The new high-speed vessel in Helsinki
The new rapid reaction vessel FSTR from Vikingen is seriously behind the timetable.
The Pashcay was due to leave Helsinki at 9 p.m.
In eight countries, the ship was landing.
The ship arrived late in Helsinki.
I have been waiting for at least one and a half hours to be allowed to enter the ship.
Now, a car queue is moving a little, the Estonian Johannes Rebati told us at 7.30 p.m.
Raiba believed that the new vessel had become a technical fault.
Mr Rebær told us that the shipping company had brought water bottlenecks waiting for their cars to enter the ship.
Mr Christa Garnd, the director of Vikingen's communications, says to the IIS that the law was a technical fault.
It was corrected in the port of Helsinki.
A ship starts a few hours late in Helsinki.
Garnd says that the ship is also delayed for a few hours.
The ship had to go back from Tallinn to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
Specialised transport by 42metres will disturb traffic on Thursday evening.
On Thursday evening, 42 metres of long specialised transport will move from Mukos to Mutol.
Transport from nine sources should be available by one evening to the next.
The police control traffic with the Knotwithstanding, and there is a risk of traffic being stopped at times.
Transport from Mälskar goes down the road 13 to the port of Mutol.
A small circle: The Zimbabweans will see American Sur and Comrad Detectic.
At the same time, both the days of the birthplace of the characters of the 80s and the gull of the 90s (at the time of David Wain and Michael Showalter, The States of MTS) and their own time - 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amos Pehler, Pudd and others moved into their larger pieces.
As a cultural product, it is both a paroc and a description of the continuing memorandum, which we have seen in the Faceo era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been out of date.
The First Day of Camp did surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (for example, it reported the background story of Jon Benjai), who speaks with his voice.
The crux of the joke is that the average-age samplers are showing passionate impulses that are approaching full-age, which makes the irreversible pursuit of the past a joke.
Years later, where adults appear to be adults, is less emotional, and its paradigm is more fragmented: For example, it suffers from scapegoats in the 90s, as the horror hand of cinema is speculating.
At one point, one of the protagonists needs to be mentioned by Aple Powerbo, the birds and the 'rest of 1991'.
Many stories are the same as they were in the past.
Mr Cop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but he has still not been able to cross the road.
Victor (Ken Marino) is still nice.
And in a mad drink, Ronald Reaga is also involved as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (whom Michael Ian Black quite rightly shows).
As always in such sarkes, the best is by-pages.
It is particularly nice to see a young Paul Rudd who is under the aegis, Matt Dillo's' Soul path path 'film Singles.
The moments of ludicrous madness may be raised to the plane of this SARS as a sort of rebellion, until it comes to a clear decision.
Amazon Comradit Deteach, on the other hand, appeals to another hegemony: To the spirit of the Cold War of America, to the Autic Blonde film, and even to the weight of the GLOWO in the West.
It has been created by the media by Brian Gatewod and Alxsandro Tanaka, which has led Rhy Thomas, a Roma police drama in the 1980s, where a bishops are fighting for truth, axis and Marxism.
In the main, the hard-naked Gregorina and the idealistic Iosephant is seen as Fleri Piersic Jr and Cofour Ulic, in English, Chaunning Talam, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is an excellent idea;
But much more than that.
There are a number of good whisky wounds (police spend time looking at television in the same way as the Americans see football).
There are a number of constituent voices, such as Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Maherska Ali and Choloomy Sevign.
However, Comrad Detective is too stupid to trace the socialist drama - there are hidden killings behind Reagan, for example - and so a series often starts to feel a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and a series of humour is not quick enough and is not abundant.
To summarise, a series of people could be more active as a polite harvest, for example when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly in the US Embassy and there are always two meat men in the aegis with hemp hemp.
The message to the Communist public is that western culture can make all the consumer room and food available quickly.
A series of imaginative Romanian creators were not wrong: We are being used to safeguard our own recent history and their history.
Mr Tolani Tururu, a Lukashenko, is on Saturday in Macau - in response to a former UFCs.
My colleague, Mr Tauru, wants to keep a match in place.
Tolan Tauru will receive his response in Macau with a great deal of effort, as the Brazilian Leando was still in the UFCC last year.
Brazil also has the black belt and the World Cup of the species.
For once, I am against my parents.
It is a bag, it is a 322th year old, Mr Tauru.
Last Saturday, the Latvian people had to rise in Indonesia.
It was cancelled because of logistical problems, but there was a quick timetable for the Chinese Autonomous Community in Macau.
Turu has not been subjected to this in the past.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was irritated because it took a lot of time to prepare and tread.
However, the Ottawa is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
Waiting for a week has little to do with preparing.
The transfer will not affect the order, as it will not improve in a week.
A condition can go even worse if too much is being done now.
In the last few struggles, Turu has met with opponents whose strength has been conducive.
This time the situation is different.
A Scottish citizen describes as a typical Brazilian.
He is quite aggressive.
I beg that he will come to the first hard ground and try to get away from it.
He has won the World Cup, so he can exert pressure.
The previous contingency did not go as planned.
The Philippines Kev Belingon was seriously turning a blind eye and the Philippines were left with profit.
I have never done so well, especially in my capacity: He was not given a single share.
When I left to break down, he played a role in my eyes.
It was a pity for a very long time.
New motivation
Some of the free boxes are once in the year, others are becoming more densely populated.
For example, in September, a future opponent took up the last time.
Last year, there were three matches.
We are now facing the second battle of this year.
In the meantime, the pace has become pregnant.
Over the past few years, I have been right and well-intentioned.
I have, however, taken the biscuit.
When the 32th year of age heard about future confrontation, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo in Espero and I got back to it.
We had very good premises when there was one cake from Sweden.
It was a great help in training, because Saturday a will have to face up to the physical struggle.
I have received the same size against the same opponents and practising intimidation.
It is therefore 32th year old.
We must make a sense.
If there is an opportunity, I will of course take the tonne myself.
We must not allow our exports to be free of charge, as they consume most.
Macau is attracting a former Taura in China.
It is reported to be the Las Vega of China.
I believe there is a great and great evening before us.
The Federal Reserve will maintain an increase of 0.25%.
The Federal Reserve is expected to announce that it will keep its feet as it has been intransigent in economic growth and that the rise in inflation has brought an end to speculation on interest rates.
The Federal Reserve has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the bank has transferred interest rates because of the increasing pressure on family incomes.
The decision taken by the decision-makers of the Central Bank's monetary policy committee to keep the increase in 0.25%, which received less support this month because of the lack of economic growth.
In its annual inflation sheet, the bank calculated its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecasts for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the income level of households will be under increasing pressure because inflation will continue to increase by around 3% in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, there will be a need for a reduction in the inflation boosted by Brext in the next few years, and the bank announced that the cost of loans could be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
Furthermore, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which was launched a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexite referendum.
The bank will end the Term freezing Sheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected that it will now provide cheap funding for banks with a total of GBP 15 million more, in other words EUR 115 million.
The Minutes of the Bank 's decision on interest rates state that, according to the forecast by the Commission responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years as the real income of households is reduced.
As far as interest rates are concerned, the bank reiterated the need for 'monetary policy to be somewhat more restrictive' than 'market expectations'.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in 2018 in a third quarter of 2018 and in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase is' gradual 'and' limited '.
In May this year, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecasts at 1.8% in 2018.
The dollar and the euro were weakened as a result of the news.
The dollar was reduced by 0.5% and by 1.31 dollars; compared with the euro, it fell by 0.4% and was EUR 1.1.
The decision remains the same after the expected lower rates of growth made more difficult by the expected increase in interest rates, which increased by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects a permanent 0.3% increase in the third quarter, but a little more at the end of the year.
The latest inflation sheet gave little hope of increasing inflation and low-wage increases, and it says that the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy could not prevent the decline in income in the next few years, but it expects a 'significant' recovery at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak balance, which will overturn some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after interest rates fell to 0.25% after the outcome of the EU referendum, which has fallen to the tune of the pound.
The bank considers that the overall impact of the decision will probably begin to be reflected in prices and in the economy only four years' time.
Before the most recent decision by the Central Bank, there had been an ever-increasing demand for interest rates when inflation was printed on the domestic economy, the three decisions were left with an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.6% in June to 2.9%, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the next few months.
According to the bank, the two per cent exceeding the target level was "entirely due to a weak balance.
"In view of the recent fall in interest rates, competition in the housing market would appear to be even more serious when creditors are looking after the clients and want to put an end to the year," says the leader of Coreco Mortgage Brok, Andrew Montlake.
'The market is particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to come to an end, and the new agreements are more popular, their interest is low and there are also expensive alternatives. '
NHS amounts to 10 000 controversial HIV drugs.
From September onwards, patients can be ordered 'HIVs'; the Supreme Court concluded the dispute concerning the financing of a medicinal product in the British public health system (NHS).
NHS has announced that pre-exposure care (PrEP) will be provided for around 10 000 people during the first three years of experiment, and it has been said before I join in saying that there will be a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86% by individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after last year's judgment by the Supreme Court, which says that NHS can pay for the PrEP, even if it is claimed that it should be financed by local authorities.
The leader of the British NHS, Simon Stevensen, called the decision 'significant new intervention' on Thursday, and the National AIDS described it as a 'crucial moment'.
Health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive notification of the experiment that will extend in October to other clinics, which will achieve full coverage in England by April 2018.
First of all, PEP must join in taking HIVs to reduce the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that the PrEP is significantly reducing HIV infection in risk groups.
Before I join with you in saying that there are enough medicinal products in the body which prevent HIV infection.
A medicinal product can take two hours on a daily basis or two hours before the sex.
The target group for treatment includes gay men, biologists and traliberal men and people with HIV positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose to meet the applicants for the experiment to men, women and traliberals, as well as those whose HIV-positive partners do not know to be infected with anti-retroviral treatment.
People living in England and in general medical care can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health cycle.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and NHS in England signed the contract on medicines after international tendering this week.
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeted, taking and carrying out treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the existing multifaceted and increasingly operational means of preventing HIV".
'This is another remarkable achievement in the fight to resolve the most important health challenge facing mankind for more than thirty years. '
'This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV ', saying Debah Gold, the leader of the National AIDS.
"If PEL is properly targeted at those who need it and at risk groups, it may have a counterproductive effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, through the experiment financed by the NHS, a medicinal product that they can decide on independently without any need to negotiate with the partner will have a vigorous effect that will improve the lives of many people.
This was welcome news. "
'The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one is excluded from the risk group ', the leader of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, Ian Gree.
In the experiment, the PrEP medicinal product has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people belonging to risk groups from HIV.
'The beginning of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event which has been unnecessarily prolonged in several months due to the delay in the government ', saying' Mr Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health in the shadow government '.
'We have evidence that a medicinal product can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and to put an end to this threatening disease.
This experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be launched as soon as possible in the country as possible, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and move a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been halted.
The quality of life: The intermediary and fighter solutions have made the life of the small Earl's Court home.
The former banker Jote Leigh, who was enthusiastic about the reorganisation of buildings, changed the lowest housing in Knighsbridge in 2014.
The house of Queen Annan is on the first floor of the anniversary of the anniversary, and the success of the remont tells us that Joo has not yet fled and changed.
'There I and I lived with me in Knightsbridge in a much bigger housing, Joo says.
'I am looking for something similar to my own.
I went to housing here and found that the room was as high as my home.
I arrived immediately and I made a bid on the same day. "
Since then, some 90 square homes have experienced a complete change in form.
It was a two-fold one in which only a pensioner came to the headquarters, and Jone wanted to see more storage and a brochure in order to be able to make use of the card.
'I wanted space, great windows and a lot of light.
They were my demand, "he says.
He paid for the work of the Duck & Shed planning office in Erfa Azoin Notting in High, who was given the task of using almost four metres of the state of high office and of creating a home that is not just a remont and selling destination but a home.
The euphemism was not enough to double the situation, so the challenge was to build an intermediary layer in which the taste was standing.
The solution called for a creative thinking on the part of Erfa.
'Territories are quite complex.
The holdings had to be organised in such a way that they do not need a maturity.
The structures had to be designed in such a way that the card is just the right thing to do on their own side and under them. "
Erfa was able to deploy two high rooms with fascinating privatisations.
In the Mediterranean, a few Christian windows of Reterous are opened up to a state of residence of a girl.
Beauty furniture fish, heat-efficiency and Serge Mulle video create a characteristic style.
The use of Peilvos brings theatre, emotion and light.
The boys on both sides of the short corridors will get the corridors to look longer.
The cat in the middle of the cabinet is like a window that is opening up the prospect of another room.
There is a state of detention for the Joan anials and shellfish in stupid fish.
The fact that the creditor is not allowed to be hidden when it is not used makes it more sense.
Pilots fitted on Tittocs are not a new solution;
But in the Joann cheque it is unique that the door should be raised in the same way as the car door.
"It called for a little planning", "The Erfa tells us of the steelth of the MDFF.
"It is balanced, in other words, when it comes to raising its seat very easily."
With the rational use and planning of the storage state, Joo received 16 extra nets, a second poor and better basic solution.
'The surface sector will decide - or the value of buildings', the words of Erfa.
In the Permanent case, the property intermediary is throwing his house in order and falling on the basis of the surface sector.
The surface area was increased by the use of high-quality materials which produce luxury.
The 'citizen is in contact with the materials in the housing, and the emotion of the house is partly based on them, "The Erfa says.
'nobody is interested in electrical management in the cement.
They too are important but not in the same way. "
The Joan housing is an example of the fact that good planning and additional elephants can make basic housing extremely wonderful.
It may then also be that there is no desire to change the population.
A pregnant priest, Sofia, weather in his summer holidays.
In the Princient Sofia, the choice of the inhabitants of Sofia was a napet.
In Prince Sofia represented the Swedish Bendstad for the last time before birth.
The Saturday Tomorrow event had opted for a fun meteorous.
Sofia represented a smile.
In the Swedish province of Sofia, a visit has been made to Sweden this week in Beach stad.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented by A seminar in a wonderful blueprint of Stufia Tomorrow, which was splendid in the last penny of pregnant prize.
Sofia came to take place in a eligible population.
It is the last time that Sofia represents before birth.
His calculated time is in September.
The dinner Sofi had opted for a beautiful photol, which was dressed in splendid terms.
The supreme cheque was a great deal of compensation and an insurmountable small layer.
The Passtel puppet was splendid in the prize.
Sofia has been in Bendstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia supplemented his lives on a small plate.
Sofi was in a lovely summer holiday.
Mr Sofia even went to the photographs.
Now I am just hiding my hand, Sofia said 'laughter' and made reference to his rest pregnancy.
He adds us to a blind chicken.
In the summer of 1996, a dog was sent to the Gulf towers to sell Taiman food.
The Ladhine people did not dare to taste, but went over.
In Kok, food was sold in Panya Suamria-Pentil, between known people and Panja.
He was not able to afford much, and the people of Finland did not yet have a penny.
Because they did not dare to eat, Panja offered free mafias.
In this way he taught the Sahrawi people to eat foods, spring-to-spring.
From countries, he said.
I left a little of a teeth.
I visited more and more times, ultimately every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his cake in the Gulf.
There were two small tables, fewer than 20 clients.
He taught us not only to eat foods, but also to sit next to his boat.
When there is hunger and a limited number of places, it cannot be left out of support between themselves and between them.
We looked at the little bit better and we became blood.
At the end of the day, I was sitting around the pocket with the words' to learn '.
Two years went on to the merchandise, but then the restaurant had to change because the rubber-staffed rubbish itself would appear to be too much in control.
A new place was released at the end of the march.
There is room there.
Now we drinks are again sitting in our own desks, only in the most congested times we are forced to ask the visitors whether there is a state.
Mr Panja knows his client.
He is told where there has been and who has been seen.
He knows what food they eat.
He has seen how the customer's lifestyle varies and the food club changes.
He will remember what a man I went to eat my first spring converter.
He reminds me of what I was young.
It is painful to go to lunch a little later than others, to sit on my own doorstep at the door of the pensioner's door and exchange their belonging to the Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught us a milestone of tolerance and internationalism.
He has also opened up our ideas and our hearts.
Today, many people are talking to him - thank you for the increased comfort of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has been difficult, he is always friendly.
He is hard.
He is on the brink of his work in that way and in black.
Last week, a restaurant celebrated two decades.
We customers got a diamond coffee.
Without alarm or attention, this is an important day in which the work has been carried out.
The discovery of a secular subsidy line was rewarded by 173 Isishers who were prepared to attack in Europe.
The security authorities received an important list from the beginning of the year for the work against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 data from an Isishop fighter who is prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data, but also the images of everyone.
More than 130 of the people listed on the list are Iraqi, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Istant reported on the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now, the site of the list and the information contained in it have become more precise.
According to the press, the special Iraqi army found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when they looked at the land of the terrorist organisation in Moist.
The American intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of paper and sent them to INTERREG.
The list was distributed from INTERREG to all the security authorities in the European countries in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists in the near East.
According to die Welt, the list has not only the names and images of all people, but also the age of birth, the inventions and information on the country of origin of the individual.
The list also specifies the specific areas of terrorism.
For example, the German 27th year old on the list, Sami J. It reads the battles of Abu Assid-Almani, the German.
He is told he had gone from Germany in 2012 to Egypt, then Libya, and then via Turkey to Syria to join the waters of Isin.
A special suicide bombers have been written outside his description.
There is no more precise information on the fate of the man.
Europe has left around 6 000 combatants in Isri, whose fate is uncertain.
A man fell below the top in Tokovina in Helsinki.
In the light of the interview between the rescue facility, he wanted to show that he was going to sleep.
The vote can also save the lives of the rumour.
On Thursday, a person who was under water was saved in Tokoinland in Helsinki.
According to Mr Estlander, the fire fighter who is going to be killed by the Helsinki rescue facility, the situation was over quickly.
A person was found in water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The winner of the rescue facility found him at the top, Estlander says.
Half a four-yearly announcement was made by the Pelascular Office.
The person was given first treatment.
Estlander tells us that it was about 50 years old.
In the light of the statements he wanted to make, he wanted to show that he was going to sleep.
The situation in the Danube is already over.
Estlander talks about cooperation between the authorities with the border guards and the police.
It was a task for the border guards.
The wolf also learnt marshes very well.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was saved from water together with the border guards and the police.
Two passenger cars came up in Eura - nine people in cars, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in cars, the remaining ones with fewer injuries, who are the daily fighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident took place at three pages at four days a day.
Kolari happened when one car came to a warning triangle to the other car, tells us the day-to-day fighter.
According to the rescue facility, there is a speed limit of 80 km.
Brothers are fighting over USD 500 million for property property.
Two brothers are arguing about the biggest property empire in Victoria, which is worth more than USD 500 million, and this is linked to their Italian family enterprise, forty years ago.
The President of the former Carlton football club and the property developer, Colin De Lusis, live in Tora only three houses from his younger brother, Paul, and the younger debt has taken to the Supreme Court the dispute about the distribution of property and business property between brothers.
Mr Paul has wanted to leave the family company as early as 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
Brothers and their mother Anna jointly owned 38 buildings worth more than USD half a billion, and the family began to accumulate property when they purchased the trade in Cliningwoodland Street in 1973.
The family established Westco Jeans there, which I extended to the 160 movement chain.
The trade chain was sold at USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on buildings and today the family owns offices, building areas in Brundswi and Sorrento and housing in Gold Coasti and Mt Bullia, and shopping centres in estuary areas.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Mr Colin owns about two thirds and Mr Paul is about a third of the company's wealth, which describes his father as' family power and centralist '.
According to the law, the allocation of property means that Columbia owns buildings worth around USD 316 million and Paul worth around USD 176 million.
Mr Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of buildings and funds.
'I think that, in his proposal, Mr Colin left the best buildings for himself ', Paul wrote in his first lie testimony to the right in 2015.
This case was first dealt with by the Supreme Court last Friday after several conciliation companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who dominates existing business and Paul claims that Columbia has excluded him from business.
Mr Colin says that this is not the case; he accuses Paul of the poor management of certain buildings.
Mr Colin wrote one of his first enlightening testimonies that he wanted a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions," the family is the most important to me. "
There are hundreds of pages of statements, e-mails and reports, which are being examined by consular companies such as Delots, Piancher Partner and Charter Keck Crala, as well as best and most experienced lawyers such as Allan Myers.
The married husband, Luigi, was an Italian immigrant who created milk bars and nerve shops at the end of the 1950s and who, at the beginning of the 70s, bought Brunswich.
They were used as an insurance in the purchase of a family from Clingwoodland to the first fabric of the family created by Columbia.
Columbia tells us that it has created trade in the last few years, when Paul was still a child (around 10 years old).
Mr De Lusto tells us that he and Mrs Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer buildings to their boys in a spirit of harmony.
'Luigi often said that it is not the brothers who want to end up in court ', Anna wrote in his statement.
The two other boys of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lusais group, Colin said that Mark received USD 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are 'bitter from their point of view of economic conditions'.
Colin has had a low profile, although it is a former member of the government of the Australian football club and a television star Eddie McGuir's best friend to this life which appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Columbia and Paul De Lut and their lawyers on Friday.
He said in his text that it is not really possible to comment because it is before the courts.
'It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take me to court and, according to our family name, to take me to court, he wrote '.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the courts that he had tried to meet his brothers' demands.
"Our father would not have liked us to be controversial in this way", Mr Colin continued to say that he still hopes that a solution will be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have fallen.
"Our business will be brought to justice in the near future", as Mr Colin wrote.
The new Director-General of the Trentin is going to restrict the media use of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First of all.
According to Poltico, the new director of staff in the White House is going to restrict the use of President Trentin and the monitoring of news so that the bombing does not so often get into difficulties.
Journalist Joh Dawsey reports:
"When the new Director-General of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with management staff at the first working day, he raised the fundamental problem he intends to resolve: He intends to restrict President Donald Trentin's access to information.
Mr Kelly told the workers in the White House that all information - both printed and informed - must go through him because the President takes better decisions when he is informed. "
Mr Kell's words make sense, but others too have tried to limit the use of the Trentin media and have failed.
President Trentin has a relationship with television for decades - and he still sees a great deal of television as President.
'If the presidential candidate, Mr Trump, was nervous about unfair disclosure, he was in favour of showing that the pro-active media dealt with matters in a more balanced manner ', Sam Nunberg, who, as adviser, was involved in the campaign in Trentin, reported to the Poltico in February.
The journalist Tara Palace wrote at the time that, according to the six former campaigners, it is essential for his personal media office to be part of an equal sentence of praise.
That is clear.
It is ridiculous, however, to say that the use of Twiters would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that we others do not know - perhaps the Trimer Wars would have been even worse without their efforts.
We will probably never be able to know what messages were left from Mr Trentin.
If his staff have been able, at least for a few times, to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trum from causing.
The problem lies partly in the fact that there are competing groups in the White House which are trying to push their case by providing more information which supports their view, which may be reliable - or not.
In May, Poltico wrote that advisers were deliberately giving the President questionable information.
A journalist, Mr Goldmacher, reported on a case:
'The current and former workers of the Danube say that they can be humiliated enormously from the press operations in which they are criticised - especially if they report harmful leaks of information - then they are absolutely forced to know where they come from.
This was the case at the end of February when someone gave the President a copy of the net provocation, Charles C. Johnson's news of the Good News.com site, which was set up by Dr Johnson, accused of a number of information leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed because of the harassment in Twiant and had previously disseminated false allegations and subsequently cancelled them, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Mr Trump had begun to drink his staff from Walshia. "
Goldmacher added that the then Director-General, Reence Pribune, and Secretary of State Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a system for the management of documents to Mr Trentin '.
And what was the outcome?
Mr Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove more effective than Mr Pribune, but Mr Trump still has his own nerve self-interest and his assistants continue to pursue his own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Cell a very difficult task.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with the PSGs.
Brazil's star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the PSGs, an AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was said that the representatives of Neymar had paid football for the FC in the Spanish league at Barcelona of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar Agreement with Barcelona was therefore dropped and he was free to move a couple of relatives to the PSGs.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest transfer in football history.
Earlier on, the record was in Manchester Union, which paid EUR 105 million in French Paul Pog last summer.
The PSGs owned a government-owned company, Qatar Sporto Initiative.
As President of the club, a former theatre, the Khmer Roulafi, is in office.
Neymarin is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The Movement writer Raija Oranen explained alcohol and air fear with a hotspot: 'I am in a state of my life'.
Mr Raija Orann has just taken his 69th anniversary.
He helped Raija Ora.
Five children hold mumbles in such a way as to write that Raii and his husband, Jyrkrai, abandoned the sunshine of Spain and the Fuengerol population after 18 winters.
First, they sold their house, but now they went to a temporary housing in the spring.
The habit of light and sun, of ancient byrinth, Raijan's attitude and alcoholism, which he has explained.
The external dimension is 20 kilograms lighter.
The emphasis came to fall when Serbian drugs were abolished, they were solar medicinal products.
At the time, I received aid from the pockets, which was also a source of air fear, and I was able to do so.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the weather writer says openly.
Ria and Jyroi Oranen have travelled over 45 years.
I can better than ever.
For more than 40 years now, Jyror Oranen, who worked together in the area of Ria and tourism.
I experienced, and it was married in two weeks, Raias.
The Queen of such a drama has always been, he has stopped his life from that, Jyroki naïve.
Mr Oranen, the great writer 's career, is only reminded of the very good 44th, clean whoever was shut up in the tamperor of Finland.
I decided once and for all that the clothing industry was in the hands of the family, when I read a 50th anniversary interview in Liese Seppänen.
I myself was a daughter, my mother also had a clothing movement and I was sometimes a statesman, Orann's memory.
A series of drinks and stories changed the Finnish attitude to entrepreneurship.
Anta Savev's study and the claim that it was rewarded, Orann says.
Ria Orann lives in an active period of time, he has many manual work - hundreds of ideas.
The Kierides went back over the boat of 'militia extremism'.

They were driven out of the region in May, but they succeeded in overcoming their desirability, with children, horses and the army of package cars.
The Iberian people succeeded in overcoming the passage in a non-protective paragraph.
The people who have been harassed have been accused of the Soliahill administration 's total inability to resolve the problem'.
The anonymous Permanent, on Monday evening, tells us that Bentley Heartht had taken the lead in the stones.
'The municipality must be harnessed because it appears to be completely incapable of resolving the problem.
The Iberian people were here in May, then they left but they returned again.
They became more and probably more today. "
The inhabitant told us that Birmingham's municipality had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
'I live in Streetbrok Roady and it is frustrating to pay local tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it '.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous for rogue people to return as soon as they were driven out.
"They are more and more, and they have even fallen into the park of horses."
According to the information of the Solihus municipality, the municipality is aware of the illegal breakdown in the near Streetrok Roard: 'We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Soliah police to disappear the camps as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many local as possible make the police aware of disturbing or criminal acts.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
The people who were harassed were attacked by Portuguese tourists.
In Portugal, men of forced landing have been consulted in court today.

Yesterday, the small plane flying by men was forced to fall into the shores of So Joao da Caparice, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beaches at the time of the event, some of whom are forced into water.
The machine fell into the 56th-year-old man and the 8th-year-old girls who died immediately.
The machine first came to the man who was a Scottish body.
Immediately afterwards, the machine came up and, when it came down again, it came to the end of the child, it told the newspaper Fianpe Janeirira Joeiro in Jonnal de Notic.
The little girl killed was on the beaches with its parents.
Parents were not injured.
On the beaches, the small plane was surrounded immediately by anger.
The father and other people went to the container and started to bury it, reported the case in the Celia Rocha Cocha da Manha newspaper.
He called a criminal flight, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men in the machine were not injured by forced fall.
The Finnish starter, who has tragically lost his daughter, once again won Mafia: 'Without an accident, it would be the world champion'.
At the early Wednesday morning, Matti Surri Hammar celebrated Finland's time in Mavement in the Canadian Big Whitet.
Earlier in the cats, Scrown Hammar also won the Crossin Muck.
Three Ms have already been collected.
Quite incredible Moulean!
Two times the journey was carried out, the time is ripe, the Speaker Hammari, the telephone, was delighted.
A 30-year-old cargo thanked his constituent and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Supat, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole merger has grown and has developed a great deal recently.
Differences will be reduced and there will be many new cargoes involved.
One always wonders whether someone will be a black horse.
There seems to be a different winner in every cat.
Another train lost in the motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiastically from young to her friends, and the accident did not want to get bogged down.
You will remember from time to time what my life would be without it.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in taking a stand.
They play a role in what has been distributed, Suphrand Hammar underlines.
It would be cruel to break a serious accident and the loss of a lorry as a beacon, and neither is it done.
But he has turned a gross difficulty into a good thing.
I would say that the situation has turned into a victory.
I would not be a three-fold world champion without accident.
In the run-up to the accident, the biggest pioneer in the Great Hamar, who was 233rd, was already sleeping.
It was only after the accident that my new generation started to get off the ground.
As a young friend of blood, I was in Trenas, and we always enjoyed our enthusiasm for XXth-Gams.
But they were far-off dreams, which went some way over time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere in the Xu-Gams story.
I would not have imagined beforehand.
I was 230th year old and I wonder that this will be a long life if I leave here to bitter and regret.
I decided to pull the riots and start work.
I would say that I have been quite successful.
For the sake of the choice of Leco-Pecka as a sportsman of the year, the Laskier was delighted.
A four-fold Olympic winner received his salary in the sports sector in January.

In a year 's time, there will be paralympia in South Korea.
They start to seek a miracle!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will be able to return permanently to their country of origin unless the war ends and the source of Iswis.
A study on the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon was explained.
Syrian refugees are fleeing in the refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isi from the country are the most important things that should happen to enable them to return to their homeland.
The Trentin regime does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The Estonian office chain Burson-Marset out the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marset has already examined the opinions and attitudes of Arab young people in nine years.
This year the A Voice for Youong Sangan Refugees study explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In March 2017, 400 Syrian young people aged 1824 were responsible for research, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
Research shows that more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not think they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% of the respondents could think of going back to their homeland and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision on the return of young people will be the most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isi in the country.
Almost half (47%) considers the end of the war to be the most impressive factor in the permanent return of the country, while the fourth is the departure of Isi.
Only less than 10% will make the decision the most important factors for improving the economic situation or for leaving Bashar Assad in Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
The question was raised to the Syrian young people: What is the most important factor in ending the conflict?
The majority believes that the end of war is more important than the renationalisation of President Bashar Assad.
A fair fourth of the Presidents of Assad is a barrier to the peace agreement.
Almost half of the experience is that, in order to put an end to the current Syrian conflict, we need political and military solutions.
Only military action to resolve the conflict has faith in just one quarter.
The majority of Asyrian Refugees see the weakening of the Isi regime in the last year, while the fifth feels that its power has been strengthened.
According to their counterparts, the most important thing in the fight against Isi and, in general, against terrorism is that the media should inform people that Is have nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people gave priority to military measures and to educational reform.
More than ten people think that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When it comes to the effects of the Taliban regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of the leaders believe that the conflict will not change under the Trentin regime.
Almost every quarter believes that the Syrian conflict is worsening during the Trimi era.
Opinions are divided as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Mont Wideus will spend half of his time at home in order to keep the net in order - for example, the database he has developed and Google.
The Espoo company, Maria DB, is developing a 'world's fastest growing' open source code.
The main product of Maria Widge, created by Commons Michael, is not paid to users at all and can be developed through NETT by anyone who has a praiseworthy programme.
For example, Google and Wikipez are users of a Finnish database, but they are not necessarily the customers who pay.
The databases will allow huge numbers of information to remain in order and quickly available.
If you use, for example, Linke, Twitters or Bokong, they will take advantage of the Maria DB or MySQuL database.
"All information, which is not described, comes from the database and they have been linked to it" explains Wideus.
Mr Wideus, the technological director of the Maria DB, will spend around half of his time at home.
The man who carries out the distance-working in Kunia will contribute to ensuring that the Internet works smoothly.
Widnius developed the database of the most popular open source in the world, together with the Swedish David Axmar.
In 2008, the technology company Sun was at the hands of USD 1 billion of MySQuL, and a year later software left Oracle harvest at 7.4 billion in Sun.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQuL developers declared themselves to be leaving.
"They did not want to work on Oracle, which did not give a firm promise of the future of MySQuL", Wideus will recall.
He had already set up a company which began to develop Maria DB.
He did not want his life to die.
Two or ten of the best pieces of development from Sunday to Sunday and I ensured that the continuity of the code will be safeguarded with the same catalysts that created it.
As MySQuL is a database of open source, Maria DB was able to develop its own house.
The name had to be changed.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the development of the Maria DB code.
'During My SQuL, these assurances were not made', and Wideus regrets.
Although many people have heard about Wide and MySQuL's billions of trade, few Finnish people know anything about Maria DB.
'In the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year ', the economic leader of the Maria DB, Kenneth Paq.
Maria DB, which is focused on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Pakistani is so naïve as to be the hallmarks of a company.
He reveals that, during the current financial year, Maria DB will be able to receive an opportunity of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are prepared to pay.
Maria DB will also help to exchange databases, which may be a career of more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
The exchange of MySQuL from Maria DB will succeed at once because they are different versions.
For example, the Spanish operator, Telefónica, and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DS, are paying Maria DB.
The most popular cloud services, such as AWS, Microsoft Azur, Albba Cloud, offer their clients Maria DB.
At the same time, Maria DB automatically spreads to new users in the distribution packages for Linux, where Maria DB has largely replaced MySQuL.
Although we are a small fence, we have links with the major players.
'The main telecommunications operators in the world, the games, banks and even the single central bank 'are among them.
The IT market still exists with closed databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
Oracle MySQuL is a modest by-site in comparison with the traditional closed database of the company.
Despite the fact that, according to Mr Gartsen, the largest databases have lost their share of the market in recent years, the games such as Maria DB are still insignificant, albeit rapidly increasing.
The database of around USD 50 billion on the market, the databases of an open source do not even reach one billion.
The weight of the open source code cannot, however, be measured only in money, because most users do not pay anything for these software.
Mr Garter predicts that by 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on the basis of open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged to open doors or at least a transfer would have been begun.
Large companies will not be given new customers because the majority will now choose an open source code.
This has resulted in the licence fees for commercial databases being dropped.
Companies want to do as much money as they did in the past with a smaller customer, Wideus.
Since the exchange of closed databases is difficult, the majority of client companies have been cumbersome in terms of price increases.
'There are a lot of customers who are really difficult to move because their old applications and others are caught up in a closed database ', Wideus says.
He believes, however, that the number of customers is going to be full.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later move into an open source code database.
The price is between 10% and 20% of the previous, and the service is better, because the customer can easily exchange information if he so wishes.
Moreover, many companies are faced with major changes to the system when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change the database.
Last spring, Maria DB received EUR 25 million of loans from the EIB.
It was never the largest contribution to growth in the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now to be recruited more.
One of the reasons for financing the EIB was the impact of Maria DB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros every year from databases.
"Many countries want to move towards solutions to the open source code and thus spend tax money more efficiently", as Mr Pakistani says.
It is unfortunate that in Finland money is being wasted, for example, on closed health systems, when open systems are cheaper and large-scale is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some people say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it is a better way of making the code.
The Community is helping and doing something that is not self-help or capable of doing.
The 55th-year-old Wideus is one of the most widely known promoters of the open source code, together with the other Finnish, Linus Tranvald.
Widnius will help other companies to develop workable business models on the back of the open source code.
I still have 445 speeches every year on this subject throughout the world.
Italy is stepping up its attitude to civil protection vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations which will save refugees from their vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue to operate unless they commit themselves to the new rules governing their activities.
'If the NGOs do not commit themselves to a new policy guideline, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate ', the Minister for the Interior, Marco Minnia, said in an interview with the' The La Stmpa 'newspaper.
Mr Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a German Jugent Rete vessel, whose crews were suspected of working together to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organisation which has been operating for just a year refused to comment on the detailed charges of Ambrigio Cartagena.
We very much regret the fact that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area, the organisation announced in its statement in the social media.
'We can only judge the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and we can assess the situation '.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring since the Iuvise of Jugend Rett since October.
The crew is suspected that the boat has gradually taken refugees directly from human traffickers who have re-introduced their boats.
One such incident is alleged to have taken place only a few kilometres away from Libya's coast, which is reflected in a public prosecutor's document, whose content has been published by the Italian media.
The crews are suspected of threatening the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue measures in the region, which is regarded as the motive for aid.
According to the operational guidelines, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police force which monitors the activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to follow the line of action: Pelapua Lapland and the Maltese MOA and the Spanish Professor Professor Acetta Opeta Arms;
Anyone who announced on Thursday that it considers the new rules to be redundant but acceptable because they do not create 'significant changes or obstacles to the protection of the organisation'.
Among those who refused to follow the line of action are the Nobelel-earned Médecins sans Frontières.
Mr Minti said that the rescue measures have led to a sharp decline in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, as he sees it as a sign of efforts to strengthen Libya's coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"Recent days have seen light at the end of the tunnel", the Minister said.
He pointed out that the plans will have to continue discussions with Libya's mayors this month on projects for economic development and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The Far East worker is suspected of murdering his unmarried partner in Enontel, the suspects were found in the warehouse - a public prosecutor.
The suspected crime took place in Enonte Kutta last December.
According to the police, the 36th-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26th-year-old Scottish unmarried partner.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspects had fled with two dogs.
The man was found in a cold warehouse and he did not protest.
The blame must be raised within less than a week.
The case may be dealt with by Lapland's supreme court in the course of August.
Robert Harry Pottert, known as my hotter and all sorts of friends, has died.
The British samples Robert Hardy have died at 91th.
On Thursday, this family was informed of the death of the actor.
The Hardy, who was born in 1925, began his sample in the theatre at 244th age.
During his long life he also showed in August and television.
Mr Hardy is particularly mindful of the role played by the magic minister, Mr Carrvarius Toff in Harry Pottertert in August, as well as the role of veterinary surgeons in the television of my hesitant friends, James Herrio.
The recommended set of BBC was described by seven years.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for the messages of incitement to suicide.
The Massachusetti woman has been sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for textual messages and telephone calls, which were seen as an incitement to the suicide of his son, Conrad Roye.
Michelle Carter, 20 months of his sentence in prison and five years in a candidate.
Carter was sentenced to death in June and his son, Conrad Roy, committed suicide at 1.7.2014.
My 'family has broken', as Mr Conrad said during the sitting on Thursday.
'my son was my best friend '.
Mr Carter sought a change to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Mr Carter and Mr Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, who dressed on the Red Louge and the clumsy puppet, listened to his sentence in the face of a crude bracket created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roye", the prosecutor said that he was entitled.
'he decided on the life of Mr Conrad in order to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, the prosecutor went on.
'she has not shown a horror '.
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was' caused by 'shocking conditions, which Mr Carter cake is deeply familiar with'.
However, the judge, Lawrence Moniz, did not think that the Carter 's' age or maternity level and even the health problems had any significant impact on his actions'.
The public prosecutor read the statement by the mother of Conrad, Mr Lynn Royy, that 'no day goes by without killing the death of my loved son.
I want him to be proud of all this and I will do my best to persuade her sister in this pain, which we will always take up.
Mr Conrad's sister Camdy Roy rightly said that he was persecuted by the idea that he never comes to see his brothers' distress and not to be his children.
'It is painful to lose someone who has been in my life since I was born every day, and the pain is never heated ', as Mr Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the State of Massachusetti that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 1714 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014.
The case attracted the attention of the authorities when it emerged that Carter, in his texts, had encouraged his son to commit suicide.
'Hirta, a smile shelter, a tree for himself, I do not know, there are many ways, 'I do not know, Carter wrote in many of the stones he had sent to Roye during the two weeks preceding this death, when he was on holiday with his family.
Just a few moments before the Roye suicide, Carter wrote: 'You must do it, Conrad' and 'Sinn must only launch a glimmer of energy, and you are free and happy'.
The judge, Mr Moniz, said that Carter was sensitive to the death of Roye, which stipulated that Carter should not benefit by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of the experts.
Few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who were sentenced to murder his British fellow MEP in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the Knox opinion paper: 'Michelle Carter needs sympathy and assistance, not prison'.
Secretary-General of NATO: The worst in Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably, commenting on the Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that the relationship between NATO and Russia is now more difficult than it has ever since the end of the Cold War, and Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we had hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Krim in 2014 and Russia's continuing instability in the region of Austria, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we can predict, we can enter into a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a deterioration in the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, found itself in a dangerous situation between the United States and Russia.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the poor conglomerates of the countries, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audo will change because of the setback suffered by car manufacturers.
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update software of more than 350 000 cars.
The leader of BMWL said that he believed that 'there would be more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions'; he referred to European cities such as the BMWL town, Munich, which is considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Dimler announced that he would make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a 'setback'.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to achieve the objectives of carbon dioxide emissions.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and asthma.
The cost of the installation of polluting equipment will rise and it will be difficult to price cars in a competitive manner.
German car manufacturers are under strict scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merrik has been accused of complicating and ignoring the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Mr Volkswagen 's mistakes, and Mr Volkswagen extracted machines for reducing emissions in accordance with the rules, which were higher in normal times.
Several leaders of Volkswagen have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of leaders are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the director of the Audi motorway Development Directorate was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovani Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was included in the criminal investigation of Volkswagen, where the authorities doubted that Audi had installed a system to circumvent European emission requirements, based on similar research in the United States.
The Audi study could significantly weaken the position of Volkswagen: The car manufacturer 's share of Volkswagen' s profits is disproportionate.
The Venezuela vote began with a lively investigation, with large demonstrations in the pipeline.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a firl who has no role to play in the outcome of the elections, the chairman of the National Election Company, Tianbisa Lucas, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end.
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, the representative was elected to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against changing it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are under way at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces in the country began on Wednesday evening at local level to take over the country's parliament building.
The force is to ensure the safety of the appointment opportunity.
Climate change threatens Provence.
The boat has become the symbol of the Provence region in France, but it is now threatening climate change.
In the light of the drought and the suffering of the disease, the scientists and farmers were trying to find a solution to the problem in a hurry.
'Liver is in direct danger in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which have led to a marked reduction in the rainfall in the spring and, in particular, in the autumn ', saying that the CREPAM research expert in Provenco, EREPAMM, specialised in agriculture, has fallen considerably.
"This reduces the life expectancy of a ladder.
Furthermore, the drought has brought with it a large number of small clothes that spread microbacteria. "
The stakes are hard.
Petroleum oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly wanted component of volatile water and cosmetics.
Instead of long flowers and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers, which are poorly developed or weakened, and which are completely lacking.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing oil."
The solution will be achieved by stepping up irrigation, by delaying the loss of soil revenge and by mixing Mr Save and water with the protection of plants, and by developing more sustainable varieties of drought.
The murder of the journalist reflects an increasing threat in Mexico.
The latest cases of organised crime, the corrupt authorities and the endless war on drugs in the State of Sinaria usually meet on Wednesday.
Today, however, we are debating security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routine.
Two experienced journalists are talking about which is safer: To leave children home or to include them in the editorial attack in 2009.
The safety experts have written three words to the list of annexes in the poor advantage: Opponents, neutral allies.
They are asking journalists to appoint a name to each group; evidence is not needed, there is a need for discovery and knowledge.
The list will include the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of having a government or drug cartels on pay lists, who are criminals who, from the chaos of Mexico, make the life of distillation into life.
Violence is incalculable and increasingly targets are journalists; according to the Supervisory Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nietto took office in December 2012, where 589 journalists have been subjected to attacks and threats, at least seven journalists have been murdered this year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Carden, the founder of Riodoc, the journalist and the source of innovation.
'The greatest error is to live in Mexico and be a journalist ', Mr Valdez wrote in one of many of his reports on drug violence.
He is in deep need of him, even though he is present everywhere, and the publication of the Riodoc building conceals an enormous picture of the 'Law', in which Mr Valdez appears to be turning a blind eye.
Less than two months after the death of Mr Valdez, journalists are talking about their common trauma, nightmare, their vanity and their fears of persecution.
In 2010, a federal public prosecutor was created, especially for the treatment of journalists, but, according to the journalists' protection committee, only two prosecutions have been committed so far.
The murderers rarely get to justice, as are the thousands of drug trafficking and the murders of organised crime every year.
Journalists in Rio will continue to write to Sinara on the violence, even if they are murdered by sadness and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra says that the security meeting is of little use, because the killers are not aware of and are not hoping for justice.
'This meeting is frankly wasting time ', he says.
'We cannot trust anyone as long as we do not know the reasons for this. '
Mr Valdez had left the supply of Rio in the capital of the State in Culic this morning from 3.5.17 to 2017.
He had only taken a couple of cards, when two men stopped him and forced him out of their car and shot twelve ferries, presumably in the name of the newspaper: Rio means two hundred rivers.
The shock was driven away by the car of Valdez and triggered it at some end of the journey.
Mr Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a father and two adults.
Rumours move quickly and are free to live in Culia.
The death of Mr Valdez is, however, in a hurry.
Sinala has been one of the most bloody fights in Mexico since Mr Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill a vacuum.
The streets of Sinasa are shot on a daily basis by somebody or a number of people, and the cemetery has substituted two-tier funeral buildings for drugs havens which are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, there is' calm 'when only one cartel dominates ports and routes to drug trafficking in the United States.
Although Mr Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and Director of Riodoc, Imail Borique, feels guilty of being unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Mr Valdez.
In February, Riodo published the interview between Damso Ladze, leading a competing bloc against the Guzmann boys.
Mr Guzmann's boys could be angry: The clients who were suspected of being members of the train bought every number in the press as soon as the newspaper came to the sales points.
The second error was that Mr Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another journalist was attacked.
Mr Valdez was a legendary in Mexico and abroad and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had explained so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had done a long job in Noroeste when, in 2003, he decided to set up five colleagues in Riodoc, with 50 dollars in the press.
It was impossible to do journalism in Sinhala without addressing the problem of drugs, as Borique says.
Over time, the press began to feel bold and honest about its bold drinks and its sale and advertising income increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing a hard-class journalism without fear of censorship, including in the press, which no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoy won the prestige of Maria Mors Cabot in Latin America.
In the same year, Mr Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of the Press from his courage to follow the Mexican drug trafficking story with intransigence.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life", "he said that he was the winner of the journalists' Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a 'way of life' in Sinasa, as Mr Valdez said in his interview with the TV in October last year.
The journalist must take on the role he is given - or show stupid.
I do not want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was here to die - why did I not say what was going on?
The staff of Rio need Mr Valdez - a fantasy who stolen like a dock worker - and they need a friend who was always given the floor and advice; they need a teacher who knows how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always used a packet.
He went to El Guyayatano, which was opposed to the supply, and was always sitting on the same table.
They are now asking whether routine was the result of his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best they can do their job and remain alive.
"Criminals will not see it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business activities, their secret thanks to drug trafficking.
They were excluded ', as Mr Bokriquiz says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection;
You have confidence in your own handicaps.
If it feels that everything is not right, then we must remain absent.
According to the journalist, Andres Villralal, the problem is that 'the impression can be deceived, and this happened in the case of Jville'.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaria, nor do they apply to de Talamauma, Veracruz, Guerra and other states with dangerous networks: Attractive smugglers, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operational environment is constantly changing.
Mobile telephones could not be brought into the room where the Riodoc security training was held, and it had become clear in the past that only spying programmes sold to governments had been accompanied by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought protection against 40 degrees of heights.
They had been ordered by the government of the Länder to monitor the premises of Riodoc, which are located in a four-tier building in the central Culic region.
Some journalists were half-hearted as to whether it was these two police officers who belong to the 50% that the Governor of the State did not consider reliable.
It has been months since journalists had visited mountainous rural areas controlled by drug gangs.
This week, the delivery of Riodoc provided three main chains.
The debt of Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinara.
It was also intended to reveal that government spending had focused on the town of Governor.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culia, the only thing I did at the end of the public prosecutor's office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who was abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: Everyone in the town knew that the food was in the hands of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolution (Pri), who has dominated Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors who belong to it have recently been accused of corruption in cases which may be of much publicity.
Villrals asked the journalist to write on previous cases in the same place, one of them, 'El Chapo' Guzmann's boy managed to flee and avoid a military raid.
A few months before, lecturers would have known that they would have received reliable information on the kidnapping of Mr Valdez's beer.
'In the past we would have known what had happened ', the 46th-year-old Villral, who has been given the title' El Flaco 'as a result of his diet, Ohumble.
"Now all contacts with our sources of information are a boy."
Mr Valdez's machine has been converted into a reserve to maintain sows and stories against the persecution of journalists, who have acquired a new, unexpected task: They have become activists for press freedom.
The journalist Mirim Ramirez took on board a few villages when he went to the local public prosecutor next morning to protest against the further murder of a journalist.
Three days after the murder of Valdez, Salvador Adam disappeared in the Western State of Michoc.
After the disappearance, a corpse was found which, on the basis of the DNAA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adam.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, and SOS Preses texts appear in demonstrations and buildings.
Today, Mr Borique is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for Mr Valdez's case.
The day after the murder of Valdez, Mr Ramirez, met the Governor of Sinara and accused the journalists of spying and killing because they tell the truth.
He has then asked for him to be taken away from drinks dealing with the government because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective.
Mr Valdez has repeatedly said that organised crime around journalists in Mexico, allows the authorities and indifferent society.
In its last letter, Narkomnialism Valdez writes that drugs gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Arctic 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
In Mexico, people are being beaten by killing, Ramirez says.
The murders have a paralysing effect.
No one forgets the death of Bologna Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border state of Taiuuuuuma six years ago.
His body was signed by Zetatsky: "I am here because of my book."
Next to his dismissal, there was the photograph of computers and bulldozens.
Some of the newspapers have decided to put an end to their activities, as in the case of El Norte 's newspaper in the northern border state of Chemo, following the painful murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some will continue to work, as Nuvo Laredo El Mana did, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published the message to drug cartels: 'What do you want of us?'
Some journalists have fled from their federal states or from the country as a whole.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and we must keep quiet all the time.
Sometimes criminals were looking for a journalist's hands, as was apparently the photograph for Rubbean Especific, who was murdered with four women in Mexico City in 2015, three months after he had fled from Verbruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibara - which was supposed to become a poet at the time - admits that drug trafficking is a source of fear.
"I came from a journalist because Mexico is on the way to hell" he says.
Recently, on Friday night, journalists in Rio were sitting in front of the supply at midnight, when the latest number had been finalised, for example a coloured message.
In a ammunition between competing junglers and security forces, 19 people died on the land holiday site in Mazar.
The war was accelerated, as promised in the terms of the cartel that was found in the region.
Journalists gave news of their intellectual telephone conversation on the Riodoc website.
The site was to be reinstated on the following day.
The Swiss can go around - yet another amputation.
Mr Bogrquiz wrangle up police officers responsible for supply:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The supply of Riodoc continued the tradition of a murdered founder in the press under this massive picture, in which he seems to be centralising the whole of Sinasa.
Mr Brirquiez says that it is not even possible to contemplate an end to the activity; how can I end the newspaper when our trainees asked to get to the street on the same day that Javier Javier had been murdered?
The Hanu Mann Olympic project began with a huge setback - 'The place'.
In April 39 years of Hanu Manni's celebrations remained short, since the professional pilots began preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the period began with a catastrophe when Mannn became ill in flu.
It began with a long period of sickness, which took up almost five weeks.
In practice, the whole thing went out of the sickness.
First there was flu and, finally, there was the type of child disease I had to eat with antibiotics.
I was able to make planned exercises just 10%.
I do not remember when I have been so painful for some time now.
It was a hard place when I was not given access to training, Mr Mannn tells us to Santos.
The test results fell.
The World Cup of 2007 received a training permit only in the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU's routine test of 12 June.
In the test, sportsmen and women are sleeping with a flood of stakes whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the journey will stop at around ten seconds and test and take the fingerprint of the sportsman to the peak of the dairy acid.
Last autumn I had a period of 32 minutes, but now I have only 28 minutes.
Mr Mann says.
A better approach.
After initial difficulties, Mr Mann tells us that he was healthy.
I have carried out a wide range of peaceful exercises in which I have tried to normalise the material exchanging.
Now we have a very good five weeks.
It also took one and a half weeks to leave flight gay.
I am also able to visit my family in museums.
In the last few years, Management only participated in four world cup competitions before the Gulf Mundus.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Mr Mann came up with his peak to 18.
Guidelines have been withdrawn
Petter Kukov, the main director of the country and the chief executive of the national spectrum, has drawn up a training and competition plan up until February next year.
We are now looking for a different rhythm from that of training over the past period.
After Enzil, Rukaka would have the weekend of three world cupboys.
In December, at least one of the world cup's weeks, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be included in Sefind.
I hope that the name will then be found in the Olympic team's list, as Mrs Mann says.
The Olympic Games in Pyongechang would be the sixth winter Olympic Games in Manni.
The most important thing now is to remain healthy, at Salt Lake City 2002, we celebrated a glimmer of ground.
Scandinavian protection against his enemy by disguising its enemies.
First of all, it seems to be a frightening patriot.
Now, the scientists have revealed the first research results from the size of the Horange, which had been so well maintained, that the experts call it Mna Lia, the Scandinavian mining workers.
It was so good that the scientists could even say that its Finnish miracle was red and had a 'problematic past'.
According to the Curent Biology, it has kept tanks in the best way ever, in the world.
The fossil that has recently been found is a filter that is to say, at the middle of the period, 11012 million years ago.
Scientists find this astonishing fossil really important.
According to the National Geograph, tanks are the best fossil in their species.
It was found from the Suncor Millenim mines in northern Alberta in Canada on 21 January 2011, and the player was Shaw Funk mining.
He buried something that seemed not to be a natural part of the costs around and decided to look into the discovery more closely.
A fossil was sent to a museum in the Kallie of Tyrrel.
Fraud was brought up there for six years in the salmon of 1 100 kilos.
We now see the results of hard work.
'It is almost imagined that it was sleeping, 'says Caleb Brown, a scientist who works as a scientist in the king museum at Tyrel.
"It will remain one of the most beautiful and most sustainable Scandinavian areas in the history of science.
After all, it was clear from the studies that the beef-eating Scandinavian presence was probably a major threat to this plant fat, even though it had a tank and it reminded us of a burning tank.
The red white tank disguised its predecessors and also protected a greater and more turbulent colour that still exists in many animals.
According to the experts, it was thus better able to confuse its environment with its environment and avoid its enemies, its larger Scandinavian surgeons.
110 million years old ancient domains came into the headlines in May, and that is now the case in the King of Tyrrel in museum.
The scientists have given it their name from Boreaka to Markaschill, Mark Mitchell, a musefulness which took over 7 000 hours to raise the issue of Scandinavian.
Nododu has remained so astonishing that Mitchell and the international researchers have been able to determine the imagination and form of its body.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general colour in which the circle is more familiar and more elections.
It was, however, surprising because the Boreat is far greater than the present animals with similar colour.
It may be concluded that in the case of meat-eating Scandinavian vibrations, it has been reduced to the extent that the evolution recommended that it be a way of survival rather than a fight.
The current animals, for example, in euros, cement and armadillas, have the same colour, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, which indicates that the dose was also seriously threatened.
The merger of the 'large, strong tanks in Scandinavian' shows how dangerous the Neighbourhood was, Mr Brown 's words.
The chemical analysis of the marathon organic compounds shows that it was a red jigsaw.
Scientists will continue to explore their films in order to draw conclusions from their lives, including their content, in order to find out what it was doing in its last metaphor.
The scientists believe that it fell dead into the river and ended up in the sea where it lost its way into the sea.
Alberta was as close as at the time in Florde, and the rivers and seas probably went much further than they are today.
"This enlightenment is very significant because its Finnish lady has remained and has remained tripartite in its original form", Mr Brown says.
"Therefore, it seems almost the same as it did in the early age of an annexation period.
To outline it does not require much imagination: If you sleep a little eye, you can almost believe it was sleeping.
The season was a period of plutonium, a huge two-pronged, Scandinavian, which eat meat.
Although their King, Mr Tyrannosaux rex, that is to say, millions of years ago, its great predecessors may have oppressed this tank into the Scandinavian Earth.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaux, for example, included Aceticanthesus, around 1.5 metres long monster.
The most recent discoveries of researchers in the Nodou have been published in the Current Biology, who believe that the Bay of Borea was wasted after the death and changed.
It was found from the Suncor Millenim mines in northern Alberta in Canada on 21 January 2011, and the player was Shaw Funk mining.
According to museum, it has remained the best tanks in the world, with its shells and tanks, from the doll to London.
On average, five metres were long and up to 1 300 kilograms were printed.
Two semi-metres of photographs were treated from their ferries.
Scientists believe that this tank of plant cancer went through the current West Canada until it was transported to the open sea.
Its tanks have remained in a small detail, in a seamen.
Its fluctuated residues have remained so high that it remains in its cabinet in photographical boxes.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geograph that such maintenance is' just as rare as merchandise.
The more precise it considers, the more shocking it seems.
Its tank's photographical bullets are still fed up.
It has a real advantage in its village, five in the upwards.
I can also count on the protection of its base. "
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who is the streets?
British Ferrel was deeply shocked at 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day ago from his home St.
He then saw the message from his Luxembours:
'The police killed a young person of the age of 18, and his bodies are still on the streets'.
He was embarrassed to note that nobody else had provided the same information on his eating, which is why he closed Faceek and opened Twi.
His time was marked by a number of remnants from the user to TheePene Pharah.
The deputy name is St. Louska, who lived in Louwi, was killed in a real time by Michael Brown, who had been thrown up by an unarmed nineteen-year-old black Brown Fissson in Missouria.
This user had also posted a picture of the life-long bodies of Mr Brown on the street, in which it was submitted for a quarter.
"This is incredible", Mrs Ferrel thought.
But the death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twi later in the same evening, he was told that people would collect at Cancún Drik.
The users would remove pictures of police blockades and shouting people, as well as Mr Brown's father of a man who claimed himself to be a father in the cold: 'The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!'
Mr Ferrel followed a real video picture in which the police stood in front of the demonstrators with a burial dog.
He also tells us that he was also seeing a video in which one police triggered his walls and rumours: 'I shall meet you all...'.
"This is not normal", as Mrs Ferrel will remember.
"It was not the sort of murder that we are used to and could be described as typical.
Then I felt cold colours.
I was angry and I did. "
He reserved a return flight for the next day.
The machine dressed on one eleven this evening: Mrs Ferrel went to his daughter after six years and decided that she would go to Fergusson next morning.
What happened to Mrs Ferrel and Mrs Fergusson over the next nearly three years has been done with the documentary film 'Whose Street', which received its first-night cinemas at 11 to 2017.
Cinema is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Mr Ferrel went to Fergusson and his daughter, who is in line with it, they had another debate on what it is to live in black and under what conditions, they had spoken on countless occasions before that morning.
'Why when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in 'Ferrel reminds me that he said to her daughter?
"We are going to Fergusson because the police killed the 18th-year-old son and that is not the right son."
"I could not help but take the daughter", Mrs Ferrel said later.
'The events of today are the culmination of past events...
My daughter is entitled to know and grow.
He must be able to mobilise and organise, but he must also be aware of the different rockets and circumstances of the experience of living in black life, and he must know what we have to do to free ourselves, to liberalise ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
It seems to me that I would damage him if I were to protect him from reality. "
Their first stagnation in Fergusson was South Floristina Road, which is a police force which became the camp of activists when they were waiting for information on the case and finally found out that the police would not be prosecuted.
Then Mrs Ferrel and her daughter went to help a local businessman who made lunch packages.
They forced baggage and distribute them to the demonstrators.
Mr Ferrel began to take a new approach to the activists.
'Ferrel changed completely after 9 August ', he says that when he studied in Missour University St, Loud Ferrel was chairman of the Health Assistance Organisation of Minors, when he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
'I had no experience of organisation.
Somehow it happened. "
A week later, Mr Ferrel met in a demonstration at the evening with a Deputy Mayor of Sabah Folayan.
Mr Folay said that he and Mrs Lucas Alvardo-Farrar simply wanted to say what was happening.
Mrs Ferrel reminded me of a suspicion: 'Do you really want to tell us what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use?'
These were the countless times when people were born into the local community, mostly white people who simply wanted to benefit from their difficulties and perseverance.
'We heard that there was no common voice in Fergusson, 'Folay recently reported in an interview:' We wanted to do things differently '.
Mr Folay had already contacted the Deputy Deputy Director, Damon Davis, who is known to be activists for prisoners sentenced to death.
The presence of Mr Davis led Mrs Ferrel to join the project together with six other local authorities, followed by events in the years following the shoot of Brown.
"This is not a documentary in which somebody speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis says.
'The most important thing for me was the way in which local people are presented in film because I am presented in the same way '.
According to Folayan, the intention was not to concentrate on the experience of Mrs Ferrel, who wanted to show that 'the movement of people is not a caricature but a community', but which proved to be the most transparent.
This is why the documentation surprisingly identifies the private aspects of the life of Mrs Ferrel, such as love and marriage.
'I felt rather subordinate ', when Mrs Ferrel was telling us what it seemed to be the first time the film had been seen.
'But I understand that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability '.
Moreover, Mrs Ferrel's story once again brings the role of black women in the wider Black Lives Matter to midnight.
The movement was born in the social media following the amputation of the black theatre Tryvoy Martinin in 2012, two of the three founding fathers of the movement have a queri identity.
The 'leadership of black women' has maintained the whole movement, as Mrs Ferrel says, 'because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black women have had to endure everything. "
Mr Folaya agrees: 'The movement in fact maintains black women, including many quereer women'.
He underlines, however, that Mrs Ferrel was not selected for the sake of her 'self-interested' identity.
"He got the energy movement", Folayan says.
'It is no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line; black women live at a time when many things are being cut, and they have a lot to fear.
His energy will be transmitted from the White Paper. "
The descriptions teams have long left Ferguson, but the Community and the police are still under strain.
Mrs Ferrellet still has two and a half years left to stand and received a sentence on a motorway in the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate is short and concise: 'Chaos'.
Yet he remains confident of the slogan he drew out three years ago in the streets of Ferguson:
'We have a duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our coffee. "
Harmony: Artists create formulae for Ceyhun Manningin's DNA
In Floridmania, which is in New York, there has been an exhibition in the middle of the exhibition of faces - white, black and shameless faces - which can be seen more precisely in terms of integration.
These 30 works are the formulas of the artist, Hetaker Deweyen-Hangorg, based on the DNAs, which have been taken from Checlyle Manningen's post office and refinement.
Management sent a demonstration of the prison in Fort Leavenwort, where he carried out his 35-year sentence, condemning the leaking of diplomatic telegrams classified as secret to the Welsh Laxon site.
The Deweye Hangorg ABeking Resemnce was opened on 2 817 April 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Deweyn-Hangorg and Manningen, which brings technology, information technology and art together in its work, and Management is a trana and a pioneering dissident who was sentenced to Back Oamamamammag on the third day of his term of office.
Deweyn Hangorg analyses the DNA in the algorification of Manningin's DNA and created 30 phrases: A sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, position on the way in which DNA data is shaped, the multiplicity and the consequences on the causes of interpretations, as well as the identity.
Chechensea Manning, his native Brades Edward, has openly stated that he was sitting in women right from scratch, in 2013 he was convicted of 20 crimes, including the violation of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one image of Manningingen, sentenced to prison: A black, black and white shop, where the silence of Manniming is sitting on the car's seat; he has, in his view, a milestone cancelled, which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Deweye Hangorg had a great deal to gain from the Stranger Vision project that he carried out in 2012.
He created images on the basis of criminal data, for example, that of the indiscriminate and unwielding of tobacco and created images of how people concerned could have looked.
Then the artist received e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They challenged Chelsa Manningen and needed the picture", Deweyn-Hang told us a new exhibition at the information conference.
Mrs Mann was unable to visit, nor could she be described in prison, so the press contacted Chechenko and asked whether she would be interested in making Manningina a DNAA picture.
They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They have even jointly produced a series of Shop Images picking Shoolf Kanungo, describing the future of a future in which the President had mitigated the Chelyan judgment and allowed him to look at exhibitions.
In reality, the judgment of Obama shortened just a few days after the publication of a SARS paper, which was a happy coincidence after seven years of imprisonment in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against the information leaks and traliberal soldiers and is still inventing new ways of strengthening the strong divisions that he had to mitigate.
Deweyn-Hangorg believes that 'everything has its purpose'.
The Ghilia side of the world has the opinion of the artist and the great title of Manningingen, where the title is at the heart of the family, in which the artist calls for an end to the 'automatic division on which the sex, race, sexuality and culture are based'.
The opposite is that of the DNA period in Manningin: Long C-, Grand Application in the dairy village.
By means of this combination of 200 letters - or anonymity, as is the scientific definition used by the artist - Deweyroyal Hangorg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least our biology.
'I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genome and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations', Deweye-Hangorg says, and his video work in 2007 is also present.
'DNA tells us countless stories, 30 of which have been mentioned. '
The last piece of work of the exhibition is in its own room: The Manningen and Deweyn-Hangorg anomaly.
In that case, the figure of Manningen is in prison like King Kong, when he goes to me a megaf.
"If they were to be beaten, they won", the description reads.
'How be silent '.
"The text is a letter I received from Manningen" from the artist from Philadelphia.
'It is so impressive that I still have cold colours'.
Contrary to what was described in the Horn paper, Management has not yet seen any exhibitions; when he comes there, he will welcome the face of his own genetic data, like a number of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition.
It is deliberate, as all of us have done in this exhibition: For example, the Manningin DNAA period has been written on a lead card which is the same as his duration (157.5 cm).
'The walls were there in the past, but I wanted to bring a number of people to them, Deweyn-Hangorg says.
'I wanted to describe the mass movement that was created by Checlu, which was also behind his release '.
Professor of Northster University and Mr Oxford's university staff are being sought in suspicion of murder.
The police tell us that they have begun to find a university university professor in Northwegian and Oxford who is suspected of having a man cooked in a chicanian luxury.
The documents of the law of the insider of Cook show that on Monday the arrest warrant for Wydham Latheus was issued, 42, 56 from Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trington H. James Cornellet-Duranau, who has been subjected to the murder of the first instance without the possibility of freeing up against guarantees.
According to the documents, Cornellia Durant, 26 people died after he had been interrupted on several occasions.
According to a local information published by the Chicago police force, the body was found at 27.7.2017.
The police who were thrown into the Grand Plaza building found a victim with many wounds in his bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornellia Durant was found dead on the ground and a murder is being investigated, with the police actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a Deputy Professor of microbiology and egg logic in Norwewewewewster since 2007.
The Deputy Deputy Director Alan K. Cubbage, in his e-mail statement, stated that Lathem is now under administrative freedom and has been denied access to the battles of Northsster University.
'This is a criminal matter which is being investigated by the authorities, and Northesster University helps in investigations', Cubbbage wrote.
Mr Warren works as a parent in the University of Oxford.
An e-mail from the University and Somerska College says that 'we have been in contact with the police in Britain and we are prepared to help the American authorities in every way possible'.
In addition, it was stated that Mr Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope he will be.
Anthony Guglium, the head of the Chicago's Police Office, said he would urge the suspects to take seriously.
"The police have a view of their position and we are constantly reviewing our search," as Mr Guglium said.
According to Gugliel, local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
He told us that the police had received a telephone from the father of the Grand Plaza building who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the housing of 1008.
The police described the event as terrible.
According to Guglil, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told us that the safety cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
'We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship ', Guglium says.
The Grand Plaza management group published the following information to the people: 'The police are currently clarifying the state of affairs and the background to the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence'.
A man threatened to explode Islamic literature and 'kill Muslims' in London.
I am not an ancient Muslims, I am Catholic, sentenced to the police.
Moffolt must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
The 39th-year-old man was sentenced to his threats to explode Islamic literature in London and 'kill all Muslims'.
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moff was sentenced, for example, to serious harassment.
According to the police, they were alarmed by the staff of the bookshop on 23 May.
According to the staff, he had 'threatened to explode the literature trade and kill Muslims'.
The suspects went from trade after threats.
Moffat was caught when he wanted a threat to the police.
The threat was not related to what happened in the bookshop.
The authorities found that Moffatt had dressed in the same housing as suspected events in the bookshop, the policeman said.
I am not an ancient Muslims, I am Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in the hearings.
A man must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay EUR 620 pounds, that is to say about EUR 690, and compensation for victims of around EUR 85, or around EUR 95.
According to Scotland Yard's scientist, several hatred crimes are not reported.
'We will bring the WADA road map measures to a close in the near future '- the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Voice Musko.
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Vonly Musko, has said that Russia will shortly complete measures under the WADAs road map to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission in the United States.
"Part of the measures taken under the road map has already been implemented and RAD was entitled to plan and test the UK Anti-Doping Commission in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in these respects, "as Mr Musko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which defines the conditions for the restoration of the RDAA's mandate, which was recently published on the web site of the organisation.
According to Mr Mussa, it does not contain anything that worries Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to the WADA in the near future. '
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the study carried out by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, who is investigating the alleged contribution of Russia to doping in sport.
Mr Musko said: 'Research is under way because our anti-doping system has acknowledged failure.
All the measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit what did not exist. "
The words of Mr Musko were all well and good about the statement by the chairman of the Russian Official Anti-Doping Commission, Mr Vonly Smirrov.
Earlier on, Mr Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media on the same day, acknowledged that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies.
We are not going to approve the report unconditionally, but he added.
In November 2015, the WADA ordered RDAs to stop monitoring of doping in Russia, when the scale of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under international experts and UKAD supervision.
After that visit, Mr Olivier Nigg, the leader of WADA, visited the US headquarters in Moscow in July, said that the organisation was on the right track for the restoration of powers.
The British organisation's scepticism about the brutal innovation of the Finnish people: There is no evidence of the health benefits of voyage packaging.
The British organisation doubts the benefits of maternity maternity packaging.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardia tell us that the Lubu Trus organisation, which is fighting the death of hidden cells, prohibits the use of its own prospectuses in maternity packets in Britain.
The division of all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lubu truster, there is no evidence that maternity packets reduce the risk of death.
The death of flowers is an irreversible death.
Lubu Trust is a British health authority expert on the safe dream of a child.
We will not allow our official prospectus to be lodged, because it would give the impression that we recommend this product, the organisation informed it.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lubu trusts, Finland 's good reading is the result of a number of different reasons, such as the low amount of carcinogens.
Giving every family a strike could be one factor.
That cannot be said without doubt, however, as Mr Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce child mortality and conceal death.
Voting packaging is a Finnish invention and has been granted free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
Packaging contains different items, such as child clothes.
This year, packaging has 53 products.
The packaging itself is a packet to which children can be thrown into sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, all safety standards are met by the boxes it divides up.
Lubu Truss, for its part, says that there is no safety standard for packets.
According to Lubu truster, packaging can be the best alternative to a sleep place if there is no circle or photographs available.
The organisation recommends using packaging only for day-to-day baggage and putting an end to it when a child can turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pet animals out of packaging and ensuring that it does not grow or liquid.
Wolf dreams over and over again about Japanese animal infection.
The Japanese veterinary staff are looking for a kilogram.
The sheer kilogram has been surprised at the speed of the staff and has for the second time been in two weeks.
On Tuesday morning, a kilogram of the animal infected in Okayaya from Shibbuwa in Western Japan.
The security cameras revealed that the knife left the zoo via the guerrilla.
It is not dead immediately because it eats the grass around the animal herd, but we are very concerned, Mr Yoshimi Yamama, who is working in animal feed.
The 350th year-old lorry is a native, 5kg and around a metre.
Your taste describes the carpet as quiet and quiet.
At times of difficulty, you are allowed to travel freely in the area of the infection.
The animal has not been found in mutilative discoveries of a kilogram.
The previous map of Kok took place in the week before yesterday.
Your taste found the way around 150 metres away from animal feed.
I saw it on my way to the animal.
I Passenged my car and asked my colleagues for help, Mr Yama told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These explosives will help their businesses to avoid the mistakes of Ubi.
Amber Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his network business, but they did not work.
The answers were often vague, pointless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that these surveys are anonymous, some of them were sceptical.
"Questionnaires" were simply neither consistent nor objective, Mrs Erret says: Her husbandry management company focuses on the Net trade, with 75 employees.
The Errete decided to use external aid.
More and more new types of staffing companies have become on the market which will help other companies to find out how their employees can be employed.
They develop and list software which can measure the commitment of workers, which can carry out questionnaires and target certain accounts and groups, offer their employees anonymous information services and, in some cases, over-access to government.
'Own health can be monitored by applications such as Stralle and Fitbit', but where is the company's Fitbit? Asked the founder of Glinthia in Redwo City and the Director-General Jim Barnet, Glin, provides companies with analytical software and the commitment of workers?
Mrs Erret has spent three years of Glin 's software, who tells us that she had a more in-depth view of the ideas and feelings of her employees.
The programme will be able to make rapid enquiries and votes to some of us, and it will also be able to draw up a map which will see at one point what departments the workers are less dissatisfied with and which managers have had the lowest estimates, which enabled them to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realised that they have to follow the culture of employment so that they do not become the next Ubi; a haulage company has been bogged down since the former employee wrote a blank cheque of a culture in which workers are harassed and those who speak of problems are punished.
For such failings as Glin, such failures are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global activity which, according to the Let-wink pathway website, can increase to more than USD 18.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, the Converct in Condean State is a story which will help companies to identify and prevent improper behaviour, and the interest in the company was increased earlier this year when the Ubi reputation was a trip.
There are nearly 600 customers in Convercation, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Ubi.
Like Glin, Converct allows companies to carry out random questionnaires, to collect the answers in real time and to map out the problem areas.
Moreover, workers can report unjustified behaviour by means of a text.
And if the director is suspected of his innocence, the complaints go directly to the government.
'Public opinion has been sidelined by the authorities', according to the founder of Convercence and Director, Patrick Queen.
He reminds us that if a company treats its employees badly or does not operate ethically, the consequences may be expensive even if the authorities are not involved; consumers can start boycotting the company, and they can also lose workers and become a challenge to justice.
The company has used Converbi for more than a year, because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily linked to the headquarters.
In the past, if the employee wanted to report on the problem, he had to first clarify the telephone or e-mail address, which was able to make the declaration in the headquarters, and then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience", James Vitrano, the lawyer-general of Rubu, who said it was difficult to follow up the complaints made by the workers.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from the leaders in another town or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
'I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the reality of the employee ',' Vitrano, which is led by a risk management team in Ruby Tesday.
"At the same time, we shall protect our shareholders from the proceedings in the field of employment."
According to Quint, companies began to take ethics, values and the commitment of workers more seriously after the collapse of the auditor 's company in the Enron scandal.
It was only through the social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent their dirty request from being sorted out in public.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology became the guardian of ethics".
Glin and Converct provide their software as a service that is regularly charged with its use.
It is a business model adopted by capital investors and a possibility, and both Glin and Convercus have support for capital investors.
In February, Converct collected USD 10 million in funding from companies such as Sapue Ventures and Tonla Caplant, which totalled up capital of USD 47 million.
Glin received EUR 10 million in November from Besseker Partner and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investment is not surprising given the link between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, employees are waiting more for their jobs.
In a competitive market such as the Pillar valley, good salaries are good, and interesting projects are only the beginning of the day.
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
'Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they make their way in a company and feel that they are listened to and that their work has to be rewarded ', they say to the leader of the Linkad, Nina McQueen, who is responsible for rewarding and welfare.
Investors will be able to make a profit when companies prosper, and companies will prosper when employees commit themselves.
The third party's analytical tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is not surprising that they are interested in investors.
According to experts on night culture, information on the commitment of workers is important;
It is pointless, however, if no measures are taken.
If a company asks its employees to return, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if the change is not made quickly enough or nothing changes, it will be possible to reduce the commitment of workers.
'If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand debates', you say the director-general of the company, Kusselter Interpol, who has seen companies rely too much on simply collecting information.
"If the company does not take measures, workers will start to think about whether they have been consulted.
And do they have any difference of opinion?
If the company does not care about them, why should they send a company? '
According to Errete, Maduri Red is currently carrying out staff surveys monthly and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glin.
When Mrs Errete had collected feedback from workers who are frustrated in the slow decision-making process and in the quality of communication, she was able to make changes to our roads and organise communication training in order to resolve the problems.
Ruby Tesdam is increasingly aware of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve long-term staffing in a sector that is known as the high rate of change in workers.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers", Vitrano says.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there will be no companies. "
In Sweden, the 20-year-old man is suspected of describing his native female neighbour, the news office TT.
The woman living in Göteborg had come out of their home to see his windows out of the crowd at the end of the nuns.
According to a woman, the cabinet described the housing.
A woman who had suffered from the case had smashed into another room to dress.
Once a woman had arrived to review the situation, a hand had been pulled out, but soon afterwards the window has been recounted.
The suspected 20-year-old man has admitted that she died of women.
He claimed, however, that he only died of a woman's face.
The video described in the Knesset had been removed and the police had not succeeded in restoring it to the evidence.
In hearings, the man has admitted the act, but has denied the perpetrators of his crime.
The man who was beating was justified by saying that he love his neighbour 'absolutely mad'.
According to the press office TB, the case against a man will be prosecuted.
Teachers are calling for more tickets in the autumn negotiations.
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but rather the difference should be reduced, as the Official Chairman, Olli Luskka, said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holidays highlights the difference, as he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements which do not in any way involve cutting back on holidays.
Agreements in the civil sector will only come about once documents from the private sector have been signed and the increase rates know.
I am pleased to predict that the working conditions of the OAC, for example, have been agreed in January.
The Lusaka did not yet reveal the Prosal targets.
The former is also the chairman of the publicly trained negotiating organisation, Judaeo.
Lomaka: Cutting back on earnings will increase the disparities in income development.
According to OAC, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while the private sector is growing in power.
The sleep is that the temporary cut in allowances will further exacerbate the differences in income development.
In Finland, we need to determine how many pupils can be for one teacher.
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be guaranteed, as the differences between the best and the weakest are increasing all the time.
According to the organisation, the results of the learning process are falling and the differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the players in Bruinin, when NCAA reduced daily training to two.
It will soon be 11 p.m. in the evening, and a number of US football players have remained silent on the other side of the fight for new training fields.
Some of them have disarmed themselves, and they are hiding their backs after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few minutes, this boycott is the middle of the day.
After three hours of training, the players who study at the University in the summer courses will return to the housing profession to read the end tests, and the following morning they will be meeting half a seven football centre in Watanen.
"The next three days will be a strain for these massacres", Jim Mora, the Bruininer of Bruinin, will say a little before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of collective sport reduced the number of daily training reports to two, with the aim of reducing the number of players' jobs, but has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That is why the first three UCLA exercises started to take place more than seven night, and it was difficult for players to find room for manoeuvre.
Limiting the number of complaints in one day means that there are more training days, almost a week earlier this year, and this is the first time that Mr Moran has been able to do so during his six-day lifetime Westwoods's lifetime, while training is being carried out in the same way as summer courses.
The exercise is to take place 18 times before 20 August, when the actual preparations for the start of the period are starting: The UCLA (Texas A-M) in September.
Mr Mora says he has supported the change in the NCA Statute, despite the fact that it has made the timetable for players even stricter.
'We are burdening them for three or four days, and it is very challenging 'Mora says.
"But the players are prepared to work, they are fine blood.
I believe that the situation will be easier when we reach Saturday, when we will have more time.
UCLA is closing its activities beyond the camp; it is not easy, given the direct prospect of a training situation in a foreign parking area and in Lusska Center, a high-level hotel, which has already been bombed on top of the shelter network behind paint football.
The Bruinin players are to be changed to hotel next weekend, but Mora recognises that problems may arise during the period when rooms are available outside the Union.
"We have security arrangements", Mr Mora says.
'The concern is that people can afford to be miserly and describe the exercise to video, which is not an exaggerated concern.
Quite a few video descriptions are paid out.
But we have the guardians there and the parking area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to make too much effort.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will be held in Rwanda in Central Africa, whose victor is already made clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking a third period, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
The rebel group RPF then brought an end to the organised genocide of extremists.
We were Commander of the RPF.
Kagam has been criticised, among other things, for breaking up the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Mr Kagame will be able to work because the two-tier constitution of the presidency was amended.
In Rwanda, however, we are also a genuinely held leader.
At his time, social reform has taken place in Rwanda and international investment has been ravaged.
In addition, Kagmir has played a major role in combining a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
Kagam too, however, has promised more freedom for his people since the country has been put on its feet.
It could be a good time to start now.
Facebuk is fighting against the photographs by stepping up the verification of faxes.
Facebuk intends to send potential information to the independent verification of fax inspectors more and more frequently, and to present its results under the original article, which was announced on Thursday by the world's largest social network.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machinery training for the identification of photographs, which will be sent to the verification of faxes and which may be published under the original article.
Mr Facebio has been criticised for being one of the biggest protagonists of information, many people believe that the photographs had an impact on the outcome of the American presidential election in 2016.
This issue has been raised in a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with photographs before the presidential elections in May and Germany, which is preparing for the elections in September, supports the plan to catch up social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebuk announced in a separate statement in Germany that the verification of fax tests are carried out in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
'people want to see which infections do not apply to the screening of independent inspectors; they also want more background information to be able to decide more and more what they read and distribute ', Mrs Sara Su, the chief director of news cancer, wrote in the company bubble.
He added that Mr Faceek is continuing to test the relevant articles and makes other changes to his news in order to reduce the information provided.
The synthesis: Birds
A small bird in the county of Scots Kenin is now known as Squeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hidden place in the 1970s and 80s.
However, it has a hurricane history of 700 years, and now this fascinating place in the Bewl river basin is the subject of a series of books written by Jmie Rhodes, the writer of the old documents with molecules.
'I think it is good to get to grips with the text written by more than 300 years ago by Mr Rhodes.
'I know the personal connection when I look at the letter in my hand '.
The Rhodem book, A Castil England, tells the Middle Ages of families living in Scotte to the Middle Avardians: Each story has been the images of artists, a promising British monasteries: Ipc Lenitewicz, Briony May Smith, William Eilliley, Paly Iberg or Gbertig.
This is not the first book on the archives of Rhodein; in 2014, he published Dead Ms Teth and Other Stoes, whose source of inspiration was the documents of the British National library.
'I was moved by a cynical note in a letter to see a photographs written to the biologists in the 17th Century ', Rhodes says.
'This was his oppressed!
And the letters are coming from the smoke because they were used as a library at the time.
Three centuries later, the importation will give a lecturer the feeling that he is on the ground.
I love archives! '
The writer who went to the old documents was able to live in birds for nearly four months, with the support of the National Truss Foundation and the National Cultural Council in England, which seemed too good to be true, and admits that it was not too long to be in birds without delay than would have been desirable.
He spent days exploring a 'new' form, archives, treasury and orphans, such as leftovers fitted to the walls and trees that have been in power for centuries.
He evaded the old bird on the ruins and farms and discussed with forest guards, the timber industry and, at times, the performing artists.
Tonight, he 'took whisky and started writing'.
The proximity of Scots is rather unknown, since birds were only completely transferred to the National Trus Foundation in 2006.
When Mr Rhodes came here ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were just starting a breakthrough in the archives: Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for centuries with the same method: By exporting everything to the supermarket.
There were daily books in the archives, letters from the British empire about who owned what; 'one might imagine that land disputes are borderless', Rhodes says, but 'here the families are even killed by a single blow.
It was remembered that you would not be allowed to be already. "
Some of the stories of the book are progressing from birds to the history of England, such as The Labourer, which is a man who will soon be joining the British House in 1381.
The 'Knighty Familes of Kenet and Sussex' says that there was a lax in birds in 1380 ', Rhodes says.
The English peasant started in the same region, and it was remembered that the captain could start with a rift.
Perhaps these events are linked? '
Other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the bird, such as The Priest, the story that was hidden by the family of Darrel for seven years during the period of freedom of belief in England.
Mrs Smugler, on the other hand, tells us that the smugglers' smugglers are the 17th century of the story of Arthur Darrel, who is said to have reacted to her own burial by filling in the stone (it was seen years later).
Darrel is Rhodein's favourite family in Scotney, where 'men of the family seem to have been quite a pioneer, who were constantly thrown into debt and buying things that they could not afford.
The men of the Darrel House solved their debt by going to married old women, and I see them as commandments who were able to sleep. "
Now Mr Rhodes is looking for new literature experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a book on Earth, a cure children at the beginning of the twentieth century who are only left with a refined tonne.
Scotel's birds have a special place in his heart.
'It was sad to go there ', he says.
'I would not have liked to go back to the arena of the evil '.
Relations between Russia and the worst in the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably, commenting on the Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that the relationship between NATO and Russia is now more difficult than it has ever since the end of the Cold War, and Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we had hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Krim in 2014 and Russia's continuing instability in the region of Austria, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we can predict, we can enter into a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a deterioration in the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, found itself in a dangerous situation between the United States and Russia.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the poor conglomerates of the countries, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitsko will stop - a renewed attack on Anthony Joshua will not happen.
The long list of heavy world champions Vladimir Klitsko will end his life.
The Ukrainian Klitska, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Olympic Games in the Atlantic, Klitska, as a professional, took 69 times to win 64 matches.
He was in possession of different MMMs in the years 2000-02 and 2004-615.
Klitska lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury pulled him down in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitska met in Weeembley stadium Anthony Joshus and lost his feet at 11.
Joshua and Klitshell were expected to meet at the latest in November in Las Vega.
However, Klitska did not find the motivation to take action.
I used the purpose of a few weeks' decision to distance myself sufficiently from the Wembleyny, Klitsky, in his communication.
As an amateur and professional poker, I wanted to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing machine.
I am very grateful for that.
I see the Klitshell's arguments from the video of its decision.
In the communication, Klitchi Böte reported that the decision to end was difficult for Klitsky.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to end if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why it is absolutely right, Mrs Bötte said.
Since 2009, Klitska has been cluming with the American actor Hanoo Panetti.
Parish has one child, a daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshell's grandfather Vitina is also a former Horn World Cup.
Between 20812 and 12 brothers managed MMMs at the same time.
The Finnish weather is living under conditions: 'Takes off the feminist'.
Minna Nika, Settsman, has suffered from the conditions during the summer's external rail period.
Mna Nikca has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken women from the feminist.
There are also unstable conditions in the MMMPs in London.
Mna Nitanen is talking about spare.
The circumstances have been a male season against Mina Niraka.
I do not want to blame the border, but it was incomprehensible that I was not even able to get a small cheque to move around properly, after the Knnnskar cat.
I have been competing and practising how many times, and I have never experienced the same diversity in this place, as Mr Nikano said in Pavo Nurm Gamam.
During this period, it has been extremely difficult to stoning a flood when there have been so many unstable winds in practice as well, and the Nikkka said in Kalev.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
The time has come to get the technology up - whether it is cold drink or what.
It has been cold and wind, and it has taken the feminist.
It makes no sense to use energy in bad conditions.
He managed his smile thanks to 455 Murs.
445 have gone outside.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
We must be patient and wait for better wind.
The aim is to exceed 460 in the clearance of Fridays.
Why not treat abroad?
This is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I was given a sleep and the technology was interrupted.
Surely we should have done the same now.
Normally, it has been managed, and now it has been maintained.
What would be an ideal cat?
25 degrees of hot air.
A small wind will take place as long as it is a stone.
The experienced ex-post dawned politicians in Yle: 'We have no room for division or for many years'.
Despite the favourable economic climate, the Yuha Sirai Government must keep up its sleep and beware of staying the state budget with debt, warning the Ministry of Finance of Erki Virta, which has been preparing for decades.
According to him, there is no room for division.
In 2015, the public challenged the Virta in Ykkköster on Wednesday.
The construction of next year's budget is just beginning.
The proposals made by politicians recently to increase the guarantee pension, reduce the car tax and support for electrical cycles are seen as electoral speeches.
They are basically telling us that the elections are starting to be close because, when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debts, we do not have any room for division now or for many years.
I even think it is a mistake to talk about the allocation of debts when it comes to debt, Virtas said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt is debts to children.
It has a long experience of preparing state budgets: He started in 1978 as Secretary of Budgets and then worked as Deputy Deputy Director of the Budget Directorate-General and Director of the Budget.
Last but not least, he acted as Chancellor of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
Mr Virtanen pointed out in an interview that the growth of 3% now forecast is likely to be temporary.
Every forecaster estimates that this is a pipeline from which we are starting to lose ground next year, and Finland is waiting for a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a new immigration plan will change the rules of a permanent residence permit, that is to say the Gren Card.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 years, to tighten up the requirements for temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to nationals of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who will be able to live in English and able to live and who have useful skills for our economy, Mr Trump said in the media.
The side of the Danish Queen does not want to come in the same place as the Queen.
Mr Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margriey.
In April, the Prince Henrik and Queen Margriei will be described.
The Danish Queen Margrieta, 77, and Mr Henrie, the wife of this husband, 83, does not throw off the hook, tells us the Danish herd.
Traditional rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The royal House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Rokk judgment, the door states in his communication on Thursday.
According to the BTT, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the province in its role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the Princia has been dissatisfied with its role and Christians in the Danish monarchy, with the comments made in the newspaper by the Head of Movement of Holocay.
Mr Prians's decision not to throw him together with the Queen is a natural consequence of his not being treated on an equal footing with his husband.
According to the plastic, the Queen has for a long time been aware of the desire for a cemeterum of his husband and to understand the decision.
In the run-up to the hurricane: The car was on the motorway.
Most were unmarried and two small children in tears.
They were not injured in the event of an accident, but they will not get the money from insurance if the other party is not pursued.
The accident occurred in Keimolan.
The Arctic picture is developing from the II building country.
Vanatans Tommi tells her family that on Tuesday her family was able to cope with a miracle accident.
Mr Tomus, his unmarried partner, Mrs Rita, and two small children from the paritary council were driving on the motorway for Keimolante Vanta Hämel.
The accession of cyclical IIII to Hämel led to a white car driving the family's village, Tomus.
Without the movement of people, the car would have been involved in Tolin.
Mr Jrrur and I turned the car at the same time, and it was from the hands of Mr Tomus.
The family car came up at a very high rate.
Two small children were not injured.
One is a little less than 30th year old, the other is less than the age of the year.
It seems that it was quite a good infrastructure when we did not do anything.
No one who went beyond us, even though there was high traffic.
The accident took place at around 5.20 p.m.
More importantly, no one stopped to create them, and the family sown the emergency centre.
They got out of the car themselves.
The staff of Ambublski and the rescue facility were present and the family condition was revised.
The car went to the wind.
Mr Tomus tells us that he and unmarried couples have a small income, and they received help to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without information from the other car, the family will not receive any money from insurance.
That is why the family is hoping for a discovery of a car that has led the family to fall into line.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to the test and to do work without it, Mr Tommi says.
He believed that the car was white, a old figure.
It was probably at the end of the 90s or at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
In his opinion, the car register was the beginning of the car register.
If the culprits are not caught, I do not know how we will be economically affected, we will have to reduce every clock today.
Mr Tomo hopes that there will be contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the Police Office of the Central Ukrainian Country and from the Central Ukrainland that they have had a seat on Tuesday evening.
The title and the drink was corrected at 9.15 p.m.: The other car, contrary to what was originally stated in its journey, did not involve the future of the future, but was to drive the family's car out of speed.
The proposal steered by Lota Jampi deals with human relations by a humour - the Itsemantic disclosure is seen in the Meites theatre on Friday and Saturday.
The Lotta Job, from which he originates, brings his escalations to the Mestuary rather than the theatre.
The disclosure is the music theatre's motion for a human relationship and inadequacy.
The director, La Jib, still leaves a good deal to be desired.
This issue will be dealt with in a humble manner.
We must not lose sight of the age-old hours, he says.
The euphemistic summer theatre proposal has, according to Jäb, been carried out with a cracknic budget and with a large, young person's heart.
The title of the motion is challenging to consider what human beings reveal themselves when they look at the new human being.
Is he perhaps playing a role or is he approaching the second process?
The anonymous proposal confuses fax and fax.
The Jihad has both steered and drained the proposal.
He is also responsible for the light.
The proposal is made from the working party's texts and is not correct.
The director believes that, although the proposal amalgamates the ideas of young people, it talks of all ages.
The honourable Member underlines that his own and the working group on human relations does not directly report the Itsetia disclosure.
Fax and pharmacist are confused.
My own world of values will certainly be communicated.
I do not think that human relations are bad, but nor do I think that human relations, especially partnership, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from their parents who have been isolated.
The Judicial believes that the Itsetia expose a topical picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many people have learnt a great deal about human relations with their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least, we must listen to ourselves.
There is no need to remain a bad relationship.
The proposals show Mink Lund, Niklas Rauté and Otto Ro.
The working party also includes a pioneer Ella Snellman.
Music reconciliation is Job and Ro.
Love of the theatre was born in Kousvoy.
In the course of the theatre expression, Lotta Jampi, who comes from a baby, Lotta Jampi, 26, is studying in Tacidemy, the Academy of Turu.
There are two years behind us and there is another mood before us.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun over the years of Kovolann.
The increase in the number of panic categories has been a assistant to the theatre in Kumlan and has shown, among other things, the Ylipotonnaire in Helsinki and, most recently, the Linnateral in Turu.
Governance has begun to become more and more interesting.
Last week, in Helsinki, the scene was received on the Narri scene.
The proposal for about 45 minutes has also been seen in the future, at least in the town of Jihad study in Turu.
At 4.8 p.m. 8 p.m. 19 and 5.8 p.m. 14 and 19 p.m.
For a year, a Finnish Olympic winner recurred from a terrible motocrates accident - a camera crash.
Few sportsmen and women in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Jayour Lahitta.
The glass rose around the world hundreds of days a year and drowned its dream of the Olympic Games.
The dream was realised in 2002, but the movement in Lhina continued.
He was not only tireless trainees, but also experiments for new species.
There are probably not many forms of sport on the ground, which would not have been tested on senses, at least once.
It has inspiring to exercise.
Something new can always be found, Mr Lhlusa tells us.
At the end of the day, one of the fats was to put a stop to Lake.
In 2014, Lahitta was the victim of a motocrates accident.
As a result, his people and both hands were murdered.
I was not in any jobs.
The dream of the resident in my home year, Lalakina, says.
There was bad luck in Larray.
He also recognises that older people could have had their share of the coin.
Driving on a hot can sound like hot air.
But I did not apply for borders.
It is so hard as a species that this molecular four-fold is not too fitting!
After the accident, Lhetta was faced with a special situation.
His life stopped like that.
There was a long prayer in Japan's freeze-magazine.
The cloud started on the spot immediately after the end of 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my place.
I did not actually do very much, Mr Lharka tells us.
In the course of the revision, Mr Lharka often challenged his protection when he was in the crackdown and physics.
Surprisingly, stagnation was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally tired that our own ideas did not seem reasonable either.
Not even with regard to species.
It was good to be here.
I actually enjoyed it, because for once I was actually allowed to be.
The compulsory outbreak brought me to the Finnish headquarters.
Without stopping, he fears that he would have gone to the end.
It is easier to find places that have gone away from the Roma than the villages.
Without an accident, I would not have imagined that I needed to rest so much.
A few years ago, the Finnish freeze-maker magazine was launched.
At the same time, he introduced a safer fat for the species.
I have changed motocrates to frisbishopbool!
It went from scratch.
At worst, I was seven hours a day dwelling.
Although Larta has always been a superpower-driven tree, he does not require his livelihood to be the same as he is.
I am not forcing everyone into the same mutually.
There is room for our species to have their own culture and to become the best of the world.
Freettle is free, and the mentality has always been in line with it.
Ecologists will come and we must be concerned.
It is here: A report on technological developments in the sex industry - just as it had begun to feel that 2017 can no longer become more strange.
Yes.
The ecologists are now a great story.
The Foundation for Reimossible Robotic, the FRF recently published a report on the development of sex robs within the next 510 years.
'We must start to take seriously the spread of sex robs', say a member of the founder of the Foundation and a member of the University of Noel Sheffield, Professor Noel Sheffield.
Customers can choose the colour of robo in the eyes of the colour, the form of nucleus and the type of fingerprints.
"Towards" are being fed up, but they are already fairly sold and we will see more of them ", Mr Shakey said the report at a public conference.
The beans have developed from shameful pretexts to rubber-stabble with a warm dirty silicone and its creatures, similar to the use of human beings.
The user can also adapt robo to his own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the form and type of fingerprints and colour.
It is all the more worrying that Roma has' personality ', which makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
The beans have become robs with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of Realbox can be adapted to the preferences of the user, for example, for example.
True Comiton has pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems a baby, Wild Wendy is anonymous and so on.
'The personal nature of Roxxy Goldy is adapted as fully as possible to the personal nature of the user ', on the website of the company.
In other words, Roma regards the same things as the user.
It also has different opinions:
It may be tired, stuck or 'wind' for example.
There are many worrying aspects to the spread of ecologists, which replace genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the subordination of women and direct rape fanaticism, for example, when the user is approaching a bag and resisting the programme of Roma.
True Comito compares his website with Roxyxylylyla robo with vibraattoria:
'women have a bubrapie; why should men not have sex robo? '
It is not, however, just fubs or new sex lending.
Their proliferation and development reveal something more undeclared and deeper in our culture: A decline in gender equality, where oppression is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not have sex robore, and they are still in favour of margins, even though the FRR report reported on their increasing preference.
However, the margins say a great deal about the life of time.
And many people will only become bizarre or insulting when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that the sexuals are starting to become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are under threat throughout the world and in the White House there is a President who has praised his plight with women.
In Television, The Hague Handmaid 'Tale is not the most worrying description of its powerful body, for example, the pictures of the dreadful bodies and the outbursts of the mutilated eyes, the most being how realistic the world of a series is.
The Republic of Gileda is far from our reality, but it seems to be a surprising short journey.
Attempts are being made to do as much on the scale of real women as is technically possible.
The Robles developers want their ideals to become genuine and to trace the movements of human beings as well as possible.
Their 'personality' is a long way from reality.
The Roma is not in a position to leave either a relationship or a situation.
They have neither their own will nor their history - nothing to do with the fanatical cause of independence or total resignation.
They are a pleasant servant.
Oryria.
The police doubt: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia; the group was led by the head of Isin.
The leader of the extremist organisation Isin led a group of Australian men suspected of carrying a bomb on Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, someone belonging to Isman had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion is that the bomb was due to be carried out on 15 July, but the company suspended before the inspection.
The police do not tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a non-colourful glass of toxic gas and to take a plate to the public place, for example a public transport instrument.
The Deputy Commander of the Australian Federation, Michael Phela, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On Saturday, as a result of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police guards.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings are also continuing.
What are the advantages?
Let Mitt Romn look like common sense.
During the previous period, it has already been repeated that the strong divisions between the electorate have also broken down the family.
On the street of Christmas and the day of thanks, the adviser of American newspapers learnt how to deal with the relatives of those who voted for Trum.
We all want to break our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to the ability of Mr Trentin to bring families together.
I say this because my group was villaging me this week in New York: A left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been naïve against the republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a strong interactive effect.
Now that Mr Trump is in the White House, my group is all familiar with - including a republican sister with whom he has been arguing for decades about politics - with suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
On the table, this is a good thing, but, in a broader perspective, there are significant risks.
Mr Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all right.
When we talk about Trentin and 'normalisation', we are talking about the terrible possibility that one day we will no longer be shocking his trick.
In the long term, there is an even more terrible possibility that Trump will normalise the right extreme republicans, who, compared with the Trum, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
Let me remind you of the hesitant version by Mitt Romney of madness: Cook on the car's street, 14% tax (and indeed his tax statement), which, compared with the hardest, seems to be very slight.
Once the Czech era is over, the Republicans' next presidential candidate will only have to be clear-sightedness, and that would appear to be a substantial improvement immediately.
When I was visiting me, we took our children to the cart of the central puppet, the largest cardboard in New York, and the best that will be obtained from three dollars in New York without clubs.
The horses of the mad horses are enormous, the outlines in the middle - irreparable clones and horror animals - are pathogens, and the underlying kilogram of music is grotesque.
In time, many of the hallmarks of New York are disappointed: The prospect of high buildings begins to be fed up, the city's name becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not reflect the dreams.
After 35 years, I still have not reached the point where Swiss Cotge is not a Swiss mould, it is a large haulage in northern London, although Ye Olde Swiss Cotte is a Swiss-minded publ, but not counting it.
On the other hand, there is still an odd glimmer of living - even to the extent that two two-year-old, one-year-old and two four-village women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given you full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
On the other hand, I was asked this week in the freight House to assess my 'payment experience' by one of the five stars before I entered a credit card.
The same thing happened in the coffee of my home, but I am also given the opportunity to combine the 15% service money when I go to the coffee.
This will slow down day-to-day interaction and put pressure on the customer to put his personality in a situation where it is not necessary.
The trader of the goods market smiled as a deplorable situation when I was tireless in giving my credit card five stars.
Shefki Kuvi was given the pottage from INTERREG - 'I was not the trust of the leadership'.
Today, FC Inter has freed Shefki Kuq from the role of a team of representatives of the club.
Responsibility for doing so lies with the former assistant Fabritz Piccarte.
The rest of the validation group will continue to do its current job.
The Italian Piccarta has been a assistant in the past, for example in the English Sunderland.
The 51th year-old Piccarta, who joined the Intergroup in January, has carried out the UEFA Pro licence last year.
The chairman of the FC government, Stefan Habsburg, regrets this.
Changing the lifetime is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had any confidence in the leadership of the club, which meant that there was no other option now, in the information on the club.
The Piccaretta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He, together with the rest of the enlightened group, is responsible for the HIFK as early as tomorrow.
According to information from the Illows, the team has been bleeding for a long time on Thursday.
Mr Kuvi told the players on Thursday morning that the assistants of the club, Piccarte, and John Allta, have been sidelined.
Mr Kuvi and Mr Piccarta took a strong stand at INTERREG last Saturday against PS Keat.
Linda Lampius published a young picture of the 80s - would a serious sunset student be identified?
In Instag, Vuuutui Linda Lampeus published a young picture.
The description has been added to a number of distressing situations in which we can conclude that the music is a 16th-year-old Sibelius Acateau student.
A young woman in the camera is also seriously wondered.
A long time ago, he sends out a signal.
If you do not see it, you can look at it.
In the past, Lisbon has published images of its past and has also talked about painful issues.
Just a year ago, he published a few descriptions in Instag.
He was seen as a mother of two children 20 years ago.
In his text, Lampey is thinking of his own growth as a human being and refers to the disturbances he suffered at a younger time.
Just twenty years ago and today...
I still look very much like that 26th-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learnt to hold myself and what I see, Lampey wrote.
Having studied the text, he had added life, disruption, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-confidence, love of himself, 1996, 2016, the elderly, girl, women, old age.
Lisbon has spoken openly about its eating horses in previous years.
He was 14 years old in hospital because of his standards and orphans.
A little later, he was also affected by his bubleum, which was eventually discovered only in 2006.
Improvements started with little progress.
In addition to therapeutic and comparative support, the Lampey helped a new love.
Oscar Pistor was sent to prison for breast trees in hospital.
This is the second time that Pistous was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year he received hospital treatment for the excesses he had in his beaches, according to the prison authorities.
Mr Pisus was sentenced to murder for the original death sentence of public prosecutors.
He killed Mr Saur at an early hour in 2013 by shooting a number of flowers through the WCC door at his home in Pretoria.
Mr Pistos claimed he thought his daughter friend was a night-stroke in the WCs.
The public prosecutors have told us that they are going to complain again, because they see the judgment of Pistou for six years as too low.
The Public Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with as early as this year.
If the complaint is adopted, the Pistou judgment may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgar citizens were arrested for unlawful breakdown in Greece.
Two Iberians who were illegally cleared were arrested in Greece, announcing the country's Foreign Minister on the basis of the BVT channel.
The police arrested a number of promised people in Sithonia on 1 August, including two Bularians.
They were still released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to the TV channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced that it had liberalised Bulgar.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules for the free clementines and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are isolated in areas other than the areas for which they are intended.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The minister announced that the right to fine.
The Nesa share sinks - it has already fallen by 7.7%.
The share of the oil processor Nesama has fallen by 7.7% to around 11 p.m.
The outcome of this was lower before taxes, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financia.
The trade in pigs has started today on the low side of the coercive, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Just after the opening up of the stock markets, the large European Stoxx 600 index had entered 0.2%.
The Helsinki index OMEXH had fallen by 0.3% to 909.48 points and OMXHH25 had printed 0.3%.
The overall exchange of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were made public this morning and a barrier.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may relieve the symptoms of irritation.
Red meat and chocolate may sound from the nightmare of the food-feed system.
A recent study, however, claims the opposite: A food litany containing a great deal of meat protein and milk products may facilitate the syndrome of an irritated sludge.
The irritating syndrome is an incurable disease which affects around 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain, causing unwieldy shampoos, peat, repeated or blood shortage, loss of weight and extreme tiredness.
Those suffering from the symptomatic syndrome are usually called upon to avoid meat and dairy products, but the researchers in Washington found that the necessary minoid acid in protein helps the elite to develop immune cells which strengthen the edifice.
According to the director of research, Marco Conann, immune cells are guarding the shelter and ensuring that the harmful microbians do not get into the body.
Cells that produce these cells are balanced, which strengthen their edifice, which protect the organ without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too close to infection, the result could be a syndrome of an irritated suffrage.
Experiments have shown that immune cells which strengthen their ethyl are in particles with a certain bacteria in their suckler creature.
The bacteria in question needs cluster to start with immune cells, which is one of the protein buildings.
'We found the link between the development of Lacobisbillus and the development of cells for the promotion of ethyl-ability, which is part of the normal microbiomass in the sun, Professor Colomon.
"The more molluscs were in the diet, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same applies to people, the combination of a diet containing Lacatobillus and a great deal of cluster can strengthen the reliability of the sun and reduce future sensitivity.
When research was carried out into immune cells, Dr Lusa Cervante-Barraga, the research director for Science Science, found that, although one of the dogs had such cells, they were not on the same dogs that were kept separately from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to the microbies of the mouse, that is to say, the normal community of bacteria, that is to say, the food canning channel and the viruses.
When research was carried out into the suckler delta DNA, six bacteria were found on ferrets with immune cells, but not on other carcasses.
When the Lacatbillus retardants were given to steril grown in steril without microbials in the sun and without immune cells, they started to become immune cells.
Scientists wanted to find out how bacteria had an impact on the immune system; they increased the Lacatobillus in the literacy of liquid and moved small liquid quantities - without bacteria - into immature imbalances that have been isolated from mouse.
Occupations developed into cells that strengthen their edifice.
When active ingredients were cleaned up from liquid, they proved to be a by-product of the transformation of cluster, which is known as an indoctrine of milk.
When the scientists doubled the number of cluster in the feed of mouse, the number of cells which strengthen the ethyl increased by around 50%, and when the number of cluster was halved, the number of cells fell by half.
According to Cervanteens-Barragan, human beings have the same sentiments as mouse, and most of us have Lacobillus reactors in our diet.
It is not yet known whether cluster by-products from Lacobillus retardants will be able to develop human beings in the same way as mouse, but those suffering from the irritating syndrome have seen genetic errors in cluster.
'We certainly want to contribute to the development of these cells because they regulate the inflammatory infection on the sweet, Cervantes-Barraga.
The 'high level of cluster pharmaceuticals, combined with Lacobillus retardants, may contribute to their becoming more common. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester Union was able to get a 'anomaly' after concluding an agreement with Nemania and Matica.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester Union was able to reach a 'anomaly' after an agreement with Nemania and Matica, a central player in the river of Manchester Unites against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Mr Matic, who went to Matic by USD 40 million, started with a victory in Dublin, before the UEFA reduced Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, was impressed as a mediaeval player against Paul Paul and Andreas Pereira.
Matic was not yet in the best condition, however, because he was not involved in the Asia quarrel before the start of the period, and he only got to grips with 45 minutes in the field - Mourinhos says that it will change before the beginning of the lifetime of the lifetime.
'he needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mentality make him anonymous - he has a creative football mentality, Mourinho says.
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later '.
Not only Mr Matici, but also the newcomers, Victor Lindvif and Rocu Lukashenko, were starting a game in the Aviv stadium when Mourinho started to paralyse his start-up.
Independent has returned this week to the fact that Mourinho still wants three more players, even though the club has already done 'excellent work' by providing three of his four priority players.
'three - and this should be applauded ', he added.
'I am pleased to receive all four, but they did an excellent job '.
Germany was embarrassed by women of Lentow for two parts.
The fourth match of MMMM crash lost Finnish women directly to Germany (325, 2325, 225, 1425, 1425).
The level of routine in Germany is high.
Their fears were equal in every sector, Tapio Kangatsniev, the Finnish chief accountant.
In the first two, Finland kept its opponents under pressure, but in the third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany will lead to salmon.
When we were patient and aggressive enough in certain places, that was what Kangatski said.
The most effective Finland had 14 points collected by Pia Korhon.
Finland, which has lost four matches, still has Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: A major jury has already sent challenges in connection with the Trump Jren meeting with Russia.
In the United States, a major jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jrd and Russian lawyer Natalia Vetanski.
A great Russian lawyer, convened by the prosecutor Robert Muf, has already presented challenges in connection with the meeting of the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veucelso, known as Donald Trump Jrd and Kremlin.
The news agency Reuter, which, at the same time, confirms the convening of a large cabinet crew of information which Mr Wall Street Journal revealed earlier on Thursday.
According to Reuter, a major jury has sent a meeting with the Veeltric, known as the links between Trump Jren and Cremits, which took place in June 2016 in the US presidential elections.
The then campaigner of Donald Trump Srat was also present, Paul Malafort, the then leader of the campaign, and his sentiment, the current adviser of the White House, Jred Kusher.
According to the Reuter sources, the fact that the special prosecutor Robert Mulle has convened a large cabinet in Washington means that the pace of investigation in Russia will be enhanced.
The sources add that Mr Musar wanted a great deal of lightweight crews to help us investigate Russia's involvement in the American presidential elections and whether he was conducting a campaign or cooperation with Russia in this area.
The big jury extends the rights of Mur to collect evidence, to send challenges and to force people to prove in a false manner.
There are a large number of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The big jury weighs on the evidence that the prosecutor is investigating and decides whether prosecutions should be prosecuted.
British cowboys ruined themselves in order to get their homes and their cars off the ground by swimming in hand.
The first British chemist in the whole country has micro-chips so that he can open his home door, get to his office and get his car off the ground.
The microchip is between the 33th year of Steven Northam and the finger, and now he provides a service to companies and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam is cooperating with Geoff Watson, the councillor in the province of Royal Hampshire in Hantster, in order to meet the medical requirements.
Mikrochips uses the same technology as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its attitude takes only 30 seconds.
Northain's attempt to change the number of houses and cars in line with the microchips, which cost GBP 300 to deal with one Club.
Northam is married and has one child: He has inserted microchips not only in his home but also in his BMW Z4 car, which begins when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The exhibition of the White House cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
The final decision of the White House to fly the helicopter of the maritime forces to the southern hemisphere of the White House was to pay USD 24 000 to the taxpayer for the event that American production was presented, which is reflected in the documents received by the TIEM.
Mr Marine One, the White Sigrazsky Veil-3D helicopter, is being used as a deputation to the President's cynical event in the White House on 57.2017 American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of officials in the White House were familiar with the products from all 50 states.
Apart from the helicopter boat manufactured in Cotctic, you had sailing from Main, the fire car from Wisconte and the flowers from Missip.
The Military Office of the White House had requested only about 36 hours before it was landed to the southern hemisphere 'exceptional' event, as indicated in the documents of HMX11a helicopters from maritime forces.
'I just wanted to ensure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event, which gives much visibility ', the Deputy Deputy Commander of HMX1a wrote the day before the event to an e-mail commander, who is the Deputy Commander of the Department of the Sea Forces.
The message was that helicopter would arrive in the southern landscape at 57.7 p.m. in the morning and that the event would start three afternoon; it would only leave the place after the walls were exhausted in the evening between six and nine.
It was also mentioned that if a helicopter from the White House were to be delayed, then another crew would be needed because of the restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in helicopter at the time of the event and the staff of the unit were in helicopter when it was there.
The documents received by the TIEM are not clear as to whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The American Honch Acet Act prohibits federalist workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HXX1 asked whether the law was violated.
'one of our questions was whether this was a violation of Hatch Act law; we were told that it was not a violation, the Commander wrote.
"It sounds as if you can take part," the Deputy Commander replied.
Mr de American was an official event in the White House, so it was not covered by Honch Act law.
But even official events have political implications.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of a health reform in the Senate and a less rigid state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them for their journeys;
But it is unusual to use them for photographs.
The action taken by Air Force One gave rise to the presidential campaign in Melbourn in Florida, which has strongly criticised the use of a presidential aircraft in Twiter.
'The White House is very pleased with the Made de American event, which presented products from American workers from all 50 Lindu Walters, the secretary of the press secretary of the White House, Lindu Walters.
The crews of the HX1A regularly make training flights in Washington and operate in the southern corner with the precursor-cents of the President.
When Trum was at the GAR-2020 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX1 made 58 training landing in the White House.
According to an official, flights to the American event were included in the monthly training quota for crews.
On that day, the helicopters of the unit were also given eleven hours in their mandate of support.
According to the White House, no other cost was incurred to the taxpayer.
The spokesman for Siksky told us that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter in the southern hemisphere in the White House.
HMX1 has no accounting for flights to the President's office, and the precise evaluation of the costs of the event is difficult.
By way of compensation to the Defence Minister in 2017, the level of compensation for VHR 380 aircraft is 24 380 dollars.
According to the documents of the HX1A, flights from Quantique to Virginia to the White House took up a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using helicopter is considerably lower.
'calculating the cost to the taxpayer according to the level of compensation is misleading ', as Mr Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunset costs, which are taken into account in annual budgets."
According to a study carried out by the RAND research company in 2015, reimbursement levels do not contain staff costs, but they take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract.
At the time of the event, the former Press Secretary of the White House, Mr Spicker, was in favour of the use of helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to present American production", as Mr Spicker said.
'I know that Mr Sivarsky and Mr Coctic's state are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and therefore certainly employ hundreds or thousands of people.
I believe that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopter and other defence equipment, for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is entirely appropriate to point this out. "
It is not certain whether he went to Trum helicopter at the time of the event, but at least he brought fire drivers to the site.
In the White House, Mr Trump fled to the press on his own Sikpesky ship.
'I know Sikinner very well ', the President said:' I have three.
The secret fell into the Vatande - trains will have to be replaced by buses.
Passenger rail transport between the river and the Vatanen is different because of technical innocence, announces the Ratallah centre.
For the time being, the train will be replaced by road vehicles.
The defective of the system of depository led to the excuses.
The Road Transport Centre did not yet have an evaluation this morning of the duration of the correction.
The Venezuelan public prosecutor is calling for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative.
The Venezuelan public prosecutor has sought a court ruling which would prevent a new country from being appointed.
The President of Venezuela, Nicola Maduro, has announced that the elected representatives in the vote last Sunday are due to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, representatives from a country were elected, which could, for example, change the constitution.
According to Mr Medina Ortega, the decision on prevention has been requested for the sake of electoral fraud.
Mr Medina Ortega has also begun a vote on an election fraud inquiry.
He appointed two judges after the British company, which held the roll-call vote, told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was around one million more than the number of real voters.
It was only on condition that Maduro's allies were present, and there are also Maduro's boy and her father in the 545 Members of the European Parliament.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the representatives can break the congress led by the opposition and change the law.
Maduro was described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitution as a way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called this a dictator.
The European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have stated that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro maintains that the new representation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in that country.
For months, the unrest in Venezuela has continued.
Many people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis when oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is expected to demonstrate its opinion on Friday too, when the new representation is due to begin.
A Russian man handed over from Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States.
On Thursday, the United States condemned the 41th-year-old Maksim Senah for four years of imprisonment in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the American demand.
According to Fontanka, Senah was on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed over to the US judicial authorities in Senah in February 2016 despite Russian protests, the press office AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March of this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after his sentence.
After the arrest, the Russian Foreign Minister strongly criticised Finland and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia being aware of this in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Mrs Senah had used the Ebury virus, which took tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish the names and the words of the user.
The brakes then used the data by continuing to govern intermodality, which led to dirty fraud and to spam being disseminated.
According to Mr Kenneth Blanc, the Department of Justice and Home Affairs, the case shows that the United States is also able to share with regard to the other active Cyberian criminals.
We have the ability and the will to identify, find and bring them to justice, as Blanco said in the press.
At 8.58 p.m., the name of the convicted person was corrected.
The trench of Narcom's third production period: Pablo Escobar is out of imagination, so the Calizi cartel will become the main player in the Netflix particle.
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was found in Narco's second production period, Netflix is certainly not over.

Cari Kola carries out an exceptionally literary works in Paris
An oral photograph, Kari Kola, is carrying out an exceptionally literacy works for the first day set out by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
The Kolan is doing a job of lifetime in Paris, called Day and Nigeria.
The works are lighting and darkness - day and night - sun and die.
The headquarters of UNESCO and the Global monument represented by it.
I would like to highlight not only the light but also the lack of clarity.

Two men killed at the park of the Trade Centre in Espoo.
On Wednesday morning morning, a dispute was created between two men in Espoo on the British Omenan park.
According to the parties involved, the dispute came from when the other party went down the banned route.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver driving in a banned direction would be ruining another car driver, resulting in this car leaving a car with a collision.
He then stamped up a burgeoning car with the machine.
The man has admitted in his introductory speech that he has caused damage and done his job wrongly.
The title of the question from Tumo Soin was: 'Then the watershed became a watershed'.
On Thursday, the Foreign Minister, Timo Soini, published a Blogig book entitled 'The question marks'.
It is a short letter, just two words.
At the time of my time, the party became a government party of thirty-seven Members of Parliament.
Then there was water purification, now all sleep, Mrs Soini writes.
The Saint text contains indications of France in the 17th century.
It is known that King Ludvig XVV, or this corner mada de Pompathurdo, has used the comparison of water.
According to interpretation, the words' after us are watered down 'or' after me 'have remained in history.
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women.
Elections will only be representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, on Wednesday, the leader of the UN delegation in Afghanistan.
Baras Nicholas Haysom, the interim leader of the UN Assistance Council, said that there are hundreds of women in elections to provincial councils, three women seeking to be Vice-President and more than 30% of the voters registered recently are women.
'The role of women cannot be overemphasised ', Mr Haysom said in his statement of Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan province councils and presidential elections will take place at 5.4.2017.
The Taliban has presented threats to the elections at a time when international forces are moving into a consultative role.
The elections this year are the first time that power has been shifted from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Election Company, 1.2 million of the voters registered in Afghanistan are women.
Friday is a rainfall and a wind.
Fridays bring a great deal of rain to the south.
In the urban areas, the weather is identical and quite wind.
This afternoon, the cloud is burdening and can develop solvents.
There is a clearer and more poignant evening.
The Sfronts bring with them the abundant rainfall in the southern and central parts of the country, and there can also be a juke in the south.
Last night there is a south-west wind and a clearer one, one in which a hundred rainfall can still come.
Today's temperature is around 15, more integrated off the south-west coast, close to 50 degrees.
In the north, clouds vary and become local afternoon heats.
During Friday and Saturday, the low pressure is dominating the weather in the south and central part of the country, and the pollution is common.
In the north, the rain remains low.
Saturday, in the south and central part of the country, there are hundreds of seats, including juvenile.
It also extends to part of Kalima.
In the north, the blame is abundant this afternoon and will be individual rainfall.
At lunch off the southern coast, in the central and northern part of the country, the air virus is on its side.
There is a strong low level of pressure on the British islands, with a radiation that brings abundant rainfall to the south of Fennoscha.
In Western and Central Europe, there is a Western Memorial air virus and there will be a few hobbic rainfall.
In southern Europe, the weather is suckler and hot, and temperature is somewhere above 40 degrees.

Risks to the culture of certain types of tourists
The authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rubish is particularly targeted at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it 'eat and fleam' tourism: There are only a few hours on which to catch up and where large numbers of people can see.
The Venice is caught up in short-term accidents in the town.
It is difficult to move around the streets and the beautiful statutes are so full of visitors that the Venice people will no longer be able to join.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre, while hotels have become on the home.
The problems posed by tourism in Venice are The New York Times and The Guardia.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourists.
They call the current phenomenon poor-quality tourism - loyal Tourism.
When a large cruise vessel arrives, it will be given two or three hours.
The doctrine of the Zuralia flag, Pizale Roo Rialton, and the Pope Markus, has turned back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister for Culture, Dalao Franceschuini.
The anniversary of the Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the activities of places, shops and workshops.
We must maintain this part of the identity of towns.
The holy Markus is also one of the most popular visits to the Venice Centre.
The Holy Marks Church is on the edge of the towers.
Local anger also mainly affects cruise ships.
50 000 local people live in the Venice historic centre.
In 1951, there were around 175 000 people.
In July, an estimated 2 000 fishermen were demonstrating against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the people out.
Around 2 000 people are leaving every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will only be tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anchronological and historic disaster, saying that the demonstration was organised by Carlo Belfra.
The equation is difficult because ships import the income that they so badly need and create a need for a large number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of people, it is proposed that the risk-users should go further than the historic centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bort, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Venelto administrative area, where Venice is also situated, were to be given more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 2030 million tourists are visiting Venice every year.
Do you expect to drive in the Kuopotage?
Motorway-wide congestion
On Thursday afternoon, the motorway between Kuado and Siiberia has had a return on Thursday afternoon from work to traffic in traffic jams.
The region is carrying out a motorway-driven work, which is slowing down traffic, describing the messages of Mr Savo.
The speed limit of 50 km is 50 km rather than the normal speed of 120 km.
However, in a 50-kilometre border area, traffic had progressed in practice on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, road work will take place on the Siberia side of the Ilimus statues, that is to say the golden distance.
I will do well without such attention.
The 230th year-old drinks have had to see the baggage of the public.
Amlie Iuel has published fantastic images of himself in the Grand Canyon landscape, for example.
The Danish Norwegian Amlie Iuel has become a popular sportsman in his current country, Norway, not least because he was in breach of the 400 metres of the old Norway record 26 in March, by circumventing the Round 581.
A month later, he improved the dispute between 400 metres at 5.38 in the Norway record.
Soon after his record, Iuel, the social media, was able to see that there is a shadow over belonging and public opinion.
Men around the world apparently started to send images of their gender body to Iuelel in the hope that young drinks would be interested in them.
The Iuvorian was forced to exclude its Snaphakesman.
I received a great deal of 'crazy photographs' from unknown people, so I had to turn my accounts into private, Iuel told the VGs.
In an interview with the VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly the images he received.
You can imagine, Iuel enjoyment.
It is painful to have feedback after the start, but I will do well without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Dane, a Dane.
The Iukorian family changed Norway during the 21st century of Amalien.
When Amalians were 12 years old, the family changed first to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
Then there was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athletes (the Union of Southern California) in Los Angeles, who returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship to Norway.
In Norway, Iuel is exercising the three academics, Lef Olav Alnce, Kary Warishop and Elisabeth Slengm.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, whistle-blowers do nothing, but simply prescribe rules.
In Norway, the lighter has much more time to deal with the sportsman personally, Iuel said to the VG.
Ambrie Iuel holds up the records of Norway in 400 metres and 400 metres of dispute.
A father was killed by a sledgehammer, Jyour Korakas, on the whole of his career - now in Murat: 'Nice when you do not get anywhere'.
Now it has been nice to calculate when nothing has happened!
Javier Korik, who reads from the most successful ferry player in Finland, has, in fact, once again been able to enjoy its lovely species in the course of this period.
Last summer, the continuation of the career was at stake.
The fat at on the table in January had been forced on the Korakas boat table and there was nothing to improve.
The King had also taken the biscuit.
In the summer, I did not know anything about whether or not the boat will continue.
Sponpodians were on the brink and many things were open, Mr Korakas says.
But it is said that it is customary.
The feet improved, sponsored the agreement for two years, and the blood began to pupple again.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that at the very latest when I was on a cloud.
I was told that the horse, but this is so nice, will be dragged through a few more months.
It was only in October that Mr Korakas got down to a proper reduction, but, after a long downturn, it has been a great success.
Only a few have been circumvented by the Korakas.
This does not damage.
Competition has never been the main catalyst of the plate.
I have never calculated that as a result of one cat.
Mr Mussa believes it is frustrating to target four years for cats, and then I assume it in six weeks' time.
I do not think so, Mr Korakas says.
Today, the Korakas is in the hands of the MMounda in Sierra Neva in Spain.
Although he is not kept in the hands of the individual cats on the plate, he always comes out of the cat.
According to the Korakas, the games organised by the International Cultural Union have increased over the past few years, even though some of them opted for Norway XXXth Gams at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, the visibility is great.
However, it always depends on the conditions and the level of the cats.
The Korakas is the oldest sportsman of Finland's 12th intellectual team in Sierra Neva.
The team's teams, Ree Riantigag and Emmi Parkashenko, are 14 years younger.
It is difficult to follow the consumption of younger blood.
I remember when it came to the fact that everything was new and was so enthusiastic about everything.
It itself brings new impetus, and Mr Korakas wonders.
I am still at a standstill, but otherwise I will not be able to do so.
In the light of the Lauge career, Javier Korakas has also built a different sports career.
The legendary Peka Korave's boy has become bogged down in racial sport: The player has its own horses, to whom he makes the mainstreaming programmes.
When I am on the brink every time I am on the brink, it will not be enough to be there.
But every day at least I see the results of the border and, in general, something of the origin, Mr Korakas says.
Steering and border education are, according to Corpore, a potential career plan when a merger comes to a conclusion at the time.
I do not think so far, but it is at least likely.
I see it as a bit like a snapshot.
I will try to keep up with the time and develop, perhaps in the summer there is something to be done.
If it is a future profession, it will not be difficult to start when it is already within the species.
The drinks also include the Elitcus rape with Jajano Linnon.
The Kamnesia has bolted a cruise vessel which is going down to Stockholm by the end of May.
Mr Korakas and Mr Lund decided to reinvigorate their old heritage.
The risk has been very commercialised and people have been enthusiastic.
We are already at a point where there is no bankruptcy at all.
There are still a few months left, we hope to get a ship full, Mr Korakas says with his enthusiasm.
Attendon hotel project to Kite has been surprised by everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new diet for people of 41th age who are to be built in Cite.
The building of a large 1 700 layer metre will be ready next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbour Terveysses.
The general issue of miracle is where the new management unit will be sufficient for customers, as many private nurses will now be absent during the wars in Si.
Anne Flink Attendo, the regional director of Hoot Services, has commented that there will be more demand for alternatives and more efficient services in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Mrs Atentendo took care of Cite's private care homes in Knerkov and Eerka.
Trade related to business, but buildings are clearly a five-year temporary contract.
Flink says that Attendo has no acute need to move activities out of these farms.
There is more to be said later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the British factory in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the British Public Trade Union GMB Scottish, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Toxrates factory.
There are more than 500 employees at the Hobnoc and Rotch Tea factory which is producing other products.
Mr McViras' Scottish company told us that he had invested over GBP 5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that the workers and trade unionists will be told 'will certainly be the first to be informed if changes are to be made.
In a letter to the Tehran, GMB calls on the company to 'respond to the concern that no funding has been provided for modernising production lines'.
The fact that the director of the GMBAN trade union, Dover Duff, does not receive any clear information on the needs of the Tollross business and future investment plans, is extremely worrying.
'families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force has focused heavily on the local community and on the Glasgow big city, which is a major source of employment in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, from the point of view of constant reductions in the cost of living and production, the East Glasgow urgently needs successful McVirac production.
According to Mr Pladis's information, the Director-General had only received a letter from the trade union on the last day, and the company is responding directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction between workers and trade union representatives.
"We had regular meetings with the workers and the representatives of the GMB in Tot two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with the workers the fact that, like other companies operating in a very competitive and precarious market, we are constantly evaluating all our business activities and putting our heads in order to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the scientist, over the past few years, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Toxrates factory, in particular its production birds and its activities.
'We are aware of the long history of Toxrates as a production plant and we will certainly be the first to inform workers and trade unionists if we are to make changes to their activities'.
Did PSG Barcelona save three years ago from the transfer of Neymar?
Laga Laiga may lose his interest in Marco was compared.
Paris Saint Germa will not give up the Neymr transfer after he has paid EUR 189 million for the conclusion of the agreement, but will PSG be warned of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the case in the summer, and the French Ligue 1 football team is prepared to break the world record of transfers, which was less than half the same: It was born when Paul Paul returned to Manchester Union with a sum of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymark will be the world's most expensive football and also the best paid professional athletes in the world, as PSG will provide him with more than GBP 500 000 weekly wages after taxes.
It is known that Barcelona is razed by the PSGs' behaviour and the way in which Neymar has left the hook, and the source near Barcelona tells us that the club has been extremely concerned about Neymark since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Three years ago, did the President of the PSGs expect this transfer to take place?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in the Black Malaid in 2014, Nasser All Khmer mer lafi warned the PSG clubs for the best players.
'I am not concerned because they know that if they dream of our players we will become their opponents and we will contact their players', 'Ala Khmer Roulafi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they dream of our players they will have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of precisely this: It expressed its interest in the central players of the PSGs, Marco, earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italy to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its starter Neymar.
