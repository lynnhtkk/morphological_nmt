For Mr Caverón, he wanted to repair his sex, diagnose and now he is doing his art on this subject - 'he should have the right to his own call'.
Dozens of patient reports are scrapped from the disappearance of the autocacademic academic academic, Proorandum.
Each of them reads the name of Cameida.
Paper reveals a multi-annual story about how external people have written their interpretation of the distinction and identity.
He has decided who he is.
'I wanted to tell the person who was the hotel in my country, so that the violence of the process can be visible ', as Mrs Miguer says.
The process refers to the gender repair process.
It is often a period of research lasting years, including meetings with psychology, psychiatric, carers and doctors.
The process is starting near the 'gender disruption' of the 'green diagnosis' study carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Mrs Miguélez, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the atrotrotroika that he was locating via the Internet and, in any case, was very long in his own repair process.
He felt a woman, but under Finnish law someone must go through the repair process so that the gender can also be repaired legally.
Transnational law, in other words the law on the strengthening of the sex of the Scandinavian (563 / 2002) obliges female people to be forced to escape so that the right gender, for example, can be obtained in the register and passport.
At the moment, repairs of each sex are required from psychiatric diagnosis and certificates of reproductive capacity.
It is up to people to decide on their own body.
'There is an intolerable situation and a violation of human rights', say 'More.
In Finland, we have been discussing the reform of Transnational law for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations and the European Court of Justice has a prejudice which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a legal amendment under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huvis.
Elections took place and Peruvian roots in government.
Now, the law is once again being changed.
We are talking about internal political disputes which do not even relate to this law.
'The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law ', says the operator of Amnesty's Finnish department, Frank Johson.
Two major installations are dominated by the front part of the architecture.
One of them consists of packaging and user instructions for medicinal products used by peer.
At the Points Institute, for example, any protagonists can read the distinction between the psychological interpretation of the university hospital in Tampere.
Mr Psychar met Mr Camisón twice and wrote a report that should define the right to care and access to assistance.
The reality of the situation that is being investigated seems to be vulnerable.
The perception of self-examination at border level appears to be fragmented and ironic insecurity is highlighted.
He did not recognise himself from these descriptions.
'it was a shock to hear me diagnosed as a race ', as he says.
It was even more shocking when there was no sexual repair.
According to the Management Board, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
Then, on 11 February 2015, Mrs Territorier went out of the meeting and thrown a peak out of the television sand.
Subsequently, this television was the art of the Monuthanol for the Excluorange, where his experience of power and use of it was revealed by Mrs Miguélez.
'It is absurd that any person who is to be described as a woman can increase his front, but diagnosis needs to be abolished '.
Mr Kehosi is not a person of yours if the homes were no more than the gender definition of born.
Unfortunately, the experience of Mrs Miguélez is not the only one.
The half-way repair process is more punishable for many intellectual reasons than for purely medical operations.
It is going to meet dozens of people who must be justified in their own existence and their right to sex.
'It is absurd that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, calling for their resources not to be sufficient '.
Many people in the process have psychological symptoms: Depression, harassment, potential harassment.
On these grounds, the management staff can stipulate that treatment cannot begin.
'obstruction of treatment and assistance may lead to even worse people than it was before the process begins'.
The self-exhibition of the steer is also concerned with harassment and ideas about suicide.
"I have had self-destructive ideas throughout my time and that is something that people normally find hard to tolerate."
It has been treated with medicines and when Mrs Miguélez started using hormones, it has become easier.
He had at last been able to tell us the feelings that had already existed in the child and in the theoretical age.
Why did the label not appear to be suitable for its own invitation and why the beaches had to be the wheel instead of the equitable coalition?
The most important thing for the researcher is that there are people who see him.
One is a fundamental need.
'We have to justify ourselves so much by talking, stalling, using votes and movements'.
Nowadays, he already feels like seeing him, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, there may be a great deal of support.
The most powerful is the fact that close people are miserable.
'they should know and know who I am, but they do not agree or cannot internalise it ', they will continue.
Not all corporations need physical change, however.
They do not suffer from urban, that is, from slavery, where the body or its parts can cause harassment and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, there can be no official confirmation of their own sex.
'There is no medical justification for these studies'.
And that is true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to the legal sex.
An elderly applicant makes a written application for a new identity identification, saying that he feels he is another sex.
After six months of discretion, the applicant will confirm his application in writing and the Ministry will give the applicant a new personal identification.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this demand is also accompanied by an exhibition of pedestrian.
It has not been a theoretical experience for the artist, it has been a political and artistic test.
I want to believe that art still plays an important role and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The National Legislative Organisation issued a travel warning to Mission.
NAACPP, the American National AACPS, has issued a travel warning on Mission, which is the result of discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
'NAACP travel data on Mission 'will enter into force on 28 and 8.2017, calling for special attention and extreme caution when travelling in a state which has recently experienced a number of questionable racial events'.
The recent law in Missourmas makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination and, furthermore, the application of state law is disproportionately targeted at minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the adoption of a travel warning.
"Human civil rights are being violated.
They are being stopped on the grounds of colour and ill-treatment or killing ', Mr Rod, President of the NAACP Missouri, said to the International City Star.
'We have not heard about so many cases in the same short space of time '.
The travel communication on Mission is the first warning from the organisation concerning the US Länder.
The organisation mentioned, for example, the racist comments made against American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tennessel, who was from Tennesseason, 280s.
Earlier this year, Mrs Sanders died in questionable circumstances; she was driving through the State when her car stopped the fuel; she was arrested by the police in Missouri, even if she was not accused of a crime.
Reference was also made to the report by Mr Missouri's Minister for Justice, according to which the police are stopping 75% of black drivers more likely than white.
The purpose of the communication is to invite people to be alert and warn their families, friends and employees about what can happen in Missourmas'.
"People must prepare, for example, by including money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the State."
According to the FBI, in 2015, hundreds of hatred were recorded, that is to say, the sixth most in the United States.
The warning is also a response to Mr Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies in terms of housing and labour relations.
The ACLULU organisation, which ensures the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizon since they had adopted migratory laws which oblige the police to arrest people for acts of immigration, which, according to the organisation, will increase racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and apply to other countries, but they have recently been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
You: Mr Linkohr asked for a report from Mr Finuoli on the supplementary retirement provision of the supplier.
Mika Linkohr, the Minister for Enterprise, has asked Mr Finuoli to report on the supplementary pension contributions received by the operator of the airline carrier, Pekka Vauramo.
According to the minister, this contradicts the will of the state.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130 000 obtained by Vauramo was raised this week when the Helsinki statements reported on the process of rewarding the managers of the stock exchanges.
Finnish Kuramo wrote a news about Vauramo's supplementary retirement in February.
Mr Finnair said that he will abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has insisted that supplementary pensions will not be used to reward.
More than half of Finland is owned by the state.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the decision on ownership last year.
Sanctions straightened up the speeches immediately.
Not so long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from the village to warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, seemed to be doing a great deal with each other.
Since then, the tunnel has fallen considerably.
The new economic sanctions signed by the US Congress last week and signed by Mr Trumpin on Wednesday were a smooth response in Russia.
The Tyrenees' answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medwater that the Trumpi law means' full trade '.
Even if the Russian reactions were to be defeated only in the form of escalation and excesses of political rhetoric, it is a fact that the relationship between the United States and Russia was exacerbated after a short month of nervousness following the election of Trumpin.
In the United States, the enforcement of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Admittedly, the law was adopted by the Congress with a considerable degree of unanimity, but, as has been said, it was considerably more difficult for the President to adopt the law.
Mr Trump criticised the law that he has just signed as' substantial shortcomings'.
President Trumpin 's irritation may have been attributable in particular to Russia, even though the adoption of a law that restricts its own powers has also had to be repugnant.
As is well known, there is a study in the United States of possible interference by Russia in the presidential elections as well as in the Trumpin campaign on Russia.
The escalation between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of nerve.
Once the staff of the Belarus have changed rigorously and the various scandalous translations have almost revealed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that foreign policy is not being conducted under the leadership of the President of the United States, but by the President.
This situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia is a breakthrough in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only economic sanctions, but also tension in the security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is exacerbating relations.
The EU has taken a prominent view of the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, at least on the head, the interests of the Member States differ greatly.
A Member State such as Finland, which trading a lot with Russia, has been a real obstacle to economic sanctions.
The effects of recent US sanctions are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make life more difficult for many European companies.
In Finland, for example, the effects may be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovo nuclear project.
Happair in Europe has led to the exclusion of sanctions, for example, from LNG, an important liquid natural gas for the American economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating outrage in world politics.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well considered and observed.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacrosanct?
In the White House of Trumpi, we now have the Vapaukup statutes.
Intervention in the Chechens is certainly a sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this just as well as others: Together with the American soldiers, Saddam Hussein's statute in the car of Firduras in 2003 was dropped by the Iraqis.
Stevenen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trumpi regime, knew very well what was going on in the heated debate with the CNN channels Jim Acosta, who was attacked by Mr Miller in his words about the President's proposal to considerably reduce legal immigration.
Mr Miller did not really criticise the statues himself.
If he had done so, he would have obtained enormous sums of money from the organisers of venture cartels and Vapaudenstatues.
He was attacked by his statutes and, in particular, by the fact that, in 1903, Emma Lamzardo was added to his statutes - 17 years after his statutes were completed.
That was what Miller said about Acosur: 'I do not want to go into history now, but the Vapauvenstat is the symbol of American freedom, which is a symbol of the world.
Red Cross was added at a later date and does not belong to the original Vapaukup statute. "
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it is not just a question of history, as he himself said.
What matters are the words of Lazardo, the only quality in which the state invites not only immigrants but 'the poorest': 'Gauge, orthodoxy, / masses of alarmist alert and / The wretensorship of Equal Opportunities'.
Red Cross is now more topical than ever.
Mr Miller did not have any criticism of literature; he made it clear that 'the poorest' are not welcome to the United States of America.
The importance of the dispute in its Vakuven is part of a wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his deaths, the friends of Lazardo campaigned for the sake of deaths, who knew perfectly well that it was a very political act.
In its statutes, the aim was to establish links between French and American republicity by means of a classic symbolic, freedom by female congestion.
Mr Lamzarus changed the significance of this: In his vast majority, the female hammer is no longer abstract, but has a vote.
And it gives itself a new name: The mother of the expelled.
The integration of Red Cross into the image was an enthusiastic feminist coup of power and a disastrous attack on the American nationality ideal.
Mr Lamzarus changed the meaning of his statute and for a long time the right has wanted to change it back to its original status.
In 2010, Mrs Lautala - who can now be described as a sort of projection of Trumpi - said that the statutory statutes would not be allowed to be invited to anyone, but would be the early predecessor of the neo-Conservatives, who would take the United States to the blind eye to the world: 'There will be a stamp in Liberals.
He exports freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
War does not show the way to the United States. "
Very rarely, Mrs Lautalonia was right to some extent.
The importance of its statutes depends entirely from the point of view.
Lazarus has seen it as poor and news but hopeless immigrants from the ship after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking better life.
His statutes are comfortable by giving hope and welcoming.
And that is not what Miller and Trump want at all.
Their wars do not show the way, they do not show the way, they do not go the flames of hatred, their only source of force.
The Mount of Sport 2017: Neil Byrne praises Scottish members of the British landscape.
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when only two scores got into the British landscape.
The British Confederation's Director-General for Sport, Neil Byrne, says that the 16 scoreboard members of the world championship are 'significant confirmation'.
On Friday, a number of sportsmen and sportspeople have been selected at the Mount Mountains in London.
According to Mr Blaco, 'something special is happening in Scotland', which Great Britain must learn from.
'This is welcome and we will continue to investigate it so long that we understand what is at stake ', Mr Bradbouro.
'I spoke to the representatives of the Sport Institute in Scotland and they thought it was related to the work of the institution.
The Scottish Confederation of Sport believes, on the other hand, that it has to do with the functioning of the alliance;
And the Global Sport Organisation in Britain believes that it is based on their actions.
And the usual cabinet is of the opinion that he must have something to do with this.
However, this is something quite remarkable, and that is why it is. "
In London, many sportspeople are seriously competing with the metaphors, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchet, which is competing with Sir Mo Farah, and Eilidh Doyle, for its part, was chosen as the captain of the taste.
'Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His speech was incredibly wonderful ', Mr Byrne'.
'sportsmen and women abandoned the opportunity for their achievements and motivated motives, irrespective of where they happen to live and train.
What Mr Eilidh said was a genuine feeling and passion in sport '.
Eilidh Doyle is a hotel of 400 metres in the axis of the International Community championship, which is his fifth World Cup, who believes that it is' incredible 'that there are 16 scores in the landscape.
The previous record was seven years ago between 1983 and 2015.
Over the past five years, Laura Muir has been drinking from the record in Great Britain and two of Europe.
He is competing in London between 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
In London, Chris O'Hare is travelling around 1 500 metres, and it is worth keeping his eye on him: A man has an excellent season, including profits in the British Munich and Annivorgames.
Mrs Doyle will recall her first World Cup, the only shop in the landscape to add Lord McConnell.
The Mayor's rebellion says that he is' tremendous proud 'that there are so many scores involved, some of which are seriously competing with financial sites and metals.
'Athens access is, in any case, a great honour, but, even more importantly, because the members of the Mayor voted for the captain, Doyle.
'I am, of course, very proud of any scoreboard that got into the landscape.
That shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished sportsmen and women who compete on wages.
What I am talking about?
I think that this was very good.
I focused on how fortunate we are when we have household cats.
It is important to enjoy the support of the domestic public and the fact that we are back on the Olympic Games.
I have another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will become an absurd joy '.
Obstructing critics in Florence: There will be no room for public office if you do not stand up for criticism.
The father of our country knew what is poor publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon started to criticise him for any domestic policy, always in his political principles.
The criticism was certainly irritated;
But he did not silence his critics.
'Washington said in 1783 that if freedom of speech were to be abolished, we could be stupid and silent like sheep being slaughtered '.
That brings us to the Deputy Governor, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
The staff of Hogan have removed at least 450 comments and prevented them from making their official web site.
Earlier this week, the US Civil Rights Association brought Hogan to justice.
His staff consider the challenge to be unjustified, and their attitude was also diminishing on the network.
'What is it, 'of course, only Fbootton, and many of them have said?
But it is important;
In particular, Hogan.
Mr Hogan is an amazingly popular ruler of a state governed by democrats.
Secondly, he has received the best estimates of his activities among 50 Governors.
Mr Hogan is not a delicate reaction to hot air.
He has steadily led the Länder and sticked strictly to the principles.
He has also used Frahm as the main channel for contact with his electorate and published an image of a chicken in chemicals.
It is therefore unnecessary, and even dangerous, to prevent users on the website of the Governor, who is the page of a public and official forum which his staff maintain with tax money.
In his interview with the postal office in Washington, the Hogan Information Socialist, Mr Amelia CF, was defending his actions, who said that it was only a question of the modulation of comments.
It is, however, too easy a solution to marginalise commentators as troika, champagne or hatred.
Washington Paul interviewed users in Hogan's Figboil.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, not troika but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and passers.
They said that their comments were respectable, noticeable and relevant.
The passer quoted the Bible in his remarks; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic religion of Hogan.
The lawyer, Lakhm Sarma Ramani Marywidt Boywidt, was not hostile, but asked a question of hostilities.
'I was curiously disappointed that Mr Hogan had not adopted a position on hatred and other recent news', he wrote Washington Posselt's news in his comments.
'I cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same point, they will be deemed to be a sort of organised force immediately and ignored as a large group of people concerned. '
The staff of the deputy engineer called the comments' a centralised attack ', and someone else could call them an incentive to promote what is considered important.
Even in the era of mine boycott, communications can easily be managed by preventing critics or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical books or arrest and silence demonstrators.
It is only now digital, however.
Hogan is not the first public office to be accused of scrapping Florence and other social media channels.
He has been brought to justice by the Trumpin users.
Last week, a first major decision was taken in Virginia.
According to the judge of Alexandria, James C. C. Cacheriotti, the government of the Loudour City in the United States violated the first amendment to the American Constitution by blocking the electorate in Florence.
And the US Civil Rights Association visited discussions with Matt Bevin, the Kentutututucci Republican Governor, on the use of Twitter and Florence.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had the same effect as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers has risen and anonymous writers have crushed Washington.
Even then there were troikas.
Nimimimericola Juricola, Belarus and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they dream of Washington's decisions.
The President 's office received petitions criticising the Jaya Agreement, that is, the cooperation, trade and shipping agreement between the United States and Great Britain, as demonstrated by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
Birds should be stopped immediately in June.
Samples have come from approximately half of the seats and, furthermore, net reports on the best, three.

The bulldozers have died in the name 'tricososis'.
It is the result of its deliberate name, Mr Trichomonas gallinae.
In the past, it has been known to be black villages, especially in the shortages.
In the twenty-first century, however, the disease was also detected in poultry.
In 2009, the stalling went well.
At the time, the trico-comotive caused the collapse of the Finnish heroin and subsequently the stocks of species have been revitalised.
The sick heroin has now been, but at least not yet on a massive scale, the natural centre of the Helsinki University, Juha Honfish, says.
We are afraid that the previous outbreak of nerve boys will be renewed if something is done.
What needs to be done now is very simple and one that everyone can do: To stop using birds immediately.

Ronan Ramos hopes that it will benefit from the repatriation of Renaissance Club.
The former European superpower Ronan Ramos hopes to benefit from the home home service over the next three days, when the Renaissance Club Eastern-Lothiang in Scotland is organising 25.
Last year, the Northern Ireland Ramos were led by peat in neighbouring Archerelago Linkohr before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales, who is rejoicing and acting as a club's founder and supplier, Jerry Sarvad.
'I followed the construction of Renaissance Club ', and this event will allow it to be completely loyal', as Mr Ramos said.
'players see at their best, and it is in a wonderful condition.
Mrs Jerry has done a wonderful job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador and is proud of his achievements here.
Peat is a wonderful presentation on the ground. "
The English Eales is defending championship for the first time, despite the fact that, in his 322-year career, it has won both the rotating of Europe and the interlocutor cycle in Europe.
'There is a very special opportunity ', the player in Southpork says.
'I was unable to defend my victory at Extremadura Openi, because peat is not part of the recession this year.
It is a great pleasure to return here.
This is a fine place to play golf.
The memory of last year remembered: The victory of cod was a wonderful one for me and my wife, Mr Sharon.
It was a fine time, which we will always remember. "
Mr Orden is returning to his own territory, who, after 50 years of recycling, left the recycling.

The potential internal problems of irrigation were sorted out in the village.
In the village of Porin Brigades, at least for the time being, there have been no internal problems, and the priktat was reported on Thursday.
Research into aviation is continuing.
The reports began when a man who suspended his shipping service for health thought that his health had been weakened because of a poor internal environment.
According to Mika Holman, there are no problems in the health situation of other men.
It became apparent that this was an isolated case and that there have been no health problems for other firemen in it.
Every notification is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in depth.
At the moment, we do not know that we have any internal air problem, Mr Holma says.
The prime minister's report says that, due to the arrival of July, the army has had to transfer goods, which has led to an increase in pollination for a moment.
The air has therefore been able to appear emotional, Mr Holmami says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia
Bardina Deggen is not using heat in the food installation.
He is only rarely using him.
Degali is not living in the wood building in Enarotals, in the capital of the Paniai region, which is located in the unrest of Indonesia in Papua, and when he produces a day-to-day, he normally puts baby - local 'notes' - straight to its income.
In half an hour 's time, a babathtail returned to the carcinogenic, unwashed, eating.
There are no honeys in Degel's homes, and he is sitting on other paints in which he normally also treats his daily archives, such as the search for laundering in seed waters.
The flow of the globe is delivered by an irreparable mammmoth.
Mrs Deggen is not the youngest of four of her young men, and she has not been ordered to deal with the fears.
Pluralism is common here.
Late work may be dangerous: The majority of people in the village are unemployed and many drink, and the soldiers must be taken into account.
"Nobody dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Deggen says.
This is a rare breakthrough in Papua, in the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, and was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1 026 Western prisoners were forced to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The Dutch National Independence Movement quickly turned a blind eye to the government of Jakarta, which keeps the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering there.
In 2003, the installation was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua, the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua-New Guinea.
Enarotala is a peripheral and trip, where a flight from the capital of Jayau to the capital of the installation of Jayau, starts with five-hour driving hours in the car.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of around 19 000 inhabitants there are wood farms surrounded by Bambambak plants whose waves of freezers have rushed into ceilings.
Few indicators have visited us here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrive, the Papuan Mu Paul will be returned to Uga Tamee.
Other changes have also been made.
'We did not have such clothes', Mr Deggen does not say: He means a colourless, died battle price, a wreck and a church of his own.
'We only had the newspapers in front of our houses'.
Papua is the poorest country in Indonesia, where 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the background to Indonesia.
The Paniai is about a New Jersey-collaborated host with 153 000 inhabitants; only about 100 km away from Paniana is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable shipping company, owned by the ex McMoran company, whose place of residence is Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine imported USD 3.1 billion from the value of the pedestrian.
In addition, Papua has a reserve of USD 78 billion.
For the Papuans, however, these wealth is a misery, because it means the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, New York Transatsos revealed that, between 1998 and 2004, the Embassy paid nearly USD 20 million to local military personnel and the army's local units, and that the individual officers were paid as much as USD 150 000.
Papua 's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, which is uncertain.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 refugees and rape, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the tribes of Papua in the 1970s brought about genocide.
Last year, more than 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
In the report by the Archbishop Prize of Brisbishop of 2016, there are reports of atrocities in the last year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electricity attacks are particularly popular - and unruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
It is difficult to reduce the number of victims because there are cases every week, Andreas Harson, an Indonesian scientist from the Association of Tempus Watch.
Congestion has been tightened up when natural resources in Papua attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants, I inserted 83% of the Christians, but the demographic structure is changing, as the violent Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatro and Sulawesi change to the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Minerals sell chicken chicken and gadop-gadop in the planet.
It is difficult for people to compete at local level.
'My players have begun to sell channels and hatred on the rhetoric at lower cost than local ', tell Abeth You, a 24-year-old man, from Paniana and have changed to the capital of an installation.
"Local women lost their clients."
Either the President of Indonesia, Mr Widodo - by his lunch of Jokowi - promised to address the injustice and human rights abuses in Papua in 2014.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former puzzle won the vote in 27 regions, including in Paniana, to travel to Jakarta as President.
But little has changed in Papua and the local people feel disguised.
"Our hearts were irritated because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to live up to our wishes and restore justice," You says.
There were only two months after Jokowi's officials in October.
Eleven children were statuting on Christmas platform in Enarotala from 7 to 12 December 2014, when two provincial soldiers appeared on motorcycles.
Children who were afraid said to soldiers that they should use driving baggage.
One of the soldiers was not reported; according to the local passport, Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, children were caught and mistreated by soldiers who were drinking from the battle.
In this way, one soldier shooted children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was denied their homes as a result of ill-treatment.
A couple of hours later, the building of the state electoral council was deployed and the following day began.
Approximately a thousand Pope - young men and women and children - met at football matches to demand justice.
They had hunts for celebrations and they started to present the traditional window of the Papuan Mare Prince, where the tanker is swimming and trampling on the holiday.
Some of the demonstrators started to stoning the building of the police and the army.
When the tunnel was heard, the soldiers got the impression in the internal radio system: 'If human resistance were to be resisted more than three times, then they would be dead', based on the official document from the TIMEF, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, Kego Koo, the head of population, wondered that the situation would be deprived of and asked for violence to return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen again.
"When I turned around, I was shocked to the Left," he told the TIMEE newspaper that he was the church of his paralysed wood.
We still do not know who was shooting him, but we had faith in the ranks of the soldiers.
A number of platforms were shot in the Venice Tunnel. "
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his group saw the ammunition.
'I went to him and ensured that he was indeed ', told the newspaper, Yohanes TIME, who, like many indicators, only uses one name.
'It was he who died... '
Mr Yoje Mende, the police supervisor of Papua, told the journalists that the police only 'protected' police status because it was the target of an attack.
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us', the Papuan police officer, Pudan Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
'It is about life and death '.
According to the Association of Paul Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The day after Jakarta was killed.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an emotional speech in Jayau in which he expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims and promised that violence in Papua would be tackled.
'I want the case to be looked into immediately, so that it never happens again '.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Mr Wiranto, said that he would launch investigations of human rights abuses outside the legal system.
However, he started to withdraw his speeches straight away.
'the majority of offences occurred a long time ago;
The 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Most importantly, we have chosen to investigate infringements, but, as he said, certain processes are needed. "
In an interview with the TIMEE newspaper in Jakarta between 5 and 6.2017, Mr Wiranto said that he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be looked at in court", he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of 'crimes against humanity', which relate to the death of more than a thousand people during the bloody vote on Austria-Timor in 1999, when Wiranto told the TIMEMEF that eleven cases have already been investigated, including the events in Papua.
The families of the victims of Paniai are bleak about the claims.
'I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way ', Mr Yohanes says.
'I have already tired of this'.
He says that he is still afraid, even though it has been going on for years.
"Yes, I am afraid", he says.
'I fear that the army will arrest me, and I am afraid I will be shot '.
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the panic does not dare to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had mistreated him when he had helped to threaten four victims.
'soldiers are looking to me after the victim ', he says.
The fires have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired the villages in the neighbouring region of Paniai in Deiyak.
One death and 17 injuries were injured by the conflict between the leader of the village and construction company, which started when the leader refused to take the man who lost his way to hospital, including children.
A hospital man was 224 years old, Ravianus Douw, who had to fish on a close river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The enthusiastic villages showed their minds before the company's office.
According to the police, the villages stoned the police who responded with warning stonings.
According to the local authorities, however, the mobile police unit in Indonesia opened up a force of violence and killed one village.
'We are horrified, 'Dominggu Badii, a 29th-year-old Dominggu Badii, who is close to hospital and who saw when vulnerable were imported into treatment.
'I have been hiding at home for two days'.
Parliament in Deiyayas has called for soldiers who have shot the platforms to be held liable and for a police unit to be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development is a source of dissatisfaction in the Meeting, Monti, Danies and Damallah tribes, who live in the Papua wheat in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Freedom movement in Papua (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Pope with occasional attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are in Paniana, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has replied to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniana in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of those arrested will never return.
Paniai is known as' sad, forgotten '.
Poverty is a source of dissatisfaction.
In Enarotals, there are few rice to sell, and that too is too expensive for local people;
As is the case.
People grow their food themselves: Mainly bathers and some fruit and journalists.
Farming is a job for women and one woman can have four or five bathers.
Most of the hundreds are families and the rest is sold on the town.
Ten bathers cost only 10 000 rumours (75 cents).
In time, the differences in the livelihoods of local and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabiren airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few priests have enough capital and knowledge to plunder their own businesses in a competitive manner.
"Young people do not want to stay in their villages because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the tribunal council.
The remote Papua in the world is being ignored.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international news are still tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Franck Eumudie and Baside Long Kong, were expelled from Papua, even though they had been given a rare description permit, formally because of the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Deputy Watch Deputy Director of Asia, Phelim King, Jokowi has not kept his electoral packages; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by lifting restrictions on news.
'The most unrest in the east of Indonesia with regard to Papua and Western Papua, journalists have new risks: Refusal of visas and black lists', as he said in his statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government will only exert pressure on the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, six states in the Pacific - Tonga, laughter, Palau, Stockvals, Marshall and Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'numerous and widespread infringements' of Papua, including the Paniai amputation.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papua liberation movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Arrmanatha Nasir, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that 'Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights violations'.
Local governments want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by Kees Van bar, visited Jayau on 4 and 5.2017, the local authorities violated silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reveal the anonymous source of staying.
There are 2019 presidential elections in Indonesia, but the Pope says that there is no longer any likelihood of voting on Jokowi.
'Yokowi is a good thing, but there are people around him who have been confused with the Paniai amputation, 'he says, Mr Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to be aware of the situation in Spain: They live under the greedy and unpredictable army in lack of power and poverty, virtually no health service and no education opportunities.
According to Mr Gobin, the panic, like the other Pope, considers the votes that he has given to Jokowi to be a 'debt', which must be repaid.
"They do not want money; they only want justice", he says.
In spite of the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai amputation once again demonstrated their resistance in symbolic terms: They threatened one of the victims to a police station and to an anti-military country.
They know that there may never be justice, but at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"My fellow Member was killed," Yacobus says the weight.
'What else could we do? '
Dereck Chisora haunted by the cancellation of the Robert Helsinki fantasy: 'Even his own fans do not want to see'.
On 27 May, the Robert Helsinki and Dereck Chisoran were to be included in the Hartwaller Islands.
However, the match withdrew for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora is crushing the blame for the fresh breakdown in Helsinki.
I fought in Finland, but that was not my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell flags there.
The reason was my opponent in Finland.
Even his fanaticism does not want to see him drink because he is appalling, Chisora daughters.
For the first time, Helsinki and Chisora met in a complete Hartwaller in December 2011.
Helsinki won the match with a controversial tribunal.
The flag sales of bonemeal went hard, and its protagonist, Nisse Sauerospeaker, told Il in May that the match was transferred to the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
However, withdrawal is no longer rare Chisora.
In fact, it would probably have had to be withdrawn after Chisora's disease.
On Thursday, three days before the match date, I raised hard disputes.
Tyrne was explosive.
In the hospital, it was said that I must be cut, Mr Chisora says.
At the moment, the United Kingdom says that it is in the order of around 45%.
He is not interested in revitalisation with Helsinki, but in the direction of Dillia Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat in December.
The Torchy pilot, Dubak, has come to light again.
On Friday, the housing in Dubai, which was one of the highest in the world, was overwhelmed by the villages, and hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee 337 metres of high 790s.
This was the second fire in two years' time in a building called Torch.
The building was defeated and nobody knows that it was injured, for the reason of the fire there was no idea at all immediately after the event.
'We were sleep and woke up the fire-fighters and people 's shoulders.
On the 50th floor, which took ten minutes', 'George-name', we told Reuter.
According to the Dubain rescue authorities, the exhaustion forces were wrecked four hundred days this morning and left the building.
The government has announced that it is organising the housing for those leaving their homes.
The incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used in high buildings in various parts of the world.
After the fire in 2015, the management board of the Torcho building commissioned a study which explained that the most damaged damage is the spread of the wealth of blood and isolation.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the spread of Grenfelfelfell Tower's isolation and vertebral column in London could contribute to speeding up the swift pace of meat in fire where 80 people died in June.
A mopo was stored from an oral park during the night.
Between 21 a.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday, a mopo was stored from an oral park.
Mr Mopo disappeared from the Nokamine risk to Tikkayee 2.
Mopo was Sky Team Monitoring.
It is flawed and registration is 27.REV.
Mopo was later found on Thursday.
The police are asking for findings on mophobic or installation in the e-mail address, Täs e-mail address has been protected from spambosis.
The TVIs Javos and the telephone at the police update of the figure of 0295 415 to 320.
The revised 3.8.2017 a.40 a.m.: The police informed us that the mopo has been found.
In the United States, more than 20% of airline passengers include banned objects are revealing questionnaires.
A survey to air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unaware of the banned objects had passed on the inspection points of the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA); at least 6% of passengers had veterinary or other products that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said that they were only afterwards aware that they had transported weapons, ammunition or explosives in mistake.
The answer to this question was more than a thousand passengers, which was carried out by Stratos Jet Charles, and the results reveal that young passengers are more likely to sacrifice the rules than others.
The TSA rules in 19.7% of passengers who deliberately violate the rules were representatives of the Joint generation and less than 15% belonged to the XV generation.
More generally, the rules were violated by exporting food and liquid to aircraft.
More than 3% of their exports consciously admitted that they are exported to the aeroplane, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men deliberately told us that they were exporting banned medicines to the aeroplane.
There were passengers from all over the United States, and the company that carried out this questionnaire wanted to see how many had exported smugglers in injury and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelling passengers are also most likely to export the safety inspection - deliberately or unknown.
However, as the questionnaire has said, the TSA guidelines are very complicated and confused.
Often, passengers do not know what liquid tickets can be exported and how many.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the majority of those who confiscate TSA are liquid.
For some time there was also the belief that books should not be exported to the aircraft.
Barriers must be taken to flights at home, but not international flights.
The Director-General of the US Environment Agency, Mr Pruitt, wheeled his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama to reduce emissions.
The day after the fifteen Länder 's Director-General of the EPA, Mr Pruitt, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions that reduce emissions under Obama' s administration.
According to Mr Pruitt, this change shows that his agency will take more account of the needs of decision-makers in the Member States in environmental matters than before.
Mr Pruitt did not say a word about the position taken against his previous decision in the Federal Petitions Court.
The States should begin to comply with the deadline for ozone in 2015 as from 1 January 10.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of decisions by one year, so that his office will have more time to study the plan, because 'the agency does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth'.
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Okald, before President Donald Trump was appointed President of the EPA, who is known to be opposed to stricter environmental rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change in demonstration on Wednesday is the last setback to the Pruiti plan to relax the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Petitions Court in Washington adopted a decision stating that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce metals.
In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mr Pruitt claimed that his translation of the ozone rules would only strengthen EPA cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at fulfilling new requirements within the timeframe.
"During previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for the right of activists and others to reach agreement on timetables", as Mr Pruitt said in his last intervention to challenge the Environment Agency more than ten times.
'We do not believe in regulation through trial and take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation on our action seriously and the powers that it gives us. "
However, it was stated in the opinion of the EPA that Pruitt can continue to exercise its' powers' to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers' to ensure that the provisions' are justified and based on the best available information '.
In Congress, republicans are pushing for a wider change in the ozone rules.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of decisions in 2015 for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
This week, the EPA, the General Prosecutor of the New York State, led by Eric Schneider, stated that this group intends to continue to exert pressure.
'EPA change in demonstration as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for the 6.7 million American and more than 115 million American citizens exposed to the direct effects of smoking in their communities', as Mr Schneider said.
In addition to New York, California, Connectict, Delegation, Illinois, Iowa, reputation, reputation, reputation, Massachetts, Mexeso, Orego, Pennsylvania, Rhode Isberg, Vermont, Washington and Disput of Colombia.
The ozone in the earth is born when emissions from cars, power stations, oil refineries and chemicals plants, for example, react in the atmosphere to sunshine light.
The smoking resulting from this can cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups, as well as for thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors rejoiced at the surprising change in direction in Pruiti.
'It is worrying to see how much pressure was required to make the corresponding glass of common sense ', Lori Ann Ann Burd's Biological Diversities Centre.
'We must continue to fight the Trumper regime because its ideological objective is to act on the conditions of polluters and other groups who are pursuing their own interests'.
The automobile manufacturer will come from the street - 'it will take place at the Ferrari daughter'.
It also intends to invest in sports cars while at the same time trying to maintain its extra-cutting position.
This is probably the case, but it is happening at the Ferrari dark, the Director-General of Sergio Marchionne said that the plans were planned for Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian super-car manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, with the notification of verification Nepws.
All Eastern Savo-Savo expulsion cases are the same type of virus.
The Rantastic cargo infection is the same type of virus as previous incidents in Eastern Savo, to inform THL.
On Thursday, the laboratory of the Health and prosperity Institute has ensured that the fifth waste infection in Eastern Savo is in line with previous infections.
THL has ensured that infection, which was ensured on Friday 28 July, is the same type of virus as in previous cases of Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections found in the Austrian Sahara relate to the first waste in the region in June.
This is a good news, because it means that we do not have any other types of catastrophe.
However, it is possible that the fifth remaining infectious new infections can be brought up until the end of August, and the epidemic is not yet over, the Soster Disease Disease Director, Mirkfish Erkjail, says.
There have been no new catastrophic infections or suspicions since the fifth guaranteed case.
It is still important, however, that everyone ensures that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date, as the Erkhope reminds us.
Subject: Three new shipwreck infections were ensured in Piranda - 'additional infection or epidemic'.
Finland is preparing to do an authorised kilogram.
The revenue of the Pontika was not even considered to be legal.
The reason for this is that the process, along with wine, produces meal which is toxic.
Manufacture at home is legal next year, but it is not even envisaged that the sponsorship should be legalised.
Chicken is manufactured by means of a code of conduct, by a spontaneous resort.
The reason why the TIslam regulation is regulated is that the process, along with wine, produces meal, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to impose a vigorous invention into every man's right, a government advisory Ismo from the Ministry of Social and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of alcohol, it was not thought that the sponsorship would be legalised.
Nor is it on the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of Islam, and Mr Outin Mällem says.
He is in the negotiating portfolios of government parties who took a stand on alcohol reform.
Even the application cannot be granted at home to Islam at home.
Commercial manufacture will also remain authorised.
Condemnation says that the domestic production of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: Alcohol can be manufactured at home by means of a code of conduct.
This means that, in addition to beer, pigs and wine, there can now be legal competition at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law abolishes the requirements for mathematics and aromatic substances and makes it possible for a kilogram to be manufactured, to be made more precise.
Manufacturing must still be carried out in such a way that raw materials or aromic substances produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable.
Under the new law, drinks can manufacture themselves as much as they like, and alcohol from self-employed works can be given a gift.
It must not be allowed to continue to be sale.
In Finland, you no longer have a public health problem, bring faith.
A much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other alpine countries were liberalised.
75% of alcohol in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
As soon as September starts, Alparolic law will be brought before the parliamentary assembly.
The plenary sitting is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House had already adopted a position, but we welcome it.
Oversear Pistorius was accused of being armed in hospital by armed guards.
Oaedo Pistorius, who suffered from incitement, was stoned into the South African hospital because of suspicion of heart.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oversear Pistorius is suffering from prison sentences in prison in Atteridgeil.
According to the British newspaper Mirrora, Mr Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Mr Pistorius suffered from a parallel, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison information officer confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital.
The author of the family of Pistorius said that the former high-level sportsperson was in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the murder of his gold friend, Revan Stenstri, a six-fold paralyse paralyse in prison for six years.
In February 2013, Pistorius shot Sthria.
Telephone conversations reveal Trumpin's pressurising pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
The telephone conversations between the American President Donald Trumpi and Mexico and Australian leaders have left Washington's postal service.
During the telephone debate on 27 January 2017, Trump invited the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Niñaca, to stop his public speeches about not paying the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States suffocated the publicity of the wall project, 'Trumump'.
Mr Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The first telephone from Trumpin to the Australian Prime Minister, Malm Turnbrad, was also published by Washington Prington, during which there was a fierce exchange of words.
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnblin that the agreement whereby the United States would include refugees on their way to Australia is' ridiculous', 'badly' and 'stupid'.
Mr Trump stopped the telephone by saying to Mr Turnbelli that 'this was the most unpleasant telephone of all day'.
Georgia's massacre: The activists restored the right to racist lynch in the hope of the right to hope.
The 'Ford Mergy' car overlooks a number of violence in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues to travel towards a small Moore 's Ford.
There are four black passengers and white drivers in the car; four armed men supported the way before the car went there.
The leader of a group, a middle-aged man who has fallen into the line, takes a profound look at his swine fever and goes through the wind.
Passengers are afraid.
'Roger, nonsense '!
'That out! '
Silence is a violation of silence when a young black man is withdrawn from the front seat.
Fortunately, this appalling incident is merely a resistance, which was presented on 22 and 7.2017.
However, the collapse of the shock is real when the horror of terror is disappeared from the 'Roger'.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore 'Ford to the brink of the events of 1946, at which time Ku Klux Klynan swept two black couples, Roger and Dorograde Mali and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
Nobody has been accused of murdering.
'It is astonishing that nobody has been arrested over these years - even though murderers live amongst us and many have to know who they are ',' Tyrone Brook, who will help restructure the resistance.
'it is a disgrace in history, but, above all, it is a burden that presses our soul '.
Mr Brok is 71 years old and former Georgia Congress.
His resistance is a scandalous invitation to action, and it also reminds the people of Monrom that injustice has never been corrected.
'We want the guilty parties to be brought to justice; we want things to be concluded at last, and we want to recover from sadness and bring about reconciliation, but, above all, we want justice ', Mr Brook.
'We cannot recover and reconcile before we get justice '.
The academic scientist conceals the bodies of the victim who died in the massacre of Georgia from 27 to 1946.
According to the FBI documents, more than 50 men were suspected of cynicism in Monros and surrounding it.
But nobody was accused of murder.
Although the guilty has been free for decades, according to the activists, the motives of the lynchy have always been known to the local people: Politics and so on.
In 1946, the black people in Georgia had the right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, which was adopted by the Supreme Court in April and elections took place in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident in the run-up to the elections in which a black farmer Roger Malcom black the white land owner, Barnet Hester, in the bulldozer, apparently in Malta's wife at Dorothya.
According to Mr Brook, the city was ashamed that Hester had a relationship with Dorothe and that Dorogant was awaiting this child.
According to FBI data, an influential white landscape, Loy Harris, paid USD 25.7.1946 for guarantees of USD 600 against which he was released.
On their own journey, Mae Murray and George Dorothy were followed by their group.
The violence stopped their car before Moore 's Ford.
'The Harrison statistics and organising assassinations', the FBI report states.
"It is also clear that there was a secrecy between the state and the local authorities, who were involved in the murder and destroyed the evidence rather than revealing the personality of the witnesses."
Mr Brok has made this point more concise.
'it was a murder of voting rights', he says.
'they were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that they will do the same if they are going to vote '.
For almost a decade, Mr Cassandra 's resistance to the massacre in Georgia has been directed.
It is an extremely realistic and imprisoned proposal, a description of the appalling racism which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States.
It is difficult to look at the proposal, but it is even more difficult not to see what the intentions are.
'We do not want to talk about a lynchy, because we would also have to face our own dark side '.
'but I cannot create a relationship with you if you do not hear me or do not want to hear what I have experienced. '
The exercise of this year's proposal began in June and, on the first day, approximately 30 actors - dozens of black and paradoxical white - met to listen to a rushed summary of the draft.
Web Marbaulleno is the assistant of a peer.
He has been replacing the local Ku Klux Kluul leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and repugnant.
'That is going to be dirty because I am not myself ', Marbautals says.
'It is important, however, that this aspect of history is also kept on the table, so that it never happens again '.
On the other side of his reciprocal words, Docus Bradbourw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnet Hester.
The proposal starts at a time when Malcom is shouting and working with Mr Hester, who is anxious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothu.
'You have heard 'I said that my country,' nitrates', has been removed!
Mr Rascona, or Mr Hester, will reply.
Then there is the wool.
And then everyone (at least all black players) will dismantle their laurels.
It will be the hardest thing to laugh.
'What! '
He is ashamed.
"He asks for too little."
'ah, there is no point in throwing '.
'I simply do not believe that the whites used the word nitrates at the time. '
So ', another black player confirms.
'There is slander and you must use the longer version '.
The subject of the proposal is unpleasant, but a disgraceful power.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the proposal; they want to respect the memory of those who have died.
It is starting from the outset.
Now Mr Rascona 's words were forceful.
Nobody is laughing.
A rapid and violent end to the resistance.
Apologies, placards and silence.
A woman falling into a black baby marriage marks off the bodies and La Billie Holidayn Strange Fruit.
His voice is irritated in every other word.
At the end of a few ten metres, five hundred and ten watchmen squeezed their eyes and tears.
Almost half the public is black and half white.
One of them is a parity which has come from Ithaca in New York, but most are local.
They have visited the casualties of the victims with Mr Brook, under pressure from Georgia.
The murders have become a reality of the story, and the tunnel on the ground is heavy.
After the Laulus proposal, there is no doubt that there will be a force to check the bodies.
Children are flourishing to look at the theatre and the unmobile bodies and swimming each other.
"They have not really died", a small boy muzzles like reminding himself.
In a few minutes' time, we will have to thank the public.
The players who have put forward the cynicians are depriving themselves of their signs and sacrosanct the tears.
Mr Marbaughter, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona is cheating two actors and then breaking out after the cynical beaches.
"No" to harassment, the woman involved in the proposal is comfortable.
'We know that he is not.
You are doing so for good reasons'.
Later on, the public and the actors will meet for a common evening.
The White Partido from Altanta is heavily debating the proposal with the black partner that they have just met.
It is difficult for Mr Duplinsk to find words when he describes the feelings aroused by the proposal.
'It is difficult to listen to the absurd words and to look at the atrocities that they say and do people who seem to be doing the same thing as yours - precisely because they appear to be the same as you. '
"I found that cynicism continues to take place", he added, "they are only called arrests."
On the other side of the wool, Mr Brook recalls the development of civil liberties for the listens sitting on the same table.
He says that he has already begun planning next year's proposal.
"A resistance is a powerful experience, because it reflects the horrors of our experience, but it is also teaching experience", as Mr Brook says.
'The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeating it '.
Removing the 'extra' sections of the plant in the streets is a spur: The correct saving of this amount is being made.
Is it permissible to divide the dirty newspapers even before we weigh up?
What about the anchor - how much weight, of course?
The answers are very divided: For one it demonstrates the humour of the most extreme, others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that do not use and which, however, go home to squeeze.
The phenomenon is identified in the absence.
For example, there are sheep boxes from the Helsinki-City DG, for example, because many pieces of livestock shops were dismissed.
The newspapers are taken out of the market in biowaste.
According to the news published by Taloussans, the shopkeepers are wondering about nonsense in the vegetables.
But how much will it actually save money before we weigh up the extra parts of the vegetables?
How important is the nitrogen-box industry really about?
We Women tested how much the price will change when anchor, laxarchitecture, delicacy, parallel and flowers take the newspapers or positions away.
Cutting-edge: EUR 2.10 was the price of a flowers paying EUR 1.80 when all the newspapers were deprived of it.
Ananas: The cost of a whole anchor of EUR 2.30 has fallen to EUR 1.95 when its position was withdrawn.
Latvia: EUR 2.60 prices became EUR 2.40 when the short-term position disappeared.
Mr Herkkkkhope: In total, two sensitive areas cost 75 cents.
Without stock, 60 cents have come at a price.
Parsaya: The medium-sized coal cost EUR 1 and 80 cents without stock.
The end result is that if cows and chickens leave, at best save a few dozens of cents in the case of one anger.
In percentage, the price of exports fell by up to 20%.

Mr Neymar, a five-year agreement with the French football corps as a football star, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that representatives of Nepal had paid a football price for the FC Barcelona expansion of EUR 222 million in the Spanish flag.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest transfer in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester Unitedy, which cost EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
Earlier on Thursday, Spain's flag blocked the transfer when it rejected the first attempt at payment by representatives of Nepal.
Under the rules of the Angean, a buying club cannot pay the exchanges price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out of his contracts, which will happen by recycling the money via the supermarket.
In practice, PSG has paid a sum to Nepal and to this representative who provided money through the Anti-Fraud to Barcelona.
Nepal is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be presented to the new home public at the opening of the PSGO period against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA will examine the details.
Furthermore, in its communication, they told Uefe that they will provide information on the payment of the European Football League, so that the Union can determine the disciplinary measures that might arise in this case.
The President of Spain, Javier Tebas, among others, has suspected the PSGO's infringement of the rules of UEFA's financial fair play.
UEFA can punish the loss of over EUR 30 million over three years.
According to UEFA, the transfer of Nepal does not automatically violate its economic doctrine.
The transfer of Nepal to PSGM will have an impact on the economy for many years, but the impact cannot be assessed beforehand.
For example, a large number of players may be sold by means of substantial sums, UESG was informed.
The state-owned state-owned PSG, Qatar Standards, is owned by the PSG.
The club chairs the former doctrine profession, the shadow Nasser-Khelaifi.

Australia, 21, had more fire-fired strikes - the leisure was stored in the safe sea at airports.
Australia Dunn was working with a couple of working taxes at the International Florida airport when, suddenly, a sacred machine suddenly sought from a clean sky.
The force of secrecy thrown it into the country of Dunn, which is close to the pigs.
Dunn was urged to hospital.
He had fire injuries across the board.
My father went to me and said that the debt was evaporated and is in hospital.
I asked whether he is alive, whether Aumn would say so.
Australia spent two weeks in a patient.
In addition to firebreaks, he had damage to meat and brain drain.
Experience for the family as a whole was a tough experience.
That cannot be expected.
It is traumatic for everyone, Anny tells us.
According to the representative of the airport, even at the time of the case, the secret warning system was at the end of the case and the haulier is deciding whether or not to comply with it.
Mr Pearson is reducing 3 000 jobs and revitalising business by cutting back on business.
On Friday, the British training group, Mr Pearson, announced that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and reduce his share by 72%, in response to the pressure on his business.
According to John Fallon, employment reductions are mainly due to be made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, which already reduced 4 000 jobs in the previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by EUR 300 million in May as part of his third savings programme to revitalise the business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Mr Pearson decided to sell his contribution from the Penguin Ranondo to his partners in Bertelsmann, who told us that it would keep its prospects in the first half of this year, which increased by GBP 2.05 billion.
The attack in Kabul: NATO soldiers died in a suicide bombers.
In Kabul, the suicide bombers were attacked by the Afghan capital, who, according to the authorities, were killed by NATO soldiers and many others injured.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Kabul Qabul region.
On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in the mosques in Herat.
On Monday, two people died at the suicide bombers in Kabul.
NATO said that Thursday evening's explosion occurred when the joint vigilance of NATO and the Afghan army was' attacked by an explosive equipment '.
It was reported that all those injured were stable and were treated at Bagram airport in the United States.
According to the exchanges, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qabaghi are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 62 civilians were killed in the first half of 2017, 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed in suicide bombers in Kabul, where there are mainly Chechen Muslims.
The Taliban declared itself to be the victim of the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the centre of Kabul in a bomb attack which was the most devastating attack on the country since the Taliban was plundered by US-led troops in 2001.
The violence highlights the destabilising situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the exchanges, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also greatly weakened people 's confidence in government, in its policy, and in particular in President Ashraf Ghang.
The EPA is plundering its decision to postpone the implementation of smoking rules.
The US Environment Protection Agency denied its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under the Obama Administration on a day after 15 states had challenged the Agency's court.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called 'ozone measurements' in 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
'We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the Länder ', as Mr Pruitt said in his opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone criteria by one year for October 2018, which measuring the level of exhaustion in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency brought before the courts 15 States, mainly governed by democrats, including Disput of Colombia, who said that postponing the implementation was illegal.
President Trumpin's regime has sought ways of mitigating the early environmental provisions of Barack Obama, which, according to Trumpin, is part of a wider programme for economic growth.
The Trum measures have opposed democrats and environmental protectors, who are concerned about the health consequences of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA websites, 'cleaning up without ozone' may weaken the life of pets and increase respiratory symptoms', such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the Ivi leader had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be exported to the aeroplane on 15 July, but the company suspended before the safety inspection.
The police do not specify more precisely why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic stock-leaving machine and put it into public place, such as public transport.
The Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner, Michael Phelan, said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever in Australia.
Four men were caught in police raid on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One man has been released, but his hearings will also continue.
Neses supplier: Renewable fuels were well covered by renewable fuels.
The result of the oil processor, Mr Neses, was before taxes were reduced, but the forecasts were found in the second quarter of the year.
According to the Director-General, Mati Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales quantities of renewable products rose for record record record purposes and the mobilisation of the Services segment was a step in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Crete tax.
According to Lithuania, the profit of renewable products was maintained this year at a good level thanks to higher sales levels and more favourable markets, even though tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is making good progress.
We will continue to concentrate on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investment we have already announced in 2017, as Mr Lievon said in the communication.
Ms Garcia and Valel Lomatzo are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
On Thursday, for the first time, Vell Lomatte and Messy Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting crossroads of 6.7.7 kilos, met on Thursday.
Men were in their own offices of the ESPNN channel in Los Angeles until the unwinned champion of the WBC went to welcome the mestery of Lomatzia, the WBO.
On Saturday, Mr Garcia won the unanimous decision of the former four weights of the World Cup, Avile Broner, and since then Mr Garca and Mr Lomatzenko have been among the five best lists on the comparison of different weights.
Mr Garcia took his right hand and asked: 'How will it go?
Good luck! '
On Saturday, seven ESPNN channels are being defended by Mr Miguel Marriaga.
When the two wooden resigned to photographers, Mrs Klimas pointed out that the gulf between men and women was' complete '.
'I am a former hushkits', Mr Garcia reminded us.
'I move over the SARS 'to Broner, but I am not so big.
I am small in 6.5 kilos.
I want to return to the light.
He must rise to the light line [61.2 kg) and then we can take action.
That is what we are hoping for.
They will meet their wishes'.
Mr Chechenko was in agreement.
'Towards need this match '.
Mr Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on the basis of payment appropriations, which is part of his strategy for Lomatzkov, according to which Lomatzio was going to cope in the light arena later this year and next summer to take over Garcia (370, 30 daughter profit), which would also be interested to target Jorge Linares and Luke Campbellop in Forum 3 September.
'We could be on the side of payment because the fanatics have asked for it ', Mrs Garcia said and then declared that they were prepared to take on a channel which offers the best remuneration package.
'We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else draws the same attention.
As soon as agreement is reached... "
Mr Garcia said that he appreciated Lomatta as an incredible charterer and that he would perhaps go to see Saturday's match.
Mr President, Mr García-Tsatsos interrupted his web of Garcia and said that this three-class mesh from Riversa seemed to be very slow.
Mr Garcia said that he was concentrating first on the demonstration of force and then on the clothing.
Men said that they want to see the match become ever stronger.
'This is the match that is expected.
No other form of form gives less attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this dilemma, Mr Garcia said.
He said that he had waited for the best, 'My is legitimate.
It will be a fine remark '.
The average wage of EUR 5 300, education - the situation of investment advisers was' wild and free '.
A great deal has been said recently about the quality of the advice.
Last time, the Helsinki statements told us about Ritta, 68, to which the bank professor spoke in full when selling investment products.
At the beginning of next year, the rules governing investment advisers and the sale of different investment products will be tightened up.
Tightening up is based on the new financial market directive, which will be applied at the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisers and those who sell investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
There are no qualifications requirements in the law.
The Financial Services (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service should carry out their own APV1 or APV2 inquiry.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications under the name 'APVs', whose team of inquiry includes experts from financial control (Fiori), universities and some of the industry.
The qualifications are a reference point of 12 to 15, and their tenders draw up a wave for the development of the EE, that is to say, a wave for the development of management services.
It is said on its net website that, generally speaking, both tens are 'very broad when it comes to requirements'.
There are 1015 books of qualifications, as well as a number of other doctrines and works.
The APVs Director-General of the OSCE, Markuu Savike, says that the number of girls in tendering is around 70.
From the staff of the largest banks, most of all investment services have carried out either APV1 or APV2 because they are mandatory under their own rules.
Then there are the smaller banking movements, without mentioning those whose staff appear to have ended up carrying out investigations, Mr Savikka says.
He says that there are 'a few' banking movements of this kind.
According to Savikon, 13 000 people and more demanding APV2 qualifications have been carried out since 2000 by APVC 3 000 people.
Some banking movements believe that the investigation is of benefit.
There are considerably more stringent skills requirements in many other areas of activity.
Mr Savike says that the recommendation for the financial sector requires that the APVV investigations be carried out, because that is where knowledge in the investment sector will be ensured.
According to the Centre, the financial and investment advisers knew, on average, several thousand euros per month, including interest in nature and income premiums.
The average income of periodic working hours is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work in a month will know up to EUR 5 900 and women over EUR 4 500 per month.
On average, the tenth anniversary deserves approximately EUR 8 100.
The tenth of the men who are most familiar deserves more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the most familiar women knew about EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advisers under the Sixth Investment Service can only be issued by an authorised company.
So far, at the level of employees and tasks, self-regulation has been relied on.
According to the inspection carried out by Fava, individual cases of inadequate expertise and qualifications on the part of the investment adviser.
In principle, investment products can also be sold, even if skills and qualifications are scrapped.
From this point of view, the situation has been wild and free.
In many other sectors, there are considerably stricter skills requirements, Mr Savikka says.
According to Savikon, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up by the new financial markets directive (MiFID II).
That means that every company will be responsible for the adequacy of the staff offering investment services.
For its part, financial control is permitted to determine what is to be done.
The Fava market controller, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes to the present is the regulation on the requirements for knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investors.
The new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms themselves and to the stakeholders who sell products on behalf of a company.
Mr Hovi tells us that, according to a government from the Ministry of Finance, Mr Fiori has the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided on during the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide for the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and complementary training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to show that this has also been done.
Mr Hovi specifies that in practice, for example, the company will have to map out staff at an individual level.
This will certainly be different standards depending on whether investment advice or the marketing of products are at stake.
The new is also the requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is inadequate.
In other words, if a company employs a new worker who does not fully meet the criteria laid down, the worker will have to work with a person who meets the criteria.
The change will make the rules more effective and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger aircraft
The flight travelled to the United States in the Flighter Ar24 service.
On Thursday, 787 Dreamlining planes were flying on board Board testing the sustainability of Rolls Royce engines on long flights.
The machine leaving Seattle for 18 hours and 1 minutes has left 15 700 km of journey, which is longer than any stable commercial flight in use in the world.
The flight stayed throughout the journey within the borders of the United States.
In total, it was via 17 Länder.
The swimming of Imatra's slaughterhouses is not a time for the sake of the sake or sunshine - the burning of Ivorian machine with the help of the bathing box.
Iceland Keynesian advances at a good pace, and Time Itmel went on.
Imatra's beaches crushed in Lithuania and Lempur this and next week.
Although between hundreds and then, again, young bathers are not motivated, the bathers' veto Time Itmeter is praying.
In bathing schools this week, a total of 13 children, next week ten, will be expelled.
Next week's child numbers seemed to be starting school and escape, assessing Itmel.
The Imatra Cooperation Sport and the city of Imatra are organised together.
On Thursday, there was a comfortable tunnel on the bathing site.
The sun escaped and young bathing-academics treat keeping up with the bathing tables, someone who is already in the air.
There were also smaller guerrillas in the water.
Ivorian Kivu, 5, first questioned the exhaustion of water.
However, he has always been encouraged by Mr Itkinen to burn for the beaches.
Fine things!
This summer, Ivore Keynesian said that he had visited a great deal of bathers.
He is a good bathing.
Like Ivorian, there were stoning with the bathing box, Vili Huhne, 5.
I too welcome the achievements of today, the bathing water label.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted water.
His daughter, Anna Villberg, 6, followed by bathing off the coast, Ilina Villberg, considers the beaches to be a good start on bathing teaching.
Although the weather has been what happens, Anna, every day, has been thrown up to come here.
There was a need to stimulate one another.
The academic people went on to shrink.
The boys had to bury with the shellfish found off the coast.
Miland Likud, 3, and Anna Villberg spread pyramid, nail fruit and win a day.
In water, education was already continuing, but there was no rush.
Such a thing does not belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier is selling a water doctor - 'This is a seminar-combination story'.
All this can be seen.
A couple of days ago, a soldier who is not familiar with the soldier was sealed.
In other words, clothes and black boxes - as well as' wwcap 'on the beacon'.
An unknown soldier refers to the marketing of cinema and cow in these autumn.
However, there is something peculiar about this combination, and products have been dismissed in the social media: When will Tunteens' health links come?
We must reconcile the company and ask what is at stake here.
What does the Deputy Director-General Aino Mory say?
We are a partner of film.
Like many other companies, we are supporting this film.
We wanted to support domestic production and transit cinema, Messrs says.
According to him, products will be specialised and film will therefore be visibly visible.
Is it not a little futile - often when you think that products and associated stories have something in common?
Yes, it is a semantic story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, Messrs says.
He says that he is in favour of the same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen an old military who is unknown.
And cleaning up is not foreign to the army culture, Mr Messrs points out.
An unknown soldier, for example, is the Valio, Hartward, Saludo, the VR and the hundreds.
So far, for example, the Hartwalll victories have been placed on the market, which are known as Roca, peak ether and Koskelkora.
Tunteoning products have already shown that Finnish Kuvale 's pegistrate in Kallune has been withdrawn.
There are already coffee and bridges available.
I would point out that there is still time for the first August, so there is still room for further progress.
Our unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, such as the Valio, the processor, Neses and the German retailer chain Lidl, Kinunen, for example.
The results of new tests on the age of asylum applicants in Sweden were published.
The latest results of medical testing by Swedish asylum seekers have been published, but the results of the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of tested tests are over 18 years old, but not all of us regard them as reliable.
The Swedish National Office for Justice initiated the test earlier this year.
The tests will be able to assess the age of asylum seekers more closely than before, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish immigration agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claim to be below cost.
The Agency has up to now commissioned 6880 tests, and the Legal Office has now published 2481 tests, which took place between mid-March and the end of July, between now and 2017.
The 80% of asylum seekers tested, that is to say, are over 18 years old, and, in 25 cases, the judicial medicine agency specified that the test was' possibly 18 or parent '.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that asylum seekers are 'possibly less than 18 years old'.
Tests were carried out only in cases where the applicant's age was suspected.
Johan Göson's Office for Justice says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly harmonised; there are no big differences in statistics in the last few months", he said to The Local.
Although the majority of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases there were 'indications that there are 18 or parent'.
When Mr Dagnosdy studied the same results, it became clear that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told us that he was fulfilling 18 years this year.
The medical evaluation method used in testing includes arrogant images of visa hamsters and magnetic images of polemics, followed by analysis by hammer doctors and radiologists, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the sceptics is the endocrine Clave Marcus of the Karolinian Institute, whose work is an assessment of people 's biological maturity, which will determine whether a person has been murdered earlier or later.
'I have had reason to think about this, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
Defining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are definitely unable to determine the age, we should not pretend that we are able to do so ', he said in the Metrorol newspaper.
However, Mr Görson, the Office of the Justice and Home Affairs, argued that the tests were accurate: 'Generally speaking, the risk of determining the child for adultery is small.
The risk is the biggest one in which we will soon have to test 18 years, with the risk of approximately 10% '.
The Ilonian collapse of 30 seats in Scotland
The 'more than five par' result in the third round went back to Mikiko Ignen's 30 pounds of income under the golf-Europe rival in Scotland.
The Ilonian left the Saturday of 11, but it was found at the end of the round to divide 41.
Iceland, following three bogs, found one subsidy bogus difficult.
Others too had difficulty.
An English, Ian Poulter, has risen to split a supreme place in a par round, even though it was said that there were enough work at the forefront of the Quartet.
In other words, it was raze, but it was a good day, Mr Poulter won.
He shares his fellow countryman, Callum Skwin and Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of Western Virginia varies from party to party.
On Thursday evening, at the Trumpin campaign, the Democratic Governor of Western Virginia, Jim, announced that he would change the party.
'democrats simply rejected me '.
'I can tell you today, after many rush and in-depth deliberations... I will tell the Westerners that I can no longer help you as a democrat deposit. '
The public spoke for the sake of applause.
"Republican Party, registered tomorrow as a member of the rhetoric, added."
'Thursday, I would say to you that it is time for a new game. '
Mr Trump promised earlier that a significant declaration would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won at paragraph 42 in Western Virginia because of the lack of support for the democratic candidate, Hillenberg Clinton.
According to Forbi, he is the only one billion governors in his state.
He cancelled a mining company and owns coal brains in five Länder.
His possessions represent approximately USD 1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the RNC (RNC) published a statement that 'Governor Justicò's party change is yet another blow to the democratic party which builds barriers rather than better America'.
'democrats only have 15 governors and fewer Länder than ever before; in this situation, Mr Justicò 's announcement is the last setback for a party which has no leadership whatsoever and cannot find a positive message, a message that unites people, and RNCs Representative RNCs Reveriel McDaniel said in his statement to the CBS news.
Salami has sown the damage - from Thursday to the very bathing day of the summer.
Bathers will also be added to mother-swimming in Finland.
Over the past week, particularly in the West and north of the country and in the Varsinister-Finland region.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the secret attacks caused a number of fires.
According to Medorography, Thursday may become a very bathing day of the summer.
At last, Finnish people have also found copying posts.
Over the past week, particularly in the medium and north of the country and in the Varsinister-Finland region.
By swimming off a biscuit in the electricity centre in winter, I am causing a small fire.
On Wednesday, the ship received notification of the salary at about half an hour.
The Speaker centre was located in a host farm at the end of the wall.
The National Inspectorate dismantled the ceiling and wind in order to discover flame retardants and exhausted the wood.
A total of eighteen housing remained without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
By replacing the secret, the external border was attacked in the militia in Harbour before midnight.
When the rescue facility came in, the building was already at a complete stage and the rescue facility could only prevent the fire from spreading.
Approximately fifty thousand metres of external borders were returned to the country.
In the direction of Kuopia, once again, a father was hidden in his own house.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a fantastic encryption.
The Pelaste was there to check the case, but this time the fire was not allowed to be broken - only a few sums were injured.
In the case of transport, the wind caused problems in the train between Seattle and Vaasa, when the encryption weakened the system of traffic control.
On Thursday morning, information was obtained between eight and nine, after which trains were replaced by buses.
It was only a little before five afternoon that the problem was resolved.
Since then, trains have also been able to continue with the usual volume of bathing.
Salami has sown the destruction around Finland.
However, it has been relatively small this summer.
This summer's bathers have been quite absurd, and you will assess the meteorologi Jari Tavis, a friend of the aeronautical plant.
The vulnerability of Wednesday and Thursday has been mainly fatal, but, as a result of the low level of secret alcohol in the summer, it also seems to be very strong.
This might well seem a great danger, but that is what it has been in comparison with the wounds of this summer.
On Wednesday, there were 1 700 fluctuations in land, and Thursday has had the potential even for the hardest bathing day of the summer: Between 1 p.m. and 16 p.m there were 1 790 countries in the car.
If smuggling goes on to the very beginning, then more than twelve thousand encryptions can be predicted.
The previous record year was in 2015, when the year was around 30 000 secrecy.
By Wednesday, the amount of secrecy this year had risen to 18 386 secrecy.
So there is still room for manoeuvre, so that this year does not break the 'record' of two years ago.
However, the Church can expect to continue.
According to the current state of affairs, Finland will also remain a warm and excuses in the last week, which is a suitable birth environment.
On Saturday, the priority of the Kurds will move from northern parts of the country to the south, where there can be approximately 2 000 secret days, both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more homogenous equivalence in the central part of the country.
In such cases, it is a pity.
Mr Coe praises Russia's apologies for the doping scandal.
The World Sports Agency, Sebastian Coe, praised the apologies it described as open-minded, given the doping scandal, but Mr Coe added that it was not yet time to lift the ban on Russia's participation.
The Russian general sports leader, Dmitri Shljaht, said at the IAF Congress on Thursday that the ban received by Russia was appropriate and that he intends to fight resolutely against doping.
He said that he was sorry 'on behalf of all sportsmen and women who were exported to competition from gold or hedge'.
Despite his comments, the IAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban, which was excluded from universal sporting competition in November 2015, after the WADA report had provided evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
'I think that his reply today was very direct, and it was a very generous proposal ', the President of the IAF, Mr Coe, told the journalists.
'The Council as a whole and the Congress were pleased that the Russian General Sport Association admitted that it had been through difficult times and stated that it was doing everything in its power to reorganise its activities'.
Mr Coe said that he was' satisfied 'also that Russia accepted the conditions for closing the ban.
'In my view, we had a very constructive day and progress, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the working party that it is not the time to stop the Russian ban ', Mr Coe said.
'We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean sportsmen separate from a frustrated system ', he added.
Nine hundred Russian sportsmen and sportsmen are competing with a neutral sportsperson in the Mexico competition in London on Friday, who have fulfilled the stringent IAF criteria.
On Monday, the leader of the IAF working party, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still has to meet many demands before its status can be restored.
'This testing is still inadequate, and those who have been banned continue to operate freely ', he told the journalists on Friday to the IAF Council after his proposal in London.
The company disappointed the weakness of the Tom of Finance Enterprise.
Tom of Finance August has not become the success that the authors wanted.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admittedly, in an interview with the Annika Sucksdordt, who produced the film-producing philosophy.
I said that the Finnish film public might be conservative and it seems to be.
In February 2017, the film was first received.
By the end of June, it had sought a fair 100 000 spectators, which is a little compared with the budget for film, approximately EUR 5 million.
No holiday profit has emerged from this, but it is now important that investors recover their own.
If the film had succeeded better in their own countries, they would already have obtained rape.
We now have to wait for small clubs on foreign spreading, Mrs Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finance is a cinema steered by Daul Karukukuko.
How will the transfer of Nepal to Paris be affected by the economic rules of football?
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Nepal from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germans, the most expensive transfer of football times.
Its possible penalties for Paris Saint Germans (PSG) will determine UEFA, which will regulate European football, which can prevent the participation of teams in a respected Mestar ticket.
UEFA introduced fair play rules in 2011, according to which the PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Nepal has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to conclude the Brazil agreement, and the Nepal annual salary in the new club moves around 10 million dollars.
The transfer of Nepal to France has many economic aspects.
The PSGO has no difficulty in paying for the transfer of Nepal and attaching him to his journey article, as the result will be to finance the government that has been rich by Qatar.
Clubs can spend large sums of money on buying players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that the football business is not defeated.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up at the initiative of the French Michel Platin, elected in 2007.
As a former football player, Mr Platini said that the pursuit of success by debt was a decline and resulted in serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play was shifted from the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that, for the first time in Chelsean, the business model used by Roma Abravitro in 2003 was greatly hampered, and that a team that was badly promising Abrahavius was spending huge sums on purchasing players and created a worldwide British.
The current three-year evaluation period for fair play will take place until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to do up to EUR 30 million.
Although Mr Platini had to leave the work of the UEFA Chairman scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceyhun, would also like to curb the uncontrolled use of clubs.
The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will apply them in the future ', the Andrea Tratax, which is responsible for the economic rules of the fair play in UEFA, told the Association Paul Office last week.
Although PSG paid out of its agreement with one-off reimbursement, it can split the sum in the accounts for his new agreement throughout the summer period.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so that the transfer sum can be recorded as a year of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
On the basis of the economic rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014; the main sanctions were imposed on the PSG and on Manchester City, financed by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to restrict his Mester Anti-Mester team to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is watching clubs who may try to evade its economic provisions by increasing their income through companies associated with the owners of the club.
If, for example, a Austrian company supports PSGs, but the value of aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not be counted as a real income.
This happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar tourist authority for PSGO was over-manipulated.
It has also become apparent that some of the merits of Nepal could be financed by means of payments from the Commission on Mount Myres in Qatar in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Association Committee have banned Nepal being made an envoy of Myanmar competitions, which would be very easy to reveal.
As a result of previous sanctions by the PSGA, UEFA normally monitors companies more closely by circumventing rules.
On Thursday, the sources that are familiar with the situation told us that UEFA has not negotiated the transfer of Nepal.
The sources gave an interview to the Association Press Office on condition that their personnel are not revealed because they do not have the power to discuss the situation in the PSG.
According to the latest publication of the accounts, the turnover in PSGO during the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and over EUR 10 million in business profit.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Nepal to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of follow-up products and game.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Nepal Agreement.
The Spanish Angel, which was claimed to be a violation of the economic rules of fair play, was clearly disturbing the best player in the world.
'In relation to both club and state ', the President of Spain, Javier Tebas, said to a Spanish newspaper, ASS, that is a clear case of economic doping, and he referred to the qualitative ownership of PSGs.
Arsenal's rhetoric, Arsen Wenger, also has reservations about the state funding of football match activities, which is owned by the American sports woman.
'In the last 15 years, WEnger said on Thursday.
'everything is possible after a state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair play, and there will be so many interests in representing the famous player. "
It is now urgent: The sportspeople in Finland Malta in Helsinki
Mr Ghazarya, the Arta Pajani and the three chambers, killed by the photographs of Krisina Mäkel, is drinking in Helsinki, even though he should go to the MLondon.
As a Christian, Messrs may have to compete without the advice of his deposit.
Tomorrow, Mr Pajulahi will compete in the map of the length of time and on Saturday in the triangle.
However, the Catalan white, Armenian Ghazarya, has not received a visa for Great Britain.
Mr Ghazarya has tried to do this in the British Ambassador without any result.
The Valentine has the invitation of Mexico organisers as documentarians, but that too has not made it possible to obtain a visa.
I wonder whether this is the first symptoms of Brexin or what Jorma Kampaan said.
He has always managed visas successfully in the past, but there are now some problems.
He will do all he can to get there.
Ghazarya has been working on the Finnish URBAN Association for years.
It is not so important.
As long as someone looks at the stadium, the Artta Pajlahi said that his deposit could be removed.
Malta mine, Finland, demands miracle from London.
Today, in London, the Mount of Sunday 13 August, will begin to compete on Friday and will last fair week at the end of the week.
Sport, soil coal and residues are species in which Finnish peninsula sportsmen feel passionate about year after year, whether or not they are successful.
In the hearts of athletes, success is measured in the metaphors.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth sportsmen and women who, by acquiring experience, mature sportsmen and women 's performance to the level that adults are genuinely possible.
Now, there are no young athletes in the small Malta team in Finland, but there are no machinery.
Malta for Finland demands miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising nature of sport is that miracles can also occur.
It puts sportsmen on television sportsmen and sportsmen, even though London's metaphors will be solved only late this afternoon because of the era.
Of the previous Malta boats in general sport, Finland obtained one pronounced pronouncement.
It was brought to light by Mr Tero Pitkel.
The fish species are now awaiting a metaphor from Pitjamo, even though one tells him and the other tosses of recent times, as well as the absence of a Pitjamo in the values of last summer.
Whatever happens in these churches, the Pitjamo will remain in history as a great Finnish sporting wounds.
Access for other Finnish sportsmen to final competition or to their own record is a good enough achievement.
Hope and faith in the realistic metaphor of general sport in Finland in the coming years will also be a success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing and financial support of young talents is more important than maintaining a small elite of representation.
Success will not be in time, but will require years of sportspeople and patience, both in education and in the case of sportsmen.
The Finns are also able to value international sporting centres and enjoy their unique performance.
Hopefully, the London cats will remain the guns of Unita and Mo Farah, not for example because of the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Secondly, Enni Rukar in Copper 's big airport -' My admiration '.
Mr Enni Rukareason has been located second in the American Colorado, a big Air.
The Copper Mount, the Copper Mount, is the best window in the world cup in Rukage.
The cat won by women in the United States, Jamie Anderson.
In competition, lakes collected 147 points.
For the first time, he tried his last joke at the caballergies, and it was very close to success.
It seems good and good now, but it is a pity that the last dream did not go well.
I will try to do so from now on in the games, God Rukage.
In the Great Britain, a competitor is smiling from the shops for species.
In Helsinki, the new 'small-scale' vessel collapsed in the port.
The new small-scale vessel FSTR in Viking is very late.
The Pikau vessel was supposed to leave from Helsinki to Tallini at 18 p.m.
There were eight countries in which the ship was loading.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least one and a half hours, I have been waiting to get on board.
At 7.30 p.m, a car journey is now slightly mobile, a Roman Johannes Rebane, awaiting access to the Helsinki port.
Rebane thought that a new vessel had become a technical fault.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought access to the fleet to the aquaculture in its cars.
The Viking Director-General, Christa Grönlase, says to the ISS that there was a technical fault.
It was replaced by the Helsinki port.
The ship leaves Helsinki for a couple of hours late.
Greenland says that the ship is also delaying the return of Tally for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave from Talliness to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
On Thursday evening, 42 metres of special transport hampers traffic on the road to Cuba.
42 metres long special transport is moving from Mexico to the port of Muslim during Thursday evening.
Nine-nine carriers should be well informed by the afternoon.
The police guide traffic on the road to Cuba, and the traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Movements from the point of view of the wild go the way to the port of Muslim.
A small feature: Wet hot euphemism and Comrade Dedcard
At the same time, both the days and the ghull of the 80s (at the time David Wain and Michael Salter made a wonderful The TV chain and its own time) and the year 2001 before Elizabeth Banyá, Avilés Poehler, Paul Rudd and others moved on to the biggest gear.
As a cultural product, it is both a paradox and a description of the constant memorandum to which we have survived in the Frahm era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been living in time.
The Florence Day of Camp acted surprisingly well, not only because of his humour of absurd (which, among other things, reported to be the background to the vegetable survey spoken by Mr H. Benjamini.
The most important thing is that medium-term samples appear to show full age-oriented passages, which make the past impossible to achieve a part of a joke.
I do not think that Year, where adults appear adults, is less emotional, and its paradox is more fragmented: For example, it cuts Stalinists in the 90s, such as the horror film, for example.
In one point, there is a fantastic need for Appeal Powerbok, inlinetestations and 'other window from 1991'.
Many of the stories are the same as they used to be.
The good-hearted Coalition (Michael Salalmonter) is now a writer but has still not been able to survive the Katican (Marguernosis Moreau).
Ken Marino is still news.
And in a lady, the Ronald Reagan (Michael Spealter) is accompanied by George H. W. Bush (who is well shown to be Michael Ian Byrne).
As always in such scenarios, the best side pages are.
It is particularly nonsensical to see the window Paul Rudd, who has a parameter, that is to say Matt Dillon 's patch' Singles'.
The rhetoric of coincidental madness may lead to the flight of this sark as a sort of 'Kurdish Seva' scandal until it becomes apparent: Wet hot peak - Twalear Year - where, at its last meeting, a group of friends will go to the first flight of 'hot gauge'.
The Amazon Comrade Deputy System, once again, calls for another race: The spirit of the Cold War, Atomalonde and even the weight of the GLOWS, where the West is concerned.
The Komediarar has created Brian Gateworde and Alessandro Tanaka, which has guided Rhys Thomas, a Roma policeman in the 1980s, where the Basque cabinet is fighting for truth, atheism and martyrdom.
In the main parts of the world, Gregorina and the idealistic Iosster, Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelu Ulmum, whose turn has dumped in English Channing Tatum (SARS) and Joseph GordonononLevitt.
It is wonderful;
But then there is nothing else.
There are some good vulnerable movements in the SARS (policemen spend time looking at television corridors in the same way as the Americans see football).
There are a number of famous voters involved, including Jenny Swiebel, Nick Ovima, Mahershale Ali and Chloissey Sevigny, who have a great deal of fantasy.
However, Comrade Dedcard is overloaded in the traceability of the socialist drama - there is, for example, a killer behind the Reaganter Memorandum, which is why the sarch often starts to feel more than propaganda.
Six lengthy periods are too long, and the humour of the SARS is not fast enough and not abundant.
In summary, the SARS could be better acted as agitonomic sufferers, for example when Gregor and Iosquierdo are repeatedly visiting the United States embassies and there are always two flags in the greed.
The message to the imaginable Communist public is that the Western culture can make all consumer goods and swifter.
The illuminating Roma creators of the SARS were not wrong: We greeded our own recent history and their history as well.
On Saturday, Tonas Tauru will come into the circle in Macau - in response to the former UFCs match.
Tonon Tauru wants to keep the match.
Tonon Tauru will have a hard girl in Macau, because a Brazilian Leandro was still attending the UFCF organisation last year.
Brazil also has a black water and the world championship of species.
For once, I am against the parents.
It is a fantasy, a 32th-year-old Tauru tells.
Koukiang was supposed to rise in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled because of logistical problems, but the three struggles were swiftly obtained within the framework of the autonomous territory of China in Macau.
Tauru has not previously faced any motives.
This was the first time that I was withdrawn.
It was irritated by the fact that preparations and treaties took a long time.
However, Mr Ottkins is pleased that a new time has been obtained for the struggle.
Waiting a week does not have much to do with preparation.
The transfer does not affect the order, as it does not improve a week.
If you go too far, you can go even worse.
In a few previous struggles, Taura has faced opponents whose strengths are to be overcome.
This time, the situation is different.
The Icelanese are described as a typical Brazilian.
He is rather aggressive.
The fault is that he will be on the threshold in the first place and try to take the journey.
He has won the black World Cup, so he can win the weight.
The last match in Koukiang did not go as planned.
The Philippines Kevin Belingo found Taura to be a great deal of eye and the Philippines had a victory.
I have never done so, especially in my capacity: He did not get a single scoreboard.
When I left to go down, he got my eye.
It deployed a very long time.
New motivation
Some liberals take part once a year, some more frequently.
For example, in September, the future opponents last appeared.
For its part, there were three matches last year.
We are now facing the second struggle this year.
Sometimes, the pace has become heavy.
In recent years, I have been and have been in good condition all the time.
I have, however, only listened for the sake of the match.
When the 322 years of age heard about the future, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoenah and had the pleasure of getting back.
We had very good treaties when there was one car in Sweden too.
Training was a great help, because on Saturday the school gauge will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have had the opportunity to treat the same-size opponents and practise bullying.
The main tactics of the 322 years of age are to be tackled.
We must beat rationally.
If there is to be an opportunity, I will, of course, take it for myself.
Cargo transport must not be allowed free of charge, as they are most expensive.
Macau previously attracts Taura in China.
It is heard by Mr Las Vegas.
I believe that there is a big and fine afternoon ahead.
The English Central Bank is keeping an increase of 0.25%.
The English Central Bank is expected to declare that it will maintain the same increase when economic growth has been flawed and inflation has stopped speculation from interest rates.
The Federal Reserve has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow and the bank has moved interest rates because of increasing pressure on families' incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank 's monetary policy commission decided by 6.2 to 25%, which received less and less support this month because of the unbridled growth of the economy.
In its annual inflation survey, the bank calculated its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecasts for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the incomes of households are under increasing pressure because inflation is still expected to continue to increase close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, interest rates will be needed over the next few years to curb inflation promoted by Brexin, and the bank stated that the cost of loan could be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
Furthermore, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which was initiated a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexitro referendum.
In February 2018, the bank will put an end to the Term Equal Opportunities programme, even though it is now expected to provide affordable funding to banks with a total of GBP 15 million, in other words EUR 115 million.
The protocol on the bank's interest rate says: 'According to the forecast of the Commission responsible for monetary policy, the slow progress of GDP will continue in the next few years as the real income from households reduces consumption'.
As far as interest rates are concerned, the bank reiterated the need for some sort of 'tightening-up' of monetary policy in order to curb inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in 2018 by the third quarter and by 2020.
However, the bank stressed that potential increases are 'gradual' and 'limited'.
In May this year, the bank previously increased by 1.9% and growth of 1.7% for next year.
It has now kept its growth forecasts for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, GBP 0.5% and USD 1.31 were weakened, with 0.4%, and EUR 1.11.
The decision to retain the interest rates was taken after the expected weak growth rates have risen from interest rates, and GDP increased by 0.3% in one quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to stay at 0.3% by the third quarter, but is slightly diminishing at the end of the year.
The recent inflation survey gave little hope of increased inflation and low wages for households, according to the Bank, that the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy 'cannot hinder' the fall in income 'in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will revive' significant 'at the end of the three-year forecasts.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak weighting, which will remove some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25%, after the vote in the referendum ', which was shocked by the horizon, which was dropped.
The bank considers that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and economies only after four years.
Before the Central Bank's most recent decision on interest rates was taken, inflation was increasing pressure on households, and in July three decision-makers called for a interest rate of 0.5%.
Last month, inflation reduced from 2.9% in June to 2.9%, but according to the Bank, it was still waiting and inflation will rise again in the next few months.
According to the Bank, the exceeding of 2% was due to a 'completely weak' threshold.
'In view of the recent fall in swaps, competition on the housing market would appear to be growing even more when the clients are listening heavily to the clients and want to stop the year heavily ', the Director-General of the Brok, Andrew Montlay, will say.
'The market seems to be particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is expiring, which is more popular, low interest rates and also non-cost alternatives'.
NHS amounts to 10 000 controversial HIVS drugs.
Since September, patients can be prescribed a 'translating' HIV, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute on the funding of a medicinal product within the NHS.
The NHS has announced that pre-exposure estate treatment will be prescribed to some 10 000 people during the first three years of experimentation, and before the admission of a medicinal product will reduce infection by approximately 86% of the risk to individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS would be able to pay for the 'EPS' medicinal product, although it claims that local authorities should finance it.
The English NHS leader Stevens described the decision announced on Thursday as' significant new intervention ', and the national AIDS organisation described it as' a crucial moment '.
Sexual health links in London, benghton, Manchester, Liverpol and Shefflio will be the first to receive reporting on an experiment which will extend to other clinics in October, which will achieve its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure estate (Everything B) must be used to nitrate HIV, which reduces infection.
Experiments have shown that the EP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
A medicinal product before being integrated means that there are sufficient medicines in the body which prevent HIV from being infected.
A doctor can take a day or two hours before seats.
The target group includes homosexuals, Bisnisuals, gender mainstreaming and people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose to meet the conditions for experimentation by applicants for men, women and women, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving anti-retroviral treatment.
People living in England and reporting on the treatment of the general doctor can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost GBP 10 million and this week the English NHS signed a contract on medicines after international tendering.
This experiment is intended to assess the potential of the EPP medicinal product by gathering broad clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and carrying out treatment.
'this important new image should complement and intensify existing horizontal and increasingly operational means to prevent HIV ',' Stevens.
'In the struggle which has been going on for more than 30 years in order to address the greatest health challenge for humanity '.
'There is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV ', the Director-General of the National AIDS Organisation, Deborah González.
'if the EPP medicinal product is properly targeted at those who need it and those who belong to risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, a doctor, financed by the NHS, will be able to decide independently on its use without the need to negotiate with the partner, with an impact that will improve the lives of a large number of people.
This was welcome news'.
'The most important thing now is to ensure that this experiment is launched rapidly throughout the country and that no one belonging to the risk group is excluded ',' Terrence Higger's Director-General says Ian.
The 'EPP' medicinal product in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection.
'The launch of the EPP experiment is a welcome event, unnecessarily prolonged by the government's slow-down ', says Sharon Hodgson, the deputy health minister.
'We have evidence that medicinal products can have a reverse effect on our work to prevent HIV and put an end to the spread of this threatening disease.
This experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the EPP medicinal product.
It is now important that this experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect HIV exposure and bring a further step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been stopped '.
Quality of life: Interim and fierce solvency solutions have risen from a small housing of Earl's alert to a stable home.
The former bank, Joanne Leijing, who was enthusiastic about the reproduction of buildings, transformed a smaller housing in Earl 's embassies in 2014.
Housing is on the first wave of the Holy King Annan era: The success of the rhetoric indicates that You has not yet fought and changed.
'In the meantime, I lived with me in Knightbridge in a considerably larger housing ', as you say.
'I looked at something similar in my price class.
I visited this House in my housing and noticed that the poor were as high as my then housing.
I was surprised straight away and made the offer on the same day. "
Since then, the housing of around 90 kg has experienced a complete change of form.
It was a two-fold in which only a kitchen kitchen was allowed to enter the mafia, and you wanted to see more storage space and an interim order to make use of the honey.
'I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands', he says.
He returned from the Duck & Switzerland planning office in Erfa Azadi, who had the task of using almost four metres of housing and creating a housing which is not just a retail and sales target, but a home.
The hygiene level was not enough to duplicate two situations, so the challenge was to build a gap in which one sees fit.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfang.
'Steel structures are rather complicated.
Farms had to be duplicated so that they do not need to be mature.
Structures had to be structured in such a way that the high level is just suitable, both on their head and on their head. "
Erfan was able to invest in duplication of two high-quality mistakes, with fantastic privacy.
A parental window opens the Retlady window with an elegant stay.
Yesterday's window of office, hedge efficiency and autogenic proteins in Serge Mouillen create a distinguished girl.
The use of Peils leads to theatre, emotion and light.
Soft corridors on both fronts of short corridors seem to be a real long way off.
The peat in the vicinity is like a window opening the door to another room.
There is a storage space for flavourings such as guerrillas in Joanne and pigs.
What is more acute is that the spring will be hidden when it is not used.
Machines fitted with the Taitrus are not a new solution;
But it is unique in the Yoanne spring to raise the door in the same way as the door to the car.
'There was little planning ', Erfa tells us about a steel sanction door to MDFs.
"It is balanced, that is to say, it is very easy to raise its place."
With the rational use of farm and conservation planning, Mrs Joye received 16 extra names, another mafia and a better basic solution.
"When you sell housing, the surface area will decide - or the value of buildings", Erfa says.
"In the case of fundamental cases, the property mediator is in the hands of housing and calculates the price on the basis of the surface area."
In the housing of Joanne, the surface area was added by using high-quality materials which bring about luxury.
"Inhabitants are in contact with the materials of housing, and the feeling of housing is partly based on them", the Erfa says.
"Nobody is interested in the electrical authorities in walls.
They too are important but not in the same way. "
The housing of Joanne is an example of the fact that good planning and licences can make basic housing exceptionally fine.
Then it may also be that housing no longer wants to change.
A pregnant pricing Sofi radiated in its summer holdings.
In the Prince of Sofir, the election of the people was a laughing stock.
In a prime minister, Sofi represented Sweden in B8stadt for the last time before her birth.
The illuminating pricing of the 'Syiness Tommunications' event had chosen a fraction of a national meal.
Sofi was on the occasion of smiling.
In the Swedish prime minister, Sofi has visited Sweden this week in Boustadt.
On Wednesday, Sofi was represented by the splendid blue pro-winter at the A Tommons seminar, which went well at the latest at the latest.
Sofi arrived in a fierce housing.
This is the last meeting in which Sofi will be represented before her birth.
He has calculated his time in September.
For the evening of the event, Sofi had chosen a beautiful pasteurant meal which was splendid.
High remuneration and elegance were at the top of the glass.
The Pasteinsiness went well.
This week, Sofia has been on the Swedish delegation mission in Boustadt.
Mrs Sofi complemented her on a small platform.
Mr Sofi was quite frankly irradiated in his summer holdings.
Sofia was even rebelligerent in the event to teach photographers.
Now, Mr Sofi said a laughter and referred to his final pregnancy.
He raises us with a sweet pool.
In the summer of 1996, a test appeared on the brink of the sheer food.
The Laotians did not dare to land but went beyond.
In Koje, food was sold between Prina Suamsririd and Penal, between the subsidised Panja.
He was not very familiar with Finland, and the Finns were not yet able to do so.
Since it did not dare to eat, Mr Panja offered free Maoists.
In this way, he teached the Americans to eat a thaire, a spring squeeze.
He said about countries.
I left a piecemeal school.
I have visited more and more, at the end of the day.
In the summer 1997, Mr Panja opened his thairbag in commercial control.
There were two small tables, less than 20 customer sites.
He teached us not only to eat the thaire, but also to sit down on his boat.
When there are hunger and seats restricted, we cannot leave the window of wind between ourselves and foreign.
Little more attention was paid to us and we became beautiful.
At the end of the day, I was sitting with the text in order to learn from the threshold.
Two years went by commercial control, but then the food supplement had to be changed, because the pharmaceuticals themselves would be too much in control.
A new location was released from the end of the guard.
There is room there.
Today, we shopkeepers will be able to sit back on our own table again, only at the most congested times, but we will probably have to ask the guests whether there is room in the wrong place.
Mr Panja knows his client.
He is told that he is familiar with what has happened and who has been seen.
He knows what food they eat.
He has seen how clients' lifestyles vary and feedingstuffs are changing.
He recalls which man and I went to eat my first spring.
He recalls me as a layer and as a meat, and recalls what I was a young person.
It is controversial to go to lunch a little later than others, to sit down the door of my local spring door and to exchange their belongs with Mr Panja, who is reporting.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality as a sweetener.
He has opened up our ideas and our hearts in addition to our tastes.
Nowadays, many speakers speak to him on the threshold - thanks to the increased level of protection for tourism.
I admire Mr Panja.
Although he has been difficult, he is always friendly.
He is diligent.
He is on the brink of work in the field of aid and black.
Last week, the food supplement celebrated two decades of infiltration.
We customers were given a subsequent diamond.
Without any shame or attention, it took place today, at the top of the work.
The discovery of 173 Interior terrorists, who were prepared to host in Europe, was revealed on the land base.
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities had a significant list of anti-terrorism work.
More than 170 children contain information from Interior fighters who are prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document covers not only their personal data but also pictures of everyone.
More than 130 people on the list are Iraqi, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Iltas told the list and a couple of weeks ago I was back.
Now, the seat of the list and the information contained in it have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found personal data and images containing a list of terrorists when examining the geographical bases of the terrorist organisation in Mosuli.
The US intelligence authorities will evaluate the authenticity of the papers and send them to Interpol.
The list was distributed from INTERREG to all the security authorities in the countries of Europe in May.
The reason for this was the fear that something big and serious might be envisaged in the West about the action of terrorists in the vicinity of Iceland.
According to die Well, the list has not only the names and images of all individuals but also their birth age, the underutilised undertakings and information about the country of origin of the person.
There are also specific terrorist sectors on the list.
For example, the German 27-year old Sami J.
He is reported to have gone from Germany to Egypt in 2012, then to Libya, and later via Turkey, to Syria in order to join the riots of Ivori.
His image is written as a special suicide bomb.
There is no more precise information about the fate of the man.
In total, around 6 000 fighters have been left in the Iceland, whose fate is uncertain.
The man fell below the price in the Tokokokokov coast of Helsinki.
On the basis of interview with the rescue facility, a man had wanted to show that the time was running.
The elderly can save the spirit of the picture.
On Thursday, a person below water was saved in Helsinki.
According to Mr Estlander, the situation was over quickly.
Someone was found in the water for about 15 minutes after the notification.
He was found in the butcher of the rescue plant, Mr Estlander says.
The ship received half after four this afternoon.
The person was sent to first care.
Mr Estlander says that it was about 50 years of age.
On the basis of these interviews, the man wanted to show that the time was running.
The situation in the Tokokokov coast is already over.
Mr Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the border guards and the police.
It was a task led by a corps of border guards.
The young people also learned excellent lessons from the filters.
It was over 15 minutes.
The man was saved from water together with a border guard and police.
Two passenger cars collapsed in Eura - nine people in cars, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in cars, the remainder of whom were more vulnerable, who reveal a friend of fire.
Among those injured there are men and women.
The accident took place in three days' time.
Mr Kolari took place when another car came to the warning triangle to guarantee another car, revealing a daily fire-fighter.
According to the rescue facility, there is a limit of 80 km per hour.
Debts are fighting for property of more than USD 500 million.
Two brothers dispute the major buildings empire in Victoria, which is worth over USD 500 million, which is related to the family company set up 40 years ago by their Italian community.
The former Chairman of Carlton and the buildings development, Colin De Lutis, are only living in the Toork area at three walls from his younger brother, Paulsen, and the younger debt has exported to the Supreme Court the dispute over the distribution of property between brothers between buildings and business.
Mr Paul has wanted to leave the family enterprise since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute.
Credits and their mother, Anna, together owns 38 buildings worth more than USD half a billion; the family began to acquire property when they buyed Collingwood Smith in 1973.
The family was set up there by Westco Jeans, which was widespread to 160 movements.
The Caucasus package was sold by USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on buildings, and today the family owns offices, buildings in Brunswick and Sorrenne and houses in Gaul Coastu and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in urban areas.
According to the agreement with the past father, the Colin owns approximately two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's wealth, Mr Paul describes his father as the 'family's power and the central hostility'.
According to legal documents, the allocation of property means that Colin owns buildings of approximately USD 316 million and Paul worth approximately USD 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of buildings and funds.
'I think that, in his proposal, Mr Colin submitted the best buildings for himself ', Paul wrote in his first lie document to the courts in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with at the Supreme Court for the first time, after several attempts to reconcile.
Credits now also dispute who dominates existing business, and Mr Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from business.
According to Mr Colin, this is not true, and he accuses Paul of poor management of certain buildings.
Mr Colin wrote one of his first lie certificates that he would like to find a solution.
According to our Italian traditions, the family is the most important of me, as Mr Colin says in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of opinions, e-mails and reports on this incident, in which consultancy companies such as Daul, Pitcher Partner and Keck Crace, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Morba.
At the end of the 1970s, De Luigi and his advanced husband were Italian migrants who created milk-bars and sensitive trading at the end of the 50s, buying Brunswick.
They were used as an assurance when the family buys a fireworks from Collingwood to which Colin set up the family's first farce trade.
Mr Colin says that he has set up trade in the last few years, when Paul was still a child (approximately ten years old).
De Lutis tells us that he and the dead Luigi in 2012 wanted to transfer buildings to their boys in an appropriate manner.
"Mrs Luigi often said that she does not want brothers to come to justice", Anna writes in her statement.
According to Colin, two other boys, Mark and Luke, no longer participate in the business activities of the De Lutis group, which claimed that Mark received USD 10 million and Luke USD 26 million when leaving the company.
According to Mrs Paulsen, Luke and Mark are 'bitter economic conditions'.
Colin has had a low profile, even though there is a former member of the Australian Government's Anigarchy and TV-sponsored friend of Eddie McGuiren in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutch and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, he said in his report that it is not possible to comment on this because it is dealt with in court.
'It is very sad that my brother, Mr Paul, has chosen to challenge me and, according to the name of our family, to withdraw to justice '.
In mid-2016, Mr Colin wrote to the courts that he had tried to meet his brothers' demands.
"Our fathers would not have liked us to argue in this way", Mr Colin continued and said that he still hopes that a solution will be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have exhausted.
'We shall decide in court in the near future ', Mr Colin wrote.
The new Deputy Director-General of Trumpin intends to restrict the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will at last succeed.
The first.
According to the Polticou, the new Director-General of the Belarus intends to restrict the use of President Trumpin's media and the monitoring of news so that the bomb does not suffer so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Secretary-General of the Belarus, met in his first day of work, raised a key problem which he intends to resolve: He intends to restrict access to President Donald Trumpin.
Mr Kelly told the workers in the Belarus that all information - weighed and also heard at information conferences - must go through him, because he takes better decisions when he gets good information. "
Mr Kelli's words make sense, but others have also tried to limit the use of the Trumpi media and failed.
President Trumpi has a relationship with television for decades - and he is still looking at a lot of television as President.
"If the president candidate, Mr Trump, woke up from unfair news, he was in favour of showing that the beneficial media handled things more fairly", Sam Nunberg, who was working in the Trumpin campaign as adviser, told the Politicov newspaper in February.
The journalist of Politico, Tara Palmeri, wrote at the time that 'the management of Trumpin Trumper Twitter's use of Trumper' is essential that his personal media office should include an equal flow of praise '.
Clearly.
But it is ridiculous to say that the use of Trumpin Trumper has never been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know what others do not know - maybe Trumpi-wiebel would have been even poorer without their efforts.
We will probably never know what messages from Trumpi were not sent.
If his staff have at least been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been pointless.
But nobody has consistently been able to prevent the heat caused by Trum.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in Belarus who are trying to drive their case by providing Trum with information that supports their views, which may be reliable - or not.
In May, Mr Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the President questionable information.
The journalist Shane Goldmacher told us about a case:
'The current and former workers in Trumpin say that they can love immensely from press movements which criticise him - especially if they report harmful data leaks, and then they are forced to know where the data originates.
That is what happened at the end of February when someone gave a copy to the President of the net provocation, Charles C. Johnson, who was accused of several years of information in the White House.
Mr Johnson had been permanently removed as a result of the harassment of Mr Twitzerland, who had previously disseminated false accusations and then withdrawn them, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
In spite of this, Trump had begun to ask the staff about Walshh.
Mr Goldmacher added that the then Director-General of staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary of State of the Belarus, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a system for managing documents that go to Trumper '.
And what was the result?
Three months later, Mr Kelly is trying the same.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective leader than Priebus, but Mr Trump is still his own dilemma and his assistants are still driving his own way.
These unfortunate facts make the Kelly task very difficult.
Neymar concluded five years' agreement with PSGO.
Mr Neymar, a five-year agreement with the French football corps as a football star, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that representatives of Nepal had paid a football price for the FC Barcelona expansion of EUR 222 million in the Spanish flag.
The Nepal Agreement with Barcelona was therefore suspended and he was free to move to PSGM.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the biggest transfer in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester Unitedy, which cost EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
The state-owned state-owned PSG, Qatar Standards, is owned by the PSG.
The club chairs the former doctrine profession, the shadow Nasser-Khelaifi.
Nepal is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The writer, Raiand Oranen, explained on the shoulder of alcohol and air fear: 'I am in my life'.
The newspaper writer Raiand Oranen, who has just spent 69th years on the 'Towards' and on clean light species.
Mr Howitt helped Rail Orko.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren take mutilation, when they said that Rail and his husband, Jyrs, abandoned the sun in Spain and Fuengirola's housing after 18 winter.
First, they sold their house, but now, in the spring, they also left temporary housing.
In the light of light and sun, the old Olympic Games were once withdrawn from the depression and alcohol race that he has survived.
External action is also 20 kg lower.
The weight went down when the herbal medicines were abolished, they were meaningful.
At the time, I was able to help with alcohol-related shells, which was also the case with fears and profit.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol exports people, an irritating writer says openly.
Rail and Jyrki Oranen have been travelling the same journey for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
The Rail and tourist industry, too, have been working together for over 40 years.
I was, and was, married in two weeks, Rail and laughing.
The Queen of such a drama has always been, and has always stopped his life from that, Mr Jyrki, who was wealthy.
The massive writer, Mr Oranen, only recalled a fine 4440s label of clean whitefish, which affected and moved over from the lamb to Finland.
I decided once and for all to fall within the scope of the brutal family when I read in an aeroplane Liisa Sepplu's 50th interview.
I was a daughter of my own, my mother also had a clothing movement and sometimes acted as mankind, Mr Oranen's memory.
He has changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
It was revealed by Mr Oransel.
Raiat Orane lives as an active writer and has many concepts with work - hundreds of ideas.
The walks returned over the wild 's heads'.
The wealthiest farms in West Midlands are once again on the line of support with persistent rotators who succeeded in overcoming the desperate parts of the municipality and returning to the wildlife of houses.
The Kerakas stopped being paradoxically housing close to what is termed a spade in Solihood.
They were driven out of the region in May, but they succeeded in overcoming the desperation that was needed as a barrier to the municipal route, bringing children, horses and the army of package cars.
They succeeded in crossing the road barrier in a point that was not protected because of incineration.
The ravaged inhabitants have accused Mr Solana of 'his total inability to resolve the problem'.
An anonymous inhabitant tells him that the rotators came from Bennley Heathen on Monday evening, where they had thrown the guide on the screen.
"Society must be deployed because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
They were here in May, then they left but returned.
This evening they arrived more and probably even more today '.
The inhabitants said that the Birmingham regime had solved the problem by banning access to the fires.
'I live in Streetbrobrobrobroke Road and it is frustrating to pay a municipal tax when society is unable to do anything about it '.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that rotators should return so soon after they were driven out.
'There are more than before, and they have even counted a horse into the park. '
According to Mr Solana's municipal information, the public is aware of the illegal interruption in the vicinity of Street Roadh, "we are taking the necessary legal measures with Mr Solana's police to curb the camps as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many local as possible should notify the police of harassment or criminal activities.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings'.
The depleted people injured the Portuguese aircraft.
In Portugal, men on the beaches full of people have been tried in court today.
Yesterday, two people died as a result of the paedophilia.
Two men flying a machine can be prosecuted for the death penalty.
In Portugal, 16 years of imprisonment are at most possible.
Yesterday, for technical reasons, a small flight flying by men had to make a coast off the coast of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon.
At the time of events there were hundreds of people on the coast, some of whom are forced into water.
The plane was born in a girl between 566 and 86 years old, who immediately died.
The machine first came to the man who was the clearest machine.
Immediately afterwards, the machine came up and, once it reappeared, came to the child, told the newspaper Filipe Janeira Jorhola de Noticias.
A young girl died off the coast with his parents.
Parents of girls were not injured.
Immediately after the accident, the trawlers inside the scene were hatred.
The girl and other people went with their creativity and started to dispel the heritage, reported in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called a carrier a criminal, he was desperate.
It is surprising that there were no more people dead.
Two men on the machine were not injured in the expulsion.
The tragic loss of Finnish pedestrians once again won Malta: 'Without an accident, I would not be a world champion'.
Early on Wednesday morning, Matti Sörm was celebrating Finnish Mount bananas in the competition in Canada Big Whitehead.
In the past, the Sörm Hamas won the Crosss Mount.
All in all, three MGPs have already been collected.
Quite incredible Ms!
Twice the gold, the fairly good reason is that the telephone-sponsored Sörm Hamari was delighted.
A 30-year-old cargo commended his voters and very successful preparations in Finland.
According to Sörm Hamas, the number of intermediaries in species is increasing all the time.
The whole parameter has grown and evolved a great deal recently.
The differences are declining and there are many new calculations.
We always wonder whether there will be a black horse.
Every cat seems to have a different winner.
In 2009, the Study Hamas lost its second peak in the motorcycle.
He had calculated enthusiastically with his young friends, and the accident did not take us to the brink.
I will remember from time to time that what my life would be without accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in concealing.
They play down what has been distributed, Sörm Hamas emphasises.
It would be a barbaric spade for a serious accident and a loss of time as a tour of luck, and it is not being done by the Sörm Hamas.
But he turned his attention to the difficulty of carelessness.
Yes, I would say that the situation became a victory.
I would not be a three-fold world champion without accident.
Before the accident occurred, the largest platform in Sörm Hamas was already slowing down.
It was only after the accident that Dutch was actually going to get off the ground.
As a young person, I met the TV, and we always enthusiastically encountered X. Games.
But they were remote dreams which went some way over time.
After the accident, I found myself in some way from the XI-Games story.
I would not have been able to imagine in advance.
I was twenty-three years old and I thought that this would really be a long life if I am left here to shrink and sad.
I decided to withdraw the hostilities and start work.
I would say that I have been quite successful.
It was with great pleasure that the wheelchair Leoya-Peking was appointed as a sportsperson for a year.
A nursing Olympic winner won his prize at the sporting gallery in January.
According to Sörm Hamas, profit is an important signal to parameters.
It was a great blow and the victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open up bridges to the apartheid world.
Since it is time to launch a two-fold World Cup campaign in Mati Sörm Hamas?
It will then be seen in due course.
I shall try to do my best to succeed.
The Sörm Hamas has not yet invaded all the top-level that it has invaded.
Next year, the great objective will be borne in mind.
In a year 's time, paralysis will take place in Korea.
Yes, you go there to apply for a metaphor!

Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to a study, more than half of the young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% of the defendants could think that they would return to their country and 4% could not say.
According to a study, young people's decision on repatriation is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Iceland in the country.

Mont Widenus spends half of its time in order to keep the net in order - the database that he has developed, for example, Wikipei and Googenburg.
The company MariaDB is developing a database of 'the fastest growing' in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, set up by the Koodariar entrepreneurship, Michael Michael 'Monti' Montenegro, will not cost users anything at all and can be developed through NEA by any mobile software.
For example, Mr Google and Mr Wicipel are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily the customers who pay.
By means of the databases, huge amounts of data remain in order and quickly accessible.
If, for example, you use Linkedini, Twitch or Booting.T., you will use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information, which is not a description, comes from the database and pictures are bordered there", explains Widenus.
The Widenius, which is the technology leader of MariaDB, spends around half of its time on the test.
The man who is distancing himself from south-east eyes will help to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenburg, together with the Swedish David Axmark, developed the most popular open source code of information in the world.
In 2008, the technology company Sun MySQL bought at USD 1 billion, and a year on, the software giant Oracle greed Sun by EUR 7.4 billion.
When the Orazil trade took place, a large proportion of the development of the MySQUL said they would go.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain pledge about the future of the MySQUL", Widenus is remembering.
He had already set up a company that started to develop MariaDB at this stage.
He did not want his life to die.
I returned from Sun to the best developing country and ensured that the code's continuity will be safeguarded by the same nets that it has created.
Since MyaQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own fragility.
The name simply had to be changed.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
During the 'MySQL', these assurances were not carried out, Widenus deplores.
Although many have heard about Widenburg and the MySQUL's billions, few Finnish people know nothing about MariaDB.
"Our growth rate has been around 50% a year," reveals the economic leader of the MariaDB, Kennh Pakvalvalén.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Mr Papayannakis is is a scarce company's profits.
He reveals that MariaDB estimates this year that it will be receiving opportunities of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it, from which the business players are prepared to pay.
MariaDB will also help to exchange databases, which may be more than a year 's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The change from MySQL to MariaDB will be a success in time, because they are different versions.
The Spanish operator, Mr Telefón nica, and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are MariaDB customers.
The most popular pilot services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Aznar, Alibaba Chind, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically spreading to new users in the distribution packages for the use of Linux, where MariaDB has largely replaced Burma.
Although we are small, we have links with the biggest players.
'In our ladders there are one of the world's largest telecommunications operators, players, banks and even the central bank of the river ', Mr Pakvalvalén.
Giant databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP are still dominated by the information market.
Mrs Myral, too, is modest in comparison with the traditional closed database of the company.
Although, according to Mr Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, fears such as MariaDB are still meaningless, albeit growing rapidly.
The databases of approximately USD 50 billion on the database market, the open source code, do not even exceed 1 billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users do not pay anything about these software.
The research company, Mr Gartner, predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged to open or the transfer would at least have started.
Big companies will not get new customers, because the majority of them will then choose an open source code.
This has led to a deterioration in licensing charges for commercial databases.
Companies want to do as much money as they did in the past with a smaller number of customers', Widenus is wondering.
As the exchange of a closed database is laborious, most customer companies have flouted their price increases in a listening manner.
"There are many customers who find it very difficult to move on because their old applications and others are in a closed database", Widenus says.
However, he believes that clients are going to become full.
As licences rise every year, the customer will move sooner or later on to the database of an open source of information.
The price is between 10 and 20% of the past and better service because, if they so wish, the customer can easily exchange a different database.
Besides, many companies have major changes in systems when transferring their activities to pilot services.
At the same time, there are many who change the databases.
Last spring MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries ever.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now going to employ more.
One reason for the financing of EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
A company has public customers in, for example, Great Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros each year from databases.
'There are many countries that want to move from open source to solutions and use tax money in this way more efficiently ', Mr Pakvalvalé says.
It is unfortunate that in Finland, for example, money is being spent on closed health systems, when open systems are cheaper and there is no space at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is an ideology, but I think it is a better way of doing it.
The Community helps and does something that cannot be done themselves or cannot.
The 5th-year-old Widenius, along with the other Finnish, Linux's development, Linus Torvaldt, is one of the most familiar promoters of open access.
Widenburg will help other companies to develop workable business models on an open source of access.
I still have 4- 5 speeches every year throughout the world on this subject.
Italy is exacerbating its attitude to civil protection vessels.
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations which save refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
'if non-governmental organisations do not commit themselves to the new guideline, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate ', the Interior Minister, Marco Minniti, said in an interview with La Stampa.
The Minnitin warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a vessel of the German Jugalet Association, whose crews were suspected of cooperating with traffickers in human beings who promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the Assistance Assistance Organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of Ambrogio Cartova.
"For us, the saving of human lives is and will be the most important, and we very much regret the fact that we are not currently in a position to act in the search and rescue area", in a statement published in the social media.
'We will only be able to assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and we will be able to assess the situation '.
Since October, the Italian authorities had observed the 'Iuvorian' organisation.
The crews are suspected that they have gradually taken refugees directly from traffickers in human beings who have recovered boats.
One such incident is claimed to have occurred only a couple of kilometres away from the Libya coast, which is revealed by the public prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crews are suspected of having threatened the Italian coastguard to monitor civil protection in the region, which is the motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, vessels such as Ivory must have an Italian police force to monitor the activities.
Only three non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the line of action: Mr Lapland and Mr MAS, as well as the Spanish Protection Action Open Arcelor;
On Thursday, he announced that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not create any "significant changes or obstacles to the rescue of" organisation. "
Among those who refuse to comply with the code of conduct, the Nobel Prize for Frontiers.
Mr Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen dramatically in recent weeks, as he sees as proof of the fact that efforts to strengthen the coastguard in Libya and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In recent days, the Minister said," We have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
He revealed that the plans will continue to discuss projects for economic development with the mayors of Libya this month, as well as measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
There is a suspicion of the dead unmarried partner in Enonede, suspected of being found in the country - a suspected prosecutor.
The suspected crime occurred in Enonino Kenya last December.
According to the police, a 36th-year old man is suspected of killing his Scottish unmarried partner.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspected would have fled with two dogs in the country since their deeds.
A man was found in a cold country and did not take up resistance.
The accusation must be raised within less than a week.
This case may be dealt with in Lapland's wife's court until August.
Mr Harry Potter and Mr Robert Hardotti, who is familiar with my full friend, have died.
The Brittcher, Robert Hardy, has died at 91.
On Thursday, this family was reported by the actor.
Mrs Hardy, born in 1925, started her sunshine at the age of 24.
During his long career he also appeared in films and television.
Mrs Hardy is thinking in particular of the role played by the Tamil Minister, Cornelus Tigo, in Harry Potterterer, and her veterinary role in the TV architecture based on James Herriot.
A total of seven-seven-fold scenarios were described as the agreed BBC.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for textiles instigated by suicide.
Massachussian woman has been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for textiles and telephone calls in which his son, Conrad Royy, was deemed to be inciting him to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, 15 months in prison and five years in a condition.
Mr Carter was sentenced in June and his son, Conrad Roy, did suicide on 13 and 7.2014.
'my family has been murdered ', the father of Conrad said at the Thursday sitting.
"My son was my best friend."
Mr Carter tried to change the judgment and to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a judgment of 20 years, but according to his lawyers both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Mr Carter, who has fallen into the attraction of the Red Cross, listened to the hand of his judgment in the risk of being born in the country.
"His actions killed Conrad Royy", the prosecutor said to the courts.
'he decided to live in Conrad in order to improve his life.
He has not taken responsibility ', the prosecutor continued.
'he has not shown the disappearance '.
According to Mr Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by 'shocking circumstances', which Mr Carter deeply covers.
However, judge Lawrence Moniz was of the opinion that the Carter 's actions did not have a significant impact on the age or maturity of the Carter, or even on the problems of public health.'
The prosecutor read the statement by the mother of Conrad Lynn Royy, in which he said that 'no day I do not die.
I would like him to be proud of me and of how I can cope with all of this, and I will try to frustrate his guerrillas in this pain which we will always be taking on. "
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the courts that he was' persecuted 'the idea that he will never see his brothers disappear and that he will not have fulfilled his children.
'It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since my birthday, and it is never rushed ', as Mr Camdy said.
It seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the Massachusetti State to stimulate suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Ry was found in a car to be poisoned in 2014.
The incident attracted the attention of the local authorities when it became apparent that Mr Carter, in his textiles messages, had encouraged his son to do suicide.
'Hirta himself, a smile, a smile, a self-cloak, and I do not know how many habits are, Mr Carter wrote in a number of messages he had sent to Royo in two weeks' time before this death, at that time Ry was on holiday with his family.
Just a few moments before Rome's suicide, Mr Carter wrote: 'You must do it, Conrad' and 'Sinu must only launch a championship and be free and happy'.
The judge, Mr Moniz, said that Mr Carter drew attention to the death of Royal, and that the judge stipulated that Carter would not benefit by giving interview.
The case has divided the opinions of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter: One defender is Amanda Knox, 30, sentenced to murder of his British dead in Italy in 2007, two years later.
Los Angeles Tormer published a Knox opinion saying: 'Michelle Carter needs sympathy and help, not imprisonment'.
NATO Secretary-General: The worst wars in Russia since the cold war
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has greatly deteriorated, commented on Thursday by the NATO Secretary-General, Jalvantentenberg.
Sitenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that the relationship between NATO and Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, as Mr Segtenberg said in an interview with the CNN.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
However, since the illegal integration of Krimi, in 2014 and in the Russian Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Satenberg, however, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from escalating and a new cold war.
Before the comments made by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, were able to say that the relationship between the United States and Russia was even at a dangerous level.
Mr Trump invited us to thank the countries for their bad colours in the Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
My heart will change 850 000 diesel engines because of the setback experienced by car manufacturers.
A day before I announced that BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The Director-General of the BMW said that 'there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions', which he referred to in European cities, including BMWs's home city, Munich, who are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Mrs Döler announced that she would make changes to engines of more than three million Mercedetus in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about readmission.
European car manufacturers have put a strong market in the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to achieve the CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and asthma.
The cost of installing waste-neutral equipment will rise and it will be difficult to cost cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored and Chancellor Angela Mergel has been accused of compassion and ignoring the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, and Volkswagen installed in cars with waste-feeding devices that reduced emissions in accordance with the rules, and in normal time emissions were higher.
Many Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of leaders are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former steel minister in Germany was arrested in Germany.
Zorheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, a criminal investigation into Volkswagen was referred to, and the authorities suspected that a system for evading European emission requirements was installed in a similar investigation in the United States.
A survey of Volkswagen could significantly weaken the position of Volkswagen: The car manufacturer has a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The vote in Venezuela began with lively, large demonstrations on authorisation.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a gesture which has no role to play in the election result, and the Chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Tibishops Lucenan, said to journalists.
Madame assures us that the crisis will end.
On Sunday, a controversial vote was held in Venezuela with a delegation intended to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised anti-demonstrations against changing it.
The opposition against Madura has postponed its own demonstrations in such a way that they would be under way at the time of appointment.
According to the 'El Pais', national security forces in the country started on Wednesday evening to take over from their national parliaments.
The force is supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment opportunity.
Climate change threatens the boat of Provency.
The boats have become the symbol of the Alpine region in France, but now it is threatening climate change.
It was because of drought and insecurity, and researchers and farmers are heavily trying to find a solution to the problem.
'In the area of Provency, which has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, 'the size of the population in the spring and, in particular, in the autumn', says the CREPAM Research Institute specialised in agriculture and Eric estate.
"This will reduce the lifetime of boats.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small plants into the region, which spread microbic reactors. "
The stakes are hard.
Petroleum oil attracts tourists and is also a very desirable ingredient of drinking water and cosmetics.
Instead of 'long-term and big games', we now have smaller pictures, which are weak or weakened or completely lacking ', as it says.
'In other words, there are fewer and fewer components of oilseed oil. '
A solution is being sought by intensifying irrigation, by slowing down the volatility of the soil and by swimming up the Saven and water mixtures that protect plants, and by developing a new drought that is more sustainable.
The murder of journalists illustrates the growing threat in Mexico.
On Wednesday, the newspaper 'Riodos', which appeared in the week, usually meets in Wednesday to discuss how the newspaper deals with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless apologies in the state of Sinalia.
Today, however, we are debating security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routes.
Two experienced journalists will discuss who is safer: Leaving children home or including them in the provision of the Kurdish attack in 2009.
The security experts have written three words to the list in the front line: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They are asking journalists to name each group; evidence is not needed, detection and expertise are not enough.
The table will be written on the names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being subjected to salaries by the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the chaos in Mexico life hazardous.
According to the journalists, at least 25 journalists have been assassinated since President Enrique Peña Nieo took office in December 2012, with 589 journalists attacked and threatened in the course of this year, at least seven journalists in seven states have been murdered.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Carden, the founding father of Riodocen, the journalist and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Mr Valdez wrote together on many of his books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere, and the Riodoctrine of the Riodoctre building conceals the enormous image that Valdez seems to be a middle-slave: 'Justice', and Molmetic journalists Aaron Ibarra and Mikam Ramirez have fallen into Tamrez, which repair the shells of Valdez and have been shaped in Valdez.
Less than two months after the death of Valdez, journalists are discussing their common track, their nightmare, their dreams and their persecution.
In 2010, a federal public prosecutor was set up, in particular to deal with the case of journalists, but only two charges have been raised so far, according to the Commission for Protection.
The murderers of journalists rarely have to be brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of murders of drug trafficking and organised crime every year come to justice.
The journalists in Riodoctrine will continue to write about the violence in Sinala, even though they are sad and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the Security Assembly will be of little use, because the killers are not aware and there is no hope of justice.
'This meeting is frankly a waste of time ', he says.
'We cannot count on anyone as long as we do not know the reason for this'.
Mr Valdez had left Riodoctre in the capital of the State, Culian, from 15.5.2017 this morning.
He had driven him to Toyol only a couple of cards when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shores, presumably with the name of the newspaper: "Riodoctrine means twelve."
The ammunition driven it out of the car in Valdez and triggered it at the end of a journey.
Mr Valdez was fifty years old.
He left his wife and two adults.
Rumours move rapidly and wake up freely in Culian.
The death of Valdez is, however, a caricature.
Sinala has been one of Mexico 's most network fighters since arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill a vacuum.
On the streets of Sinalia, someone or many people die every day, and there are two-tier squabbles of drug soldiers which are larger than many housewives.
In a state located off the coast, there is' peace 'when only one cartel manages ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Mr Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Mr Riodoctre, the 60th-year-old Imail Bojorquez feels guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors led to the assassination of Valdez.
In February, the Riodoctrine published an interview with Damaso Learzi, led by a competing group which is waging war against the boys of Guzmann.
The boys of Guzmann may have been angered by a train: The clients suspected of being members of the English were buying every number of newspapers as soon as the newspaper came to sales points.
Another error was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another publicity was attacked.
Mr Valdez was legitimate in Mexico and abroad and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid of him.
He had made a long career at Noroesse when he decided to set up five colleagues in 2003 with Mr Riodocen, who then sold the shares of the newspaper on USD 50.
In Sinalia, 'it was impossible to make the problem of drugs', as Mr Bojorquez says.
In the long term, the newspaper was beginning to feel bold and honest about its brave and honest train and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class vibrations without fear of censorship, and those listed in the newspaper, which nobody else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodow won the respected Maria Moore Prize in Latin America.
In the same year, Mr Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of journalists' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs with the courage to follow Mexico's story of drug trafficking without delay.
He openly admitted that he feared.
'I want to be able to continue my life ', he said when he won the Prize of the journalists' Committee.
Drug trafficking in Sinalia is a 'way of life', as Mr Valdez said in an interview with TV last October.
The journalist must take on the job - or look stupid.
I do not want anyone to have to ask me where I was when a death was sown here - why did I not tell you what was going on? '
The staff of Mr Riodoctri need Valdez - a woman who wrecked like a doctor who wants a friend who always had the will and advice, who need a teacher who knows how to survive.
They had confidence in his routes.
He always used a panic.
He went to the opposite El Guyabo Bar and always sitting on the same table.
They are now asking whether the routes will suffer from his fate.
The deaths of the honourable Member have also led them to consider how best to do their work and stay alive.
'criminals do not like this if we deal with their women and children and their pure business activities, their secret skies.
They were excluded, Mr Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant a strong self-protection and a strong self-protection;
Confidence in their own fathers.
If you have the feeling that not everything is appropriate, you must stay absent.
The problem, according to the Riodoctrine journalist Andres Villarreal, is that 'the impression can be disappointed, and that is what happened in the case of Mr Javier'.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalia, nor do they apply to the Tamabai passports, Veracruz, Guerro and other Länder, where dangerous networks exist: Attractive smugglers, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operational environment is constantly changing.
Mobile telephony was not allowed to come into the room where safety training in Riodoctren was held, and it was revealed in the past that only espionage programmes sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had been deprived of wood protection from 40.
They had been ordered by the government of the State to guard the Riodoctre performance of the Riodoctrine in the quarterly building in the middle class in Culiacan.
Some journalists went half-heartedly to cut whether these two police officers were among the 50% which the Governor of the State did not consider to be reliable.
It was a long time since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside under the control of drugs drugs.
The provision of Mr Riodoctrine to the tune of this week was three after the end of the day.
The debt of the Nyrallaude Julio Cesar Evervez was killed in Sinala.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that government spending had focused on the city of the Governor.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, I simply replaced the public prosecutor's office, was tortured by a group of people.
There was no official information about who was abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: Everyone in the city knew that the food supplement was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the food supplement was registered in the name of an institutional revolution party (Pri), which has governed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
Recently, the pedestrian owners have been accused of corruption in cases that have attracted a lot of publicity.
Mr Villarrankoski asked the journalist to write on previous cases in the same place, one of which was' El Caco 'Guzmann' s boys managed to escape and avoid the rape of the army.
A few months earlier, the readers would have known that they would have received reliable information about the abduction of the Colombia in Valdez.
'In the past, we would have known what had happened ', say the 460th-year-old Villarorum, who has received the hotel because of its body structure,' El Flaco '.
'In this case, all our sources of information are a boy '.
The House of work in Valdez has been transformed into a reserve which preserves cold and roots against the persecution of journalists, who have acquired a new, unexpected task: They have become journalists in favour of freedom of the press.
The journalist, Mikam Ramirez, took note of a few villages next morning when he left a demonstration on behalf of the local Public Prosecutor, due to the murder of another journalist.
Salvador Adame cut off three days after the assassination of Valdez in the Western Michoacan State.
After disappearances, a body was incinerated which, according to the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, with the SOS Prince texts appearing in demonstrations and buildings.
Today, the Director-General, Mr Bojorquez, is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support to investigate the Valdez case.
On the day after the assassination of Valdez, Mr Ramirez met the Governor of Sinalia and accused the authorities of espionage and killing of journalists because they tell the truth.
He has subsequently asked him to be taken away from the government-related jungle, because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly said that organised crime surrounded by journalists in Mexico, permissible authorities and indifferent society.
In its final letter, Narkovski Valdez wrote that drug addicts kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in conjunction with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
'In Mexico, people are being silent by killing ', Mr Ramirez says.
Murders have a deteriorating effect.
No one will forget the deaths of Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of Tamayev border state six years ago.
The message from his body was signed by the Zealand cartel: "I am here for my written record."
His cut-off headquarters in the vicinity of the computer was the poultry and the deaf.
Some newspapers have decided to stop, such as the 'El Norte' newspaper in the north, following the assassination of Mr Böuah in March.
Some will continue to do so, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarz, on his front page, issued a message to drug cartels: "What do you want us?"
Some journalists have fled from their state or country as a whole.
It is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and we must always be careful.
Sometimes, criminals are looking in their hands, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Earinosa, who was murdered with four women in a housing in Mexico City in 2015, after he had fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra - which was supposed to become a poet at the time - admits that writing about drug trafficking is afraid.
'I came from a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell '.
A few moments ago, the journalists in Riodoctre were sitting in front of the supply on Friday, once the new number of newspapers had been completed.
19 people were killed in the shock between competing guerrillas and security forces at Mazati's coastline.
The war was accelerated, as promised by the cartel's messages in the region.
Journalists have illegal news on the Riodoctre website with intelligent telephone calls.
The EAGF was to be put off the next day.
Semens are on the brink - yet another amputation.
Mr Bojorquez looked at the police officers who watch the supply:
If they were afraid, they very well concealed it.
The delivery of Mr Riodoctre continued with the tradition of the murdered founder of the newspaper, with this massive formulation in which a man is showing a middle-slave for the whole of Sinala.
Mr Bojorquez says that you cannot even consider stopping the activity, "how can I stop the newspaper when our trainees asked to go down the street on the same day that Mr Javier was murdered?"
The Olympic project in Hannu Mann started with a tremendous setback - 'the location'.
The celebrations of Hannu Mann, who spent 39 April, remained short, since the professional farm started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the sinking period began in a catastrophic fashion when the Mann suffered in its flu.
It began with a long period of illness, nearly five weeks ago.
In May, in practice, it went completely out of the disease.
First there was a flung and, finally, a child's disease such as replacement, which I had to eat for antibiotics.
I was only able to make up 10% of the planned training.
I do not remember when I have been so dilemma for some time in the past.
It was a hard place when I was not able to take advantage of training, Mann tells Iltat Sire.
The theory incomes collapsed.
The World Cup in 2007 only received a training permit in the second week of June, as was shown by the KIHUS HGVs on 12 June.
In teaching, the sportsmen and women are slow down by a country whose speed is growing every three minutes.
After each three news, the journey is stopping for about ten seconds and the test will take the sportspeople out of the past with milk acidification.
Last autumn I had 32 minutes on land, but now I have only remained for 28 minutes.
It was against, and Mr Mann says so.
Better direction
After the initial difficulties, Mann says it was healthy.
I have made a wide range of peaceful aeronautical exercises in order to normalise the exchanges of material from the organs.
We now have a very good five-week period behind us.
It was also a week and a half of holiday flight.
I also had the opportunity to visit my family in the mould.
During the last period, Mann only participated in the competition of four world cup prior to the Malta homes.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening-up competition, when continental growth in the top sludge was 18.
Guidelines
The Mann and the Mayor, Petter Kukugaren, have submitted a training and competition plan up to February next year.
We are now looking for a different route from the last period.
After the collapse of the Ensiclus, Rukana would have the weekend of three World Cup.
In December, at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Rambou.
At the end of January, plans would still be in Seefell.
I hope that the name will then be found on the list of Olympic Games, as Mr Mann says.
The Olympic Games in Princio would already be the sixth winter Olympic Games of the career.
The most important thing now is to remain healthy, and Salt Lamke City in 2002 is to celebrate a noisy label in team competition.
Dinosury protected his enemy by disguised disguise.
At the outset, it seems to be a frightening statute.
The scientists have now revealed the initial findings of the inquiry into the size of the scoreboard found by the Canadian mining worker, which was so well maintained that experts call it Mona.
It had been so well maintained that researchers were even able to determine that their fantastic miracle was red arbitrary and had 'problematic past'.
According to the newspaper Curent Biberg, it has been best preserved in all times, with Dinossus and with representatives of the world's best laws.
Recently discovered fossil is a zero career, that is to say, at the middle of the milk period, between 11 and 112 million years ago.
Researchers find this conservation of phosphates extremely important.
According to the Nagorphic, the pandemarcated vegetable fat has been the best preserved in its species for all times.
It was found in the mining personnel in the Sturdy Millennium in Canada on 21 January 2011 and found Shailk Funk.
He found someone who did not seem to be a natural part of the expenses surrounding the surrounding region and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
A fossil found in Callio was sent to the Royal paloniological museum in Tyrrellin.
For six years, there was a fraudster of 1 100 km of loyalty.
We are now seeing the results of hard work.
'It is almost believing that it was swimming 'that the scientist, Caleb Brovina, is working as a scientist in the Royal Museum of Tyrrellin.
'it will remain in the history of science as Mona, one of the most beautiful and best maintained dinoses.
Research in NATO made it clear that dinosathy fed meat was probably a major threat to this plant cancer, even though it had a tanker and reminded us of the fantastic tanks.
It was disguised by its white tanker, who also protected it from the sacred and more electoral scenario, which still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to confuse its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinoses.
EUR 110 million of the ancient zero survival took place in May and is now on the cards in the Royal palonological museum in Tyrrellin.
According to Mark Mitchell, the scientists have given it the name of markuchell Mitchell, which was part of a dinosatol of over 7 000 hours.
Nodosury has remained so astonishing that Mitchell and international researchers have been able to determine the imagination and form of the body.
They discovered that in the animal world it was still protected by a general invasion in which the body is more and more electoral.
It was, however, a surprise, because Borealalalalalalalalia is considerably higher than the existing animals which have such an insult.
The conclusion of the report is that the dinosaic of meat eat it is so much as a means of survival rather than struggle.
The current animals, for example, have the same scenario, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, indicating that zero-resistance was seriously threatened.
The exposure to a large, highly specified dinosury tells us how dangerous the dinosator's dinoses were, Mr Brovaro says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosury reveals that it was a red art.
Scientists will continue to investigate a dosaic in order to draw conclusions from its life, including the content of its chocolate to find out what it swept in its last meal.
Researchers believe that they died in the river and driven into the sea where they sink on their seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as heavy as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are at present.
'There is a very important zero slaughter, because its chocolate has remained and has also been three-dimensional in its original form ', Mr Brok says.
'Since it appears to be nearly the same as it was in the early milk period.
To outline it does not require much imagination: If we tighten up a little eyes, it might almost be believed that it was sleeping '.
The Lithuania period was the era of teropool, huge two-fold, meat-eating dinoses.
Although their King, Tyrannosurch rex, that is, millions of years earlier in Borealalophota, its powerful predecessors may have been able to catch up with this anchored dinosury.
The predecessors of Mr Tyrannenury, for example, included Avilés threshold, about 11.5 metres of long faith monster.
The latest findings of researchers in Nodosury have been published in the Curent Biospital, believing that Borealopia was smuggled after their death and mutilated.
It was found in the mining personnel in the Sturdy Millennium in Canada on 21 January 2011 and found Shailk Funk.
According to museum, it has been the best preserved in the world from the tanks of Dinosury to the cattle and the tanks.
On average, there were five metres long and up to 1 300 kg.
There were two-and-a-half grass-roots grass-roots glass.
Scientists believe that this tanker-made cancer western Canada was going through until the western Canada went through it.
Its tanker has remained in small detail, especially in the maritime sphere.
Its fossil frameworks have remained so well that its cows remain in the dark of tanks.
Michael Gresho wrote in the Nepal that such retention is' as rare as the holiday profit.
The more astonishing it feels.
There is still a fossil lamb in its callopy spreading.
That is the right front in its village, five watchful stretches.
I can also count on the football base. "
How does a activist learn to answer the question: Who does the streets belong to?
Mrs Ferrell was deeply shocked at 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier.
At that time, he saw the message from his reader:
"The police killed a young person who was just 18 years old and his bodies are still on the street."
He was astonished to note that nobody else had delivered the same information on his cancer, which is why he closed Mr Florbou and opened Mr Twitter.
His analysis of time had many reinstatements from the user, Mrs TheePharoh.
The name of the charterer belongs to St Ferguson, who lived in Louise in real time for the death of Michael Brown, who had shot his unarmed 18th-year-old black Browin Ferguson in the state of Missouri.
The user concerned had also posted an image of Mr Browin's unleashed body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
'It is incredible ', Mrs Ferrell thought.
But the death was nothing new to him and his community.
He made his telephone out of his telephone, and when he returned to Twitter later this evening, people were told that they are gathering their eyes to Drive.
The users posted images of people who were closed and amazed by the police and of the man who claimed himself to be the father of Mr Browin, who in his cold cold read: "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son."
Mrs Ferrell followed a real-time video in which the police were standing in front of demonstrators with a dream.
He also says that he has seen a video in which another police officer has misled the screen and rumoured: 'I kill you all...'
"This is not normal", Mrs Ferrell recalls her words.
'it was not the kind of murder we have already used to and could be described as a typical one.
At that time I was familiar with the villages.
I was angry and I was too. "
He stored a return flight for the next day.
The machine fell at the second evening, and Mrs Ferrell went to apply for her six-year-old girl's father's father's faith and decided that they would leave Ferguson next morning.
With regard to what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years, a documentation 'Whitehead Strebraltar' has been produced, which has received its first delight in cinemas from 11.8.2017.
Film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss and of strength and perseverance from the point of view of local people who left the streets to demand answers.
When Mrs Ferrell moved on to Ferguson with her daughter who has fallen into the krone, they have again had a debate on what is to be black and under what conditions', who had spoken countless times before this morning.
'Why do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for what they believe in 'Ferrell' remembering his daughters?
'We are going to Ferguson because the police killed a nineteen-year-old boy and that is not correct '.
'I could not ignore my daughter, Mrs Ferrell said later. '
'The events of today are... the end of events in the past.
My daughter is entitled to know and grow.
He must be able to activate and organise, but he must also feel black-handed about the different realities and circumstances of life and know what we need to do to liberalise, liberalise ourselves.
Although I have fortunately been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
It seems to me to be detrimental to him if I protected him from reality '.
Their first blockade in Ferguson was the Florissant Road, located on the head of police station, which became the place of activists when they were waiting for information on how the case was handled and finally found out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
There Mrs Ferrell and her daughter went to help local entrepreneurs who made lunch packages.
They fled the lunch into the ballot boxes and distributed them to demonstrators.
Mrs Ferrel gradually began to take a new approach to activists.
'It was at the University of Missouri that Mrs Ferrell was chairman of the organisation of nursing students belonging to minorities, who then focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
'I had no experience of organisation.
In some ways it did. "
A week later, Mrs Ferrell met in the afternoon demonstration with Sabavih Folayan, a doctor of documentation.
Mrs Folayan said that she and Mrs Lucas Alvaradop 'Farrar simply wanted to say' what was happening.
Mr Ferrer said: 'Do you really want to tell us what is happening, or do you want to use the story that you can use?'
The suspicion was based on the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who simply wanted to benefit from its difficulties and tenacity.
'We heard that the people born and grown in Ferguso did not have a common voice ', and Mrs Folayan recently said in an interview:' We wanted to do things differently '.
Mr Folayan had already contacted Damo David, the David David, who is familiar with his tactics with prisoners sentenced to death.
The Davi Meeting led Mr Ferrelli to leave the project together with six other local people, which followed events in the years following the shooting of Brown.
'This is not a documentation in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk ', Mr Davis says.
'I was most concerned about how local people are to be presented in film because I am presented in the same way '.
According to Folayan, the intention was not to concentrate on the experience of Mr Ferrer, because it was hoped that 'the grass-roots leader' was not a question of 'but of the Community', but Mrs Ferrell proved to be the most open-ended.
That is why the documentation is surprising about the private aspects of the life of Mrs Ferrelli, such as love and marriage.
'I feel quite inferior, Ferrell laughter, telling us how it seemed to be seen for the first time.
'but I understand that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability '.
Furthermore, Mrs Ferrelli's story once again and reinstates the role of black queer women in the wider Bradad Lives Matter.
The movement was born in the social media, after the police had shot the black teenager Trayvin Martin in 2012, and two out of three founders of the movement were identified with querieter identity.
The leadership of black queeral women has maintained the whole movement, Mrs Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black women have had to endure everything. "
Mr Folayan agrees: 'The movement actually sustains black women, including many queeries'.
He stresses, however, that Mrs Ferrelli was not 'self-consciously' documented because of her queerre identity.
'he mobilised energy ', Mr Folaya says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that she was in the front line, and women in the queeriet live on many subjects and have a lot of fears.
His energy is conveyed from the White Paper. "
The news teams have been leaving Ferguson for a long time, but there is still a tension between the Community and the police.
Mrs Ferrer still has two and a half years to go and sentenced the motorway to the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate in his homeland is short and concise: 'The divide'.
Yet he is still counting on the slogan that he learns three years ago on the streets of Ferguson:
'We have a duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only destroy our coffee '.
Harmony: Artists create formulations on ChelMann's DNA
In New York, the Frimandallery has shouldered plant - white, black and black plants, which, from a more accurate point of view, can see uniformity.
These thirty works are formulae from the artists, Heavanweg-Hague, based on DNA samples in Chelpling Mann and slump.
The Management sent samples about the prison of Fort Leaventhos, where he carried out 35 years' judgment, which was condemned to leaving the diplomatic electricity classified as secret on the WikiLeaker site.
The Deweg-Hague case was opened at 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Deweg Hague and Mananning, which combines technology, information technology and skills in its work with a woman and a pioneering dissident whose prison sentence, Barack Obama, on the third day of his term of office.
On the basis of his genetic data, Department Hague analysed the Mann DNA and created 30 formulations, which are a steel, albeit somewhat theoretical, position on the form of DNA data, ambiguity and interpretation of the causes and identity.
Chelplanning, its names Bradley Ededo, has openly reported that he has been smoking for women since race; he was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences, including infringements, computer interception and theft.
The Manningi sentenced to prison was just one image: A rape, a black white mafias, in which the invasion is situated in the car driver's car, and he is in a position to withdraw the box that became his merchant.
In 2015, Mrs Deweg-Hague had a very welcome Stranger Vigence project, which she carried out in 2012.
He created formulations on the basis of criminal data, for example DNA data on cigarettes and pumps and created pictures of what the people concerned could have shown.
The artist then received e-mail from the Mzaline.
'they interviewed Chelm Mann and needed a picture of 'Deweg-Hague'.
Mr Mann was not able to visit or describe him in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsean and asked whether he was interested in making the Mann DNA wording.
The artists and his imprisonment were surprised to become correspondents, who wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even carried out a Suppeaker Images report, described by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which President Chelsean's judgment would have been relaxed and he would be able to look at the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened the judgment of Manning only a few days after the publication of the Sarsus, which was a fortunate coincidence after seven years of national military prison.
It is also impressive that this exhibition should be opened at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against databases and sexual soldiers and invent new ways of strengthening the powerful divisions that he had actually to alleviate.
Deweg Hague believes that 'everything has its purpose'.
In his opinion, the artist 's statement and the great nomination of Mann, which is at the heart of the family, asks for the end of the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based'.
The opposite is true of the Mann DNA: A long list of Cs, GMO and Al books written in the lead books.
This combination of 200 letters - or sledgehammer, as used by the artist - with a combination of Deweyne Hague would like to illustrate how similar we are all, at least in our biology.
'I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our gene gene gene gene gene gene and that genetic engineering is very personal and open to interpretations', 'Deweg-Hague', and that his videowork will also be under discussion from 2007.
'DNA says countless stories: 30 of them are on the table. '
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: By ignoring the Mann and Deweyg Hague System.
That is where the hair of Mann is flourishing from prison like King Kong, in hand.
'if they are silent, they have won '.
'Never. '
"The text is the letter I received from Mann," artists from Philadelphia.
'It is so impressive that I will continue to be able to cold colours'.
Contrary to what was described in the SARS, Manning has not yet seen an exhibition, and when Manning comes to the place he welcomes the plants based on his own genetic data, as well as the sampling of demonstrators in the middle.
It is deliberate, as everyone else has done in this debate: The Mann DNA period, for example, has been written to the lead, which is like his duration (157.5 cm).
"Plants were on the table in the past, but I wanted to bring a number of people into them", Deweg-Hague says.
'I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsean, which was also behind his liberalisation '.
The professor of the Northweses University and the staff of the Oxford University are considered to be suspected of the murder.
The police reveal that they have launched massive searches in order to find a worker at the University of Northweses and Oxford who are suspected of falling a man into die in a chicagolic housing.
The Cook documents show that arrest warrant was issued on Monday from Wyndham Laos, 42, and Andrew Warrensen, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornellang, which has been arrested for the murder of the first instance, without the possibility of liberalising guarantees.
According to documents, Cornellanjo, 26, died since he had been interfered with several times.
According to a local information published by the Chicago police force, the body was found on 27 and 7.2017.
The police deprived of the Grand Plaza honey found a victim with many hostilities in their bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornellanzang has been dead on the ground and wood is being investigated, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Laos has been working as a microbiological and immuniciological academic professor at the Nortwester University since 2007.
In a statement sent by an e-mail, the deputy deputy deputy in the university's social relations, Mr Alan K. Cubbkhope, said that Laos is now on administrative freedom and is denied access to the championship of the Northwesis University.
'This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and the Northweses University will help to investigate ', as Mr Cubbbbbbbbeni wrote.
Warre is a parent in financial management at the University of Oxford.
In a statement sent by the University and Somert Collegen e-mail, the University and Somern, it says: 'We have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are prepared to help the US authorities in every way possible'.
In addition, it was reported that colleagues in Warrenter were shocked and hoped that they will give up.
Mr Anthony Gugliell, the head of the Chicago police force, said that he calls for suspects to be given to the authorities seriously.
'the police have an idea of their location, and we will keep on looking for our search ', Mr Guglielm said.
Mr Gugliell says that local, regional and national authorities will help in the quest for suspects.
He told us that the police had received a telephone from the Grand Plaza building, which had received a vague suggestion that there had been some 1008 incidents in housing.
The police described the incident as horrifying.
Mr Gugliell says that it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or in the past.
He said that the safety marks revealed that Laos and Warre had been in the building.
'We believe that Professor Lamthau and the victim had a relationship ', Mr Gugliell says.
The leadership group in Grand Plaza published the following information to the inhabitants: 'The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background to the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence'.
A man threatened to explode Islamic book-keeping and 'kills black fever' in London.
'I am not an anti-Muslim, I am Catholic ', was sentenced to the police.
Messrs must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39th-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to explode Islamic book trade in London and 'kill everything black spot'.
According to the Institute, David Matters was sentenced, among other things, to serious harassment.
According to the police, they were alarmed by the book trade staff on 23 May.
According to the staff, "man was threatening to explode the book-keeping and kill black fever."
After threats, the suspected was left to trade.
Mauritat was resisted when he reconciled the police with the threat.
The threat was not related to what happened in the book trade.
The authorities noticed that Messrs had fallen in the same way as the suspected transactions in book-keeping, as the police spokesman said.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am Catholic, Mr Messatt said to the police in interview.
A man must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay the legal costs of approximately EUR 690 and EUR 85, or approximately EUR 95, for the victims.
According to the information provided by Mr Jardi, a number of offences are not reported.
'WADA's road map will be completed in the near future '- Vice-Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Vitakorn.
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Vitagnet, has said that Russia will shortly complete the WADA road map measures to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSA.
'part of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with the UKAD in the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in this respect ', Mr Mugabe said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister has commented on the second part of the WAD road map, which lays down the conditions for the repatriation of RUS DA competences, and the second part of the road map was recently published on the website of the organisation.
According to Mr Mussa, it does not contain any concern for Russia.
'everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to the WADA in the near future.
One of the points of the road map, however, requires the Russian Anti-Doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged share of Russian sport in doping.
This was said: "Research is under way because our anti-doping system has recognised the failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit what did not exist '.
Mr Mutko's words were all that was said about the statement made by the President of the Russian independent public Anti-Doping Commission, Mr Vitakorn.
Earlier on the same day, Mr Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian sports edge, admitted that there were problems in Russian antidoping bodies, and 'we have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We do not intend to approve the report unconditionally, but he added.
In November 2015, when the doping scandal had revealed, WADA imposed an end to the RUS Doping Strategy in Russia.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under international experts and UKAD supervision.
Mr Olivier Niggli, the Director-General of WAD, visited RUS DA in July, said that the organisation was on the right track to restore powers.
As a sceptical Finnish organisation, there is no evidence of the health benefits of electoral packaging '.
The British organisation doubts the benefits of the maternity packaging of Finnish styles.
Among other things, the BC and Guardian tell us that Lullatemala Trentin, which is fighting against fathers, prohibits the use of its own prospectuses in maternity packaging in Britain.
The distribution of voting packages for all women who are pregnant will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in certain regions.
According to Lulling, there is no evidence that maternity packaging would reduce the risk of deaths.
Fatality is an unquestionable madness.
Lullafield Trentin is the British health authorities' expertise in the field of a safe dream.
We will no longer allow them to be formally presented, because that would give us the impression that we recommend this product, the organisation informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two thousand people born.
According to Lulling, the good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of injuries.
Giving every family a box could be one factor.
However, this cannot be said without doubt, as the Director-General of the Lullakas trusts said.
We are concerned about the marketing of maternity packages as products that reduce child mortality and teaching.
The electoral packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
Packaging contains various materials, such as childhood clothes.
This year there are 53 products in packaging.
Packaging itself is a bad label to which the child can be thrown into sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, all safety standards are met by its boxes.
Lulling Trentin, for his part, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullah trusts, packaging can be the best option if there is no framework or surface.
The organisation recommends that packaging should only be used for day-to-day dreams and that it should stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pet animals out of packaging and ensuring that it does not grow or dirty.
Vikukul has once again fled from Japanese animal swine fever.
The Japanese animal welfare staff are looking for a black cargo.
The staff have been surprised by the speed at which they have swiftly expelled and expelled again in two weeks' time.
On Tuesday morning, a kitchen herd from the Shibkawa animal story in Okama in western Japan.
The Turkish cameras revealed that there was a disappearance of the animal swine fever through the headquarters.
It will not die immediately because it causes food around animal meal, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works in animal swine fever.
A 35th-year-old cargo is a naïve, 550s and approximately a metre long.
Mrs Yamane describes cattle as silence and pet.
In the event of secondary conditions, pedestrian can travel freely within the supply area.
Animal swine fever has not received eye-eye discoveries of kilometre.
The last carp in Konan took place in other weeks.
Mrs Yamane discovered the route of 150 metres away from animal swine fever.
I noticed it on the way to animal meal.
I went to my car and asked my colleagues for help, as Mrs Yamane said.
It will be able to cope more quickly than we could ever imagine.
These scandals help to avoid Uberg errors.
Arrett Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his network trade scandal, but the questions did not work.
The answers were often vague, pointless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that questionnaires were anonymous, some of the workers were sceptical about them.
'This questionnaires were simply not consistent or objective ', as Mrs Errett says: Her hair-care company is concentrating on network trade, with 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to external assistance.
More and more new staffing management firms have come onto the market, which will help other firms to find out how their employees can work.
They develop and add software that can measure the commitment of employees, and companies can submit questionnaires and demographic groups and provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct contact with the government.
"Own health may be followed by applications such as Stravan and Fitbitbin, but where is the Fitraud 'ask the founder and delivery director of the Glintsky, Jim Barnet, which offers companies certification programmes to measure the commitment of employees?
Mrs Errett has spent three years on the Glint software, who says she has had a deeper vision of the ideas and feelings of his staff.
This programme can carry out swift questionnaires and votes for certain daughters, and it can draw up a map which can be seen in one eye, with the worker 's dissatisfaction and the weakest assessments of the leaders, which have enabled Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realised that they must monitor the culture of jobs, so that they do not become the next Uberia; they have disappeared around the transport company since the former worker wrote in their grievances about a culture of harassment and punishment for those who speak of problems.
For slaughterhouses such as Glint, such negligence is an attractive business.
Company management, regulation and conformity are a worldwide area of activity which, according to the Let 's website, can rise to more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
The Colorado story, which helps companies to detect and prevent irregularities, was increased earlier this year when Uverbert's reputation became a trip.
Converciliation has almost 600 clients, including, for example, Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Ubert.
Like Mrs González González, companies will be able to carry out regulated questionnaires, collect answers in confidence in real time and map out problematic areas.
Furthermore, workers can unapprehensively report on inappropriate behaviour by means of a textiles message.
And if the director is sceptical, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
'public opinion has sidelined the authorities', says the founding father and the delivery director, Patrick Quinla.
He reminds us that if a company treats its workers badly or acting in an ethical way, the consequences may be expensive, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can begin to boycott a company and it can also lose workers and become a challenge.
The "peak food chain" has more than 25 000 employees at 500 stations; it has spent Converbal over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
In the past, it was customary that if the worker wanted to report the problem, he first had to explain the telephone number or e-mail address which was able to notify the headquarters, then he had to make an official appeal and hope that it will be taken seriously.
'it was often a frightening and unpleasant experience ', says,' Mr Yames Vitrano, the Legislative Director of Ruverdam, who said that it was difficult to monitor the complaints made by the workers.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
'I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the reality of the worker ', Mr Vitrano, who is leading the risk management group in Reverend Stockesdam.
"At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to working relations."
According to Quinland, companies started to take an even more serious view of ethics, values and the commitment of employees following the collapse of Arthur Andersen in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the help of the social media that companies realised that they could no longer hinder public investigation.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control", Mr Quinla says.
Glins and Converbal provide their software as a service that is regularly charged with its use.
It is a business model that the capital investors have accepted, it is an opportunity, and both Glinl and Converciliation have support for capital investors.
In February, Converbal collected USD 10 million from companies such as Saphire Ventures and Tola Capitalin, which collected capital totalling USD 47 million.
Glinl received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Partner in November and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investment is no surprise, given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, employees expect more of their jobs.
In competing markets such as Pilayer, good wages are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
'employees are more committed to the success of the enterprise if they take up and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding ', says Nina McQueen, the leader of LinkudIndia, who is responsible for rewarding and prosperity workers.
Investors will receive profits when companies succeed, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third party road tools promise to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the culture of site culture, information on the commitment of employees is important;
But it is pointless if action is not taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if there is no change quickly or nothing to change, disappointment can reduce the commitment of employees.
'If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to hold four thousand debates', the Director-General of the Director-General of the Executive Director, Mr Kotter International, who has seen too much trust on the part of companies in mere collection of information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to consider whether they were consulted.
And is there any difference between them?
If the company does not care about them, why should they pass on the company? "
According to Mrs Errett, today, Madiscar is carrying out staff questionnaires on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glind.
Once Mrs Errett had gathered a feedback from frustrated workers in decision-making and the quality of communications, she was able to make changes to the domain and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Mr Ruessen will understand his employees better and hope that greater understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an area that is known to be the great turnover of workers.
'if a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers', then Mr Vitrano will say.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
Without clients there will be no business. "
In Sweden, 20-year-old man is suspected of encrypting his unsubcontracted female neighbour, it says TT.
The woman who lives in Gothenburg had come out of chocolate at home when he had discovered outside his window of window at the end of the narrow.
According to a woman, the cynical camera described housing.
An irritated woman was drinking in another room.
Once a woman had arrived to review the situation, it was first a crossroads, but it will soon be recounted.
A man who is suspected of describing the 20-year-old man has admitted that he has died of a woman.
He said, however, that he was only dead of a woman's face.
The video described at the end was removed and the police had not managed to restore it as proof.
In the hearings, a man has admitted his actions, but has banned his perpetrators.
He was right to say that he love his neighbour 'absolutely mad'.
According to TT, the newspaper offices are charged with a man.
Teachers are demanding more lights during the autumn negotiations.
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, as Olli Likud said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holidays highlights the difference, as he points out.
We do not have the possibility of concluding agreements which, in some way, do not involve holiday convictions.
In the field of reunification, agreements will only be reached once the documents of the private sector have been signed and an increase rate is clear.
The recent forecast is that, for example, working conditions for the OAU have been agreed in January.
The lady has not yet revealed the key objectives.
The newspaper is also the chairman of the educated negotiating organisation, Juko.
My final point is this: Lomarah increases the differences in merit development.
According to the OAS, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of the public sector is deteriorating while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the newspaper, fixed-term holidays will further exacerbate the differences in merit.
In Finland, we must determine how many teachers there can be for one teacher.
In addition, the OAC points out that the equality of primary education must be guaranteed, because the differences between the weakest and the weakest days are increasing all the time.
According to the organisation, the educational farms are deteriorating and the disparities between both pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the players in Bruin when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one day.
It will soon be eighteen p.m. this evening, and a group of UCLAs have remained on the other side of the wall.
Some have gone out of their game, and their backs are stepping up after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this jungle for a few minutes is the outbreak of the Middle Ages.
The players studying in the summer courses of the University will return to their homeland after three hours of exercise, and the next morning they will meet half of seven WasSerman's football centre.
"Next three days, the next three days will be the punishment for these verbs", the Bruin Executive, Jim Mora, says a little before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The change was aimed at reducing the number of day-to-day train drivers, but it has extended them - at least Friday, when the final tests will take place.
That is why the first carpets of UCLAs began in more than seven evening, and it was difficult to find a space for players in any other way.
Limiting the gathering gatherings one day means that there are more working days, which began nearly a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six-day Westwoods, while training is being conducted in parallel with the summer courses.
They are to be held 18 times before 20 August, when the actual preparation for the opening of the period begins: In September, UCLA will be paragraph A & M.
Mr Mora says he is in favour of changing the rule of the NCAA, even though it made the timetable of players even more stringent.
'We are burying them a great deal for three or four days and it is very challenging ', Mr Mora says.
"But players are prepared to work; they are fine games.
I believe that the situation will be made easier when we get to Saturday, and then we will have more time.
It is not easy, given the direct prospect of a stable stock zone and the Lussky Center, a high-quality hotel which has already been bombed in football flights flying over the paint ball.
Bruin players are due to change hotel at the weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the period when bad ones are available outside.
'We have safety arrangements', Mr Mora says.
'The concern is that people can guard against bad weather and describe video exercises there, which is not an exaggerated concern.
A great deal of money is paid for the video described by Mr Harbour.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We will do our best.
I am not going to silence myself too much.
We have a plan. "
Freedom in Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will take place in Central Africa in Rwanda, the winner of which is already seen as clear.
Paul Kuhne is officially seeking his third period, but in practice he has been influencing the leadership of the country since 1994.
At the time, the RPF ended the genocide organised by extremists.
We were the commander of the RPF.
We have been criticised for murdering the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, we will be able to try, because the two-fold constitution of the presidency was changed.
In Rwanda, however, we also have a genuinely held leader.
In his time there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment.
In addition, Kagama has played a major role in reconciling a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the correct model for African states.
But we too have promised more freedom for their people once the country has been raised.
It could be a good moment to start now.
Florence boycotts are fighting the currency by intensifying the inspection of faxes.
Mr Fatuzzo intends to send possible currencies to independent inspectors more and more frequently and to present the results with an initial article, which was announced by the world's largest social network on Thursday.
On its website, the company published a statement that it is starting to use updated electronic learning to identify the currencies, which could be sent to the fax inspectors and the results could be published by an initial article.
Mr Fatuzzo has been criticised for being one of the biggest protagonists of the currency, and many people think that the currencies had an impact on the outcome of the American presidential elections in 2016.
This topic has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with currencies before the presidential elections in May and Germany, which is preparing for the elections in September, is supporting the plan to smoke social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, in a separate statement published in Germany, Mr Fatuzzo stated that the inspection of faxes is being tested in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
'people want to see which stories do not pass over the seat of independent inspectors, and they also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what read and distribute ', Sara Su, the Director-General of Florence, wrote in the company's memorandum.
He added that Mr Fatuzzo will continue to test the relevant articles and make other changes to his news-cancer test in order to reduce the currencies.
The sarcash description was born: A holiday.
The small birthday in the Greek county of Khent is now known from the Squeeze music stoning and Margaret Thatcher as a piracy in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history, and now, on the window of the river of Bewl, this is the subject of a sarchitecture book written by Jamie Rhodes, an anonymous writer in the old documents.
'I think it is a good thing to be able to investigate the text written by more than 300 years ago ', Mr Rhodes says so eloquently.
'I know the personal connection when I look at the letter in my hand '.
The Rhodesh book, the A Castle English, reveals the story of the families who live in embryos from the Middle Ages to the Caucasus: Isac Lenkiewicz, amputo Smith, William Exley, Beckösky or Isaberg.
This is not the first architecture in Rhodesh; in 2014, he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Overseas Storate, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Code.
'I was cynically moved to see the light of a letter in the book, 'I had written a double agent for the Chechens in the 17th Century', Mr Rhodes.
'it was his finger!
And books imported from smoking, because at that time they were used as lights.
Three centuries later, that brings a firm feeling that he is on the ground.
I love archives! '
A writer who wrote to old documents was allowed to live on holiday for nearly four months with the support of the Numberg Trentin Foundation and the English National Science Council, which seemed too good to be true, admitting that he did not dwell on a slightly longer label than would have been desirable.
He went on to spend days on the Speakers' new 'fortress, archives, archives and rare feedingstuffs, such as shelves on wall and centuries of bottlenecks in power.
He evaded the old bird with rubbbbbbbbish and screening and discussed with forest guards, wood feedingstuffs and sometimes also with image artists.
I would like to see him write. "
The closer history of the past is quite unknown, because the lunch was only completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation, only after the death of the last herd, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Mr Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were only just starting the architecture, which will tell us that archives had been kept for hundreds of years under the same method: By taking everything extra to bathing.
There were daily books in the archives, letters from the driving force of the English empire and maps of who owned what, "imagine that the land disputes are stupid", but "here families lost even one of the homes.
It was remembered that it would be '.
Some of the book's stories are moving from holiday to English history, such as The Labourer, which tells a man who will soon be joining the English Speaker rebellion in 1381.
'The Famassment of Kent and Sussex 'says that there was a black hole in 1380 in the year 1380', Mr Rhodes will say.
The winter of England began in the same region, and it was borne in mind that the rebellion can begin with a black hole.
Perhaps these events are interrelated? '
Other outbreaks of the book are closely linked to the history of lunch, such as The Priest, as a seven-year seven years of religious cleansing in England.
On the other hand, the smugglers, Arthur Darrelli, are telling us that he was against his own squabbles in the gun (it was discovered years later when his wounds were opened).
Darrells are in Rhodesh's favourite family, which appears to have been a great deal of joke, and they continually had to get into debt and buy things that they could not afford.
The Darrelli men solved their debt by going to women with wealthy women, and I see them as complicity who were able to annex the stumbling block.
Now, Mr Rhodes is looking for new book-keeping experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a sarcash description of an improvement at the beginning of the twentieth century, which is no longer just a reliable tonne.
I have a special place in my heart.
'It was sad to leave ', he says.
'I would not have liked to go back to this dilemma of evil '.
The worst intermediaries to Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has greatly deteriorated, commented on Thursday by the NATO Secretary-General, Jalvantentenberg.
Sitenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I think it can be said that the relationship between NATO and Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, as Mr Segtenberg said in an interview with the CNN.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
However, since the illegal integration of Krimi, in 2014 and in the Russian Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Satenberg, however, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from escalating and a new cold war.
Before the comments made by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, were able to say that the relationship between the United States and Russia was even at a dangerous level.
Mr Trump invited us to thank the countries for their bad colours in the Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshire will stop - revitalisation against Anthony Joshua will not happen.
The long-standing heavy SARS World War, Vladimir Klitshire, will stop his career.
Mr Klitshka, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
The Olympic Games in the Atlantic in 1996 took 69 professional holidays, winning 64 times.
He was in possession of different Multifaces between 2000 and 02 and 200615.
Mr Klitko lost his career two final matches.
Tyso Fury found him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshire met with Anthony Joshua on the stadium of Wembley, and lost 11 in a hurricane.
Joshua and Klitshire were expected to be confronted with a renewal in Las Vegasi in November.
However, Mr Klitch found no motivation.
I was deliberately using a few weeks' decision to distance myself adequately from the Wembley match, Mr Klitshire said in his statement.
As an amateur and professional sportsperson, I helped with everything I dreamt of and now I want to begin my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful crossroads.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at Mr Klitshman's arguments for his video.
Mr Bernd Bönne, various Deputies in Klitshire, told us in a statement that the decision to end was difficult for Klitshire.
However, he has always emphasised that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, as Mr Bönne said.
Since 2009, Henya Panettier has been following the American actor.
Parish has a child, a daughter born in 2014.
The grandfather of Klitshire, Vitali, is also the former world champion of pregnancy.
Between 2008 and 12 debts dominated the MMalta Conclusions at the same time.
The Finnish Finnish weather is subjected to conditions: "Hate from fires."
Minna Niktien has suffered under conditions during the summer's external border.
Minna Nikavia has had problems with circumstances.
Wind and cold have exported a woman from the fires.
There are instability in the London Mexico.
Minna Nicholen is talking about a weather.
The circumstances have been this window against Minna Nika.
I do not want to blame, but it was incomprehensible that I did not even get the small squeezes moving properly, as Mr Nikanen said after the cat in Innsbrucas.
I have been competing and travelling here for the umpteenth time, and I have never experienced the same variation of subsidies in this place, as Mr Nikanen said in Pauvo Nurm Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to stay on the shelf, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercise, as Mr Nikanen said in the Kaleva Kurds.
This was also mentioned on Thursday in London.
It has been quite a challenge to get the technology to grips with, whether it is cold-beds or what.
It has been cold and wind and exported from fires.
There is no point in consuming energy in bad conditions.
Thanks to his 455 possessions, he got to the Mexico.
The outside world has gone 445.
In London, the pace is not the same for everyone.
We must be moderate and look forward to a better wind.
The aim is to exceed Friday's map of 460.
What else do they get abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I have had a joke in the face and the technology has been stalled.
Surely we should have done the same now.
Normally, they have been able to do their homework, and now they have been under control.
What would be the extraction?
25% of heat.
A small wind will also take place, as long as it is a stable one.
The experienced expansionist was shocked by politicians in Ylu: 'We have no room for manoeuvre now or for many years'.
In spite of the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilan must keep up in the wretched and weighing up the government's budget, warn Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing for decades.
He says that there is no room for division.
In 2015, the lifetime from Virta was interviewed in Wednesday's Wednesday's Christmas.
State budgets for next year are just beginning.
Recently, pipeline political proposals such as the increase in guaranteed pensions, the reduction in the car tax and the promotion of electrical wheels in Virtanen will be seen as electoral speeches.
They say that the elections are about to start because, when 10% of the national budget is financed by additional debts, we do not have any division either now or for many years.
I even think it is disappointing to talk about division when debts are cancelled, Mr Virtanen said to Youth.
Mr Virtanen emphasised that all debt is debt for children.
Virksta has a long experience in preparing state budgets: In 1978, he started as budget lines in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Secretary of the Budget and budget headquarters.
Last time, before retirement, he was the head of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Policy.
In an interview with the top, Mr Virtanen pointed out that the 3% growth now predicted is likely to be temporary.
All those who predict that this is a piece of work, starting from next year to a visa, and Finland expects 1% growth for dozens.
Washington changes the rules on permanent residence permits.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that the rules of the Cardi Statute will be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants over 50 000 years, tighten up the requirements of temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
New rules have been proposed by republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
'this law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens in other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The beneficiaries of the new application process are those who know English and can live for themselves and who have skills of benefit to our economy, Mr Trump said in the media.
The husband of the Danish Queen does not want to be in the same place as the Queen.
Prinst Henrik does not want to be buried with King Margareta.
In April, Henrik and King Margareta were described.
King of Denmark, King Margareeeta, 77, and that wife Henrich, 83, will not be swimming each other.
Traditionally, the headquarters in Denmark have been thrown into the same place.
The House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be disturbed by the Roskjaden Church, when he reported on Thursday.
According to the BTT, the reason for this is that the prime minister's dissatisfaction with his role in the UK family.
It is no secret that the prime minister in the Danish monarchy, Mr Lene Belletandon, has commented in the press.
The decision for the installation that he should not be squeezed alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of his not being treated on an equal footing with his spouse.
The hotel is that the Queen has for a long time been aware of the wish of his wife to see the decision.
At the end of this honey: The car was on the motorway.
There was a unmarried partner and two small children in village.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive insurance if the other party is not pursued.
The accident occurred with the Keimolang report.
The Archbishop from the III building site.
On Tuesday, his family has been survived by a car accident.
Tomma, his unmarried partner, Mr Riina, and two small children from the Partnership were driving on the motorway to the Keimolang by giving Hämel a hand.
From the window of the III to Hämetel, a white car driven to drive the family into a car, Tommuns tells.
The car would have come to the end, according to Tomm.
At the same time, the car was translated by Mr Jarrut and translated by Tomani.
The car of the family collapsed at a tough rate.
Two small children were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than three years old, another less than three years old.
Apparently, it was quite a good joke when nothing happened to us.
No one in the world was even driving us down, even though there was heavy traffic there.
The accident took place around 5.20 p.m.
According to Tomm, no one stopped their creatures and the family waged an emergency centre.
They went out of the car by their own means.
The staff of Ambuls and the rescue facility came and the family was checked.
The car went to the home.
Tommunto tells him and the unmarried partner that they had a small income, and they were able to receive smile aid to buy a car a few years ago.
Without information from another car, the family does not receive the money from insurance.
That is why the family wishes to see eye-eye witnesses on the car which led the family to disappear.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children into infection and work without it, Mr Tomani says.
Tomma saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the twenty-first century.
In his view, the start of the car registration number was a sight.
If the guilty is not persuaded, I do not know how we are economically sacrificed, we are still going to have to count every hectare.
Tomalia hopes that those who have seen what has happened or who know something about it are connected with the police.
The police force in the Austrian country and the rescue facility in the Central Highlands confirmed that they had had had to do with the accident on Tuesday evening.
The title and the headline were corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally said in the drink, another car did not come to the destination of the future, but was driving the family into a car car.
The proposal steered by Mr Lova Jessen deals with human relations by means of humour - the revealing of the Mage theatre is seen on Friday and Saturday.
Lota Jesalem, who is from Koukieu, brings his especial guidance to the 'Mage' theatre.
The music theatre is a music theatre of past human relations and inadequate.
According to Mr Lova Jessen, it still leaves a good idea.
The subject is being dealt with by means of humility.
He says that he is not going to wake up to the unfortunate feelings.
The rotating summer theatre proposal has, according to Mr Järm, been carried out with a quick budget and with a great young heart.
The name of the proposal calls upon us to consider what people reveal when they look at the new person.
Will he perhaps take a role, or will the second door be approaching?
Juoneton's proposal confuses fax and physics.
He has both guided and dramatically dragged the proposal.
He is also responsible for the choices.
This proposal is made up of the texts of the working party and is not incomprehensible.
The Director-General believes that, although the proposal goes back on the ideas of young people, it talks of all ages.
He stresses that the revealing of the Itostlander does not directly report on his own relationship or on the human relationship of the working party.
Fax and fith are confused.
I am sure that my own section is conveyed from the presentation.
I do not think that human relations are bad, but neither do I think that the human relationship, especially the partnership, is a good condition.
Many teachers learnt from their fortunate parents.
Anyone who believes that the Itospel reveals a timely picture of adults who live in Finland.
According to him, many have learned a great deal from human relations with parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least the need to listen to itself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The proposal appears to have Minea Lindng, Niklas Raué and Otto Roca.
The working party also includes a puppet, Eella Snellman.
Music reconciliation is Jesta and Roca.
Love of the theatre was attacked in Koukianta.
Lova Jesaidea, from Koukieu, 26, is studying the theatre as the head of the phrase 'theatre' in the Taideacademy of Turkey.
There are two years behind and another motive before us.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun over the years of Koukiang.
The flora of swine kilometres has been a assistant in the theatre of Koukian and has shown, among other things, Ylioping teams in Helsinki and, most recently, in Linnateatter in Turkey.
Guidance has begun to be of increasing interest.
Last week in Helsinki, the discovery of a discovery on the Narri scene was first received.
In future, at least in a town of Jewish learning in Turkey, a sustainable proposal has also been seen for some 45 minutes.
At 4.8 a.m., at 4 a.m., at 4 a.8.8 a.m., the disclosure of a censorship of censorship in Koran '.
For a year, the Finnish Olympic Games recovered the magnificent mobile crossroads - a cameras collapsed.
A few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Je Lamy.
When in a couple of days, the world rotated over the last couple of years and divided its dream from the Olympic Games.
The dream was realised in 2002, but the movement in Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an expert of new species.
There is no doubt that there are many forms of sport on the ground, which the chemical lakes would not have tried at least once.
It has enthusiastically inspired to do so.
There is always something new, and Lahtela says.
At the end of the day, one of the pregnancy was to stop completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was a mockery accident.
As a result, his Catalan people and both hands were murdered.
I was not working anywhere.
At home, I dreamt of the wounds of the year, Lahtela.
There was a bad fortune on the label.
He also admits that the age could have played a part in security.
A blind driving sounds like a laughter.
But I did not apply for borders.
It is only as species that it is not worth making too much effort!
After the accident, Lahtela was faced with a special situation.
His urgent life stopped like his wall.
Behind it was a long throw-out Japan's Everything Bay as the chief chief chief.
As soon as the end of his own career was completed, Lahtela began in 2006.
For the first time since I was fifteen years old, I had to be there.
In fact, I did not do much, Mr Lamfalsy says it.
At the time of training, Lahtela often challenged his protection in a fixed and physical testing.
Surprisingly, stagnation was a good experience.
I was so tired in physical and mental terms that my own ideas did not seem reasonable either.
Not even species.
It was good to be there.
I actually enjoyed it because for once I really did only have the opportunity to be.
The mandatory break was inspired by the Finnish chief chief chief.
Without stopping, he is afraid that he would have returned.
It is easier to find places that have gone out of the boy than conditioners!
Without an accident, I would not have realised that I needed so much rest.
About a year ago, Mr Lahtela began as a photographs in Finland.
At the same time, he found a safer pregnancy for pedestrians.
I changed movements!
It left a wonderful child straight away.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing away.
Although Mr Lammith has always been a superpower, he does not demand that his teachers be the same as him.
I am not forcing everyone to do the same.
There is a place in our species culture to be self-fathers and ways of becoming the best of the world.
The pattern is free of charge and the mentality of expenditure has always been in line with it, Mr Lammith says it.
Seattle boycotts come and we must be worried.
It is here: A report on technological developments in the sex-rolling sector - just when it had started to feel that 2017 can no longer become a bizarre year.
Yes.
The hunger boycotts have now been squeezed.
The FRR recently published a report on the development of sex race materials over the next five to ten years.
'We must begin to take the widespread sex-bottlenecks seriously ', say the founder of the Foundation and the University of Noel Sharon Sheffieland.
Clients can choose the form of racial eyes, pseudo form and oppression.
'Noroboys are being abducted, but they are already sold, and we will see more of them ', as Mr Sharon said at the publication conference.
Mine vibrations have developed from rudimentary raboycotts, which have a warm silicone, as well as theoretical features, which remind us of the use of human beings.
The user can also adapt his own minds to the form and colours of the glass of nicotine and oppression.
What is all the more worrying is that the Reverend has' personality ', which makes women in Stepford look like progressive freedom fighters.
Mine vibration has developed into racial boycotts with silicone skin.
The characteristics of Realtixrobin, for example, can be adapted to the user 's preferences, for example, for example.
The Trb Company's Roxxy Gorroboboycott has an apology: Frigid Farrah appears to be on the brink, Wild Wendy is adventuous and so on.
'Rxxxxy Golden's personality is as fully adapted as possible to the user ', the company' s website is advertised.
In other words, Reverend considers the same things as the user.
It also has different motives:
It may well be tired, drinking in the wind or 'with wind'.
There are many worrying features in the widespread use of firobres, which replace genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the subordination of women and direct rape holidays, for example, when the user approaches the race and resistance programme.
On its website, True Compano will tax Roxybott on the vibrator:
'Women have a vibrator 'and why should men not have sex robott?'
However, it is not just a fettedness or a new form of sex.
Their expansion and development reveals something black and deeper in our culture: A recession towards gender equality, where subordination is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men did not receive sex race and still have margins, even though the FRF report reveals their growing preference.
Marginal phenomena, however, reveal a great deal of time.
And many will only behave bizarre or offensive when the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sex boycotts have begun to grow while women's rights are under threat throughout the world and in Belarus there is a President who has swimmed women.
In the Television, The Handmaid 's Transit' is not the most worrying language of its strong description, for example the images of organs and of mining eyes, and what is more, how realistic the world of a sarch is.
The Republic of GALILEADER is far from our reality, but it seems to be surprisingly short-distance.
Attempts are being made to make the number of real women (by means of pornography proportions) as technically possible.
The developing world wants them to feel genuine and to trace human movements as well as possible.
However, their 'personality' is far from reality.
It is not possible to leave the relationship or the situation.
They have neither their own will nor history - there is no sign of independence or a fanaticism of total resignation.
They are welcome servants.
Sacrifice.
The police have doubts: Two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, a group led the headquarters of Iceland.
The extremist organisation Ivorian heads led a group of Australian men who are suspected of taking a planned bomb into the aeroplane.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the Ivi leader had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspicion was that the bomb was to be exported to the aeroplane on 15 July, but the company suspended before the safety inspection.
The police do not specify more precisely why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic stock-leaving machine and put it into public place, such as public transport.
The Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner, Michael Phelan, said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever in Australia.
Four men were caught in police raid on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One man has been released, but his hearings will also continue.
On the good side of Trumpin?
Mitt Romney appears to be the root of common sense.
In the Trumpin era, it has already been repeated since the shock that the strong division between voters has also been broken up by families at everyday level.
On Christmas and praise days, the American newspapers teached how to deal with the relatives who voted on Trumpi.
We all want to talk in terms of our information.
Less attention has been paid to the Trum ability to unite families.
I say this because my group was in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been watching our relationship with the Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy could have a strong combination effect.
Now that Trump is in the Belarus House, the Serb group is all supporting - including the guerrilla warfare with which he has been arguing for decades about politics - is suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
This is a good thing on the day-to-day table, but, more broadly speaking, it entails significant risks.
Mr Trump has given the left a new post, but the distorting effect of his presidential term could in fact take us all on the right track.
When we talk about Trumper and 'normalisation', we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be shocked by his tricks.
In the long term, there is even more absurd the possibility that Trump normalises the right extremist rhetoric, which suddenly seems to be very sensible compared to Trum.
I recall the absurd version of the madness of Mitt Romney: A dog in car disappearances, a 14% tax on income (and we have seen his tax notification), which, compared to more, seem to be very slight infringements.
Once the Trumpin period is over, the next presidential candidate for the republicans will only have to be clear, and that seems to be a remarkable improvement.
When my group was visiting me, we withdrew our children from the Central Centre, which is the biggest cartel and the best that New York receives on three dollars without the dogs.
The most caricature horses are huge, in the middle of the hospitals - ironic clouds and horrors - are evil, and the underlying race of music is strange.
Many of the characteristics of New York will be disappointed in time: The prospects of high-quality buildings are starting to be tired, the city's bridge will be too familiar and the reality of the city does not match the dreams.
After 35 years, I have still not been able to go completely beyond the fact that Mr Swiss Costa is not a Swiss mouse, but a large road map in Northern London.
On the other hand, there is still a bizarre lifetime in the central highlands - to the extent that two years of age, one and two quarters of women enjoy tremendous benefits.
I would have given a complete picture if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately nobody came to ask.
On the other hand, this week, I was asked in the Chamber of goods to assess my 'payment experience' from one point of view, before I installed my credit card in the chapter.
The same is true of my coffee trip, but there is also the opportunity for me to combine an evaluation of 15% service when I myself go to the coffee butcher.
This will slow down the interaction of the Arctic and put pressure on the customer to put his soil in a situation in which it is not needed.
The seller of the sales card smiled with regret when I gave my credit card to five segments of experience.
Shefs Kuquis was blocked by the Internet - 'there was no confidence in management'.
Today, FC Inter has released the post-Shefs Kuquakis delegation from the tasks of the liaison officer.
Certificate responsibility for Fabrizio Picily, who previously served as a donor.
The rest of the training group will continue to do its current job.
An Italian Picipelta has previously been a donor in, for example, England.
In January, the 51st year-old Internet training team, Picily, has carried out the UEFA Pro licence last year.
The President of the FC Interpol Government, Stefan Hoff, regrets what has happened.
It is never an easy or pleasant task to change the status quo.
However, Shefs Kuquis no longer had confidence in the leadership of the club, so that there was no alternative now, Mrs Hoff commented on the eyes of the club.
The Picily Agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He, together with other training teams, is responsible for tomorrow's return to the IGC.
According to information from Iltar, a number of teams have disappeared on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Mr Kuquis told the players that the clubs in the club, Picily and John Allen, have been sidelined.
Last Saturday, Mr Kukorn and Mr Pichel strongly welcomed the Internet match against PS Kemi.
Linda Lampesus published an image of young people from the 80s - would he identify a serious bathing student?
In Instagrammes, Linda Lampen published a youth picture.
The picture has been added to the image of a number of bulldozers, which may lead to the conclusion that the musicians are a 16th-year-old student in Sibraltar.
He himself is wondering about a young woman in a serious camera.
A long time ago, he sends out a serious message.
If the picture does not appear, you can look at it.
In the past, Lampenius has published pictures of its past and has also talked about tough issues.
Just a year ago, he published a couple of self-description in Instagrade.
He is seen in the second image 20 years ago, and in the other, he is now sending out two children.
In his presentation, Lampen is considering its growth as a human being and refers to the misery of cancer that he suffered as a young person.
I am 20 years ago and today...
I still look very much like this 26th-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to keep myself and what I see as Lampesus writing.
In English, he had added life, cancer, insecurity, self-conscience, love, 1996, 2016, older people, girls, women, ageing is a sickness.
He has spoken openly about his fears of cancer in previous years.
He was already 14 years old in hospital because of anthrax and slaves.
A little later, he also suffered from his bulb, who, in the end, was only discovered in 2006.
Improvements have begun swiftly.
In addition to the theory and comparison, Lampen helped new love.
Oversear Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital because of breast bonds.
This is the second time that Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for exports who were punished, which, according to the prison authorities, were found to have disappeared.
Mr Pistoria was sentenced to murder after the prosecutors had chosen the original killing sentence.
In early hours in 2013, he killed Sthria by fighing a number of platforms through the WCC door at home in Pretoria.
Mr Pistorius claimed to think that his girl friend was a night-loving hide in WCs.
The prosecutors have told us that they are going to appeal again because they consider the judgment of the six-year sentence of Pistoria to be too narrow.
The Public Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Africa, and this appeal will possibly be dealt with as early as this year.
If this complaint is adopted, the judgment of Mr Pistorique may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in east Africa.
Two Basque citizens were arrested for illegal interruption in Greece.
Two Basque citizens who were illegally intercepted were arrested in Greece, notified the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a number of unpromised people in Sithon on 1 August morning, including two Basque people.
They were released on the same day, but the case will continue to be investigated.
According to the television channel BTV, the Foreign Minister subsequently stated that it was releasing Basque people.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the free-for-all rules and already provide substantial fines to all those who are interrupted in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The minister stated that the right could impose fines.
Neses has already fallen by between 7.7% and 1%.
The oil processor Neses has fallen by around 7.7% at around 11 p.m.
The result before taxes were calculated, but Inquiry exceeded the forecast collected by Inquiry.
Today, the trade in screening has moved to a certain extent on the street, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Little after the opening up of the stock exchanges, a large quxx 600 index had been weighed up by 0.2%.
Since the Helsinki stock exchange index OMXH had fallen by 0.3% to 950.9.48 points and OMX25 of the most exchange companies had been weighed by 0.3%.
The overall exchange of stock exchanges was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were the chief contributor this morning.
Meat, milk products and chocolate may alleviate the syndrome of irritated chocolate.
Meat and chocolate may sound like the weight of the food label.
However, the survey claims the opposite: A diet containing a large number of meat protein and milk products could facilitate the syndrome of irrigation.
The syndrome of irrigation is an incurable illness, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain, causing casualties, peat, repeated or blood game, weight loss and extreme sympathy.
Those who suffer from the syndrome of irritation are usually invited to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers at the Washington University discovered that the necessary organ of vibration in protein would help the institution to develop immune cells which strengthen the tolerance of tolerance.
According to the Director-General for Research, Marco Colonna, immune watched the merchandise and ensures that the harmful microbials are not hidden into the body.
Cells which are a source of infection are balanced, which strengthen the ability to act, without harming vulnerable tissues.
If the balance is calculated too close to the future, it may lead to an accusation of the symptoms.
The experiments have shown that immune cells that enhance the level of tolerance are in a slump with a certain bacteria.
This bacteria needs trasche fax so that immune cells begin to emerge, and my father is one of the manufacturers of protein.
'We discovered the link between the development of Lactovillus' and embryonic cells, which are part of the normal micro-biomass of the mercury, Professor Colersundi.
"The more carcinogenic there were in the catering light of camps, the more such immune cells had."
If the same goes for people, then the combination of the Lactovillus' rhythm 'and the diet containing a large number of tritife proteins can strengthen the tolerance of the chocolate and reduce future sensitivity.
When he examined the issue of genetic modification cells, which enhance the abilities of researchers, Luisa Cervandian Barraga, found that, although one group of camps had such cells, they did not exist in the coal of the same sludge, which was kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to microbiomomics in the microbiometer of the camps, that is to say, the normal food filter community.
When DNA was examined, six bacteria varieties were detected, but not in other camps.
When, in the steel, Lactovillus was given to coal plants which did not have micro-biomass of the Finnish and which did not have genetic cells, they started to identify immune cells.
The scientists wanted to see what impact the bacteria have on the immune system, who increased Lactollillus in liquid and transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to the impotent imposing of immune cells.
Immigratory cells developed into pigs that were strengthened.
When an active ingredient was cleaned up from liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the transplant, known as indicators-3milk acid.
When researchers doubled the volume of trude fax in feedingstuffs, the number of cells that reinforce the level of tolerance increased by about 50%, and when the number of cells was halved, the number of cells fell to half of the previous ones.
According to Mr Cervance and Mr Barragani, human cells with the same absorption capacity-building capacity as in the middle, and most of us have Lactovillus in our food layer.
It is not yet known whether the Lacorillus rhetoric of 'rumini-bacteria' will be allowed to develop in the same way as in camps, but there have been gene errors in connection with the gene errors in the case of asbestography.
'We certainly want to promote the development of such cells, as they regulate the future on the fares of chocolate ', the words of Cervance-Barraga.
The 'high level of transit fax' combined with 'Lactography' may contribute to their generalisation '.
Mr Mourinho said that Mr Manchester had his grip on 'energy' after concluding an agreement with Nemania Maat.
Mr Mourinho believes that, after the agreement with Nemania Matica, Mr Manchester went to his head on 'energy', and that the central player went to Manchester United's shoulder against Sampdria on Wednesday evening.
In Dublin, in the run-up to the last half of the Union, before the UEFA curtain Centre against Real Madrid on Tuesday, he made the impression of defending a medium-sized player, Paul Pogbbba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Messrs was not yet in the best order, because he was not involved in the Asia Round before the beginning of the period, and he only rushed on the ground for 45 minutes - and Mr Mourinho said that this must change before the start of the monopoly.
'he needs time, but his experience, intelligence and philosophy make him the nerve - he has a natural sense of football ', Mr Mourourourourourourourourourourourourho says.
'We will help him to be prepared sooner rather than later '.
Not only Mr Maat, but also the newcomers, Vickseland and Romelu Lukashenko, were starting the game at the Aviv stadium, when Mourinho began to take up his inspiration for the beginning of the period.
This week, India revealed that Mr Mourinho wants another three new players, even though he has already done 'excellent work' by obtaining three of the four players he has given priority.
'three out of the four - and I should like to thank him for this - he added. '
'I am pleased to receive all four, but they did an excellent job '.
For two separate periods, the Lenyallon frustrated Germany.
The Finnish female aeroplane lost the fourth Munich blueprint to Germany directly (2325, 2325, 1425, 14 to 25).
Germany's routine level of play is high.
Their fears were equal throughout the sector, as the Finnish chief Executive, Tapio Kangaspeni, said in the press.
In the first two, Finland kept its opponents on the fence, but in one third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads to fragmentation.
When we were saved patiently and in certain places with enough aggression, we were able to wind up with the Kangassiev peninsula.
The most effective Finnish country had collected 14 points in Piia Korhonen.
On Sunday, Finland still disappeared from four matches to Slovenia.
Refugee: The large whitefish populations have already sent out the challenges in connection with the Trump Journal meeting in Russia.
In the United States, the Donald Trump Journal and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnisnitrate, have sent out challenges.
The great occupying force convened by the European Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting of the Russian lawyer known as the Donald Trump Journal and Natalia Veselnisnitsky.
It is reported by the newspaper office, Mrs Reumur, who, at the same time, confirms the convening of a large number of voters revealed earlier on Thursday by Wales Street Journal.
According to Reuter, the great occupying force has sent out the challenges in connection with the meeting of the Trump Journal and the Vesuelnitsky, which was held in June 2016 during the American presidential elections.
There were also Donald Trump Sriki, the then head of the campaign at Donald Trump, and the current adviser of the Belarus, Mr Kushner.
According to the sources of Reuter, the fact that the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, has invited a large number of vocational personnel in Washington means a stepping up of the pace of the Russian investigation.
The sources will add that Mr Mueller wanted a investigation into Russia 's involvement in the American presidential elections and whether or not he is cooperating with Russia on this issue.
The rights of Mueller will be extended by a large whitewash crew to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to show literally.
A large whitewash is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The great selection crew will weigh up the evidence surrounding the investigation of the prosecution and decide whether there should be prosecutions.

The exhibition in the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of dollars.
The last decision in the White House to fly the helicopter of the marine forces into the southern hemisphere of Belarus into this event of American production has cost the taxpayer USD 24 000, which is reflected in the documents received by the TIME army.
The name 'Marine One' of the White Sikorsky VHD-3D helicopter is used as a joke in the Valentine House on 17 and 2017, which presented American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of officials in the Belarus were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter in Connecticist, there were sailors of Mainta, a fire car Wisconsin and a carrot of Missir.
The Military Office of the White House had asked the helicopter, with a specific mandate, only about 36 hours before its landing in the Southern nursery, as shown in the documents of the shipping forces HMXV-1helicopter.
'I just wanted to ensure that you are aware of this, because it is an exceptional event which has much visibility ', the commander of HMX1, wrote in e-mail to his predecessor, who is the Deputy Commander for the purchase of marine power.
It was reported that the helicopter would arrive in the south at this morning 's seventh hour on 17 and seven hours, and that the incident would begin by three afternoon, and that Mr Helsinoper would not leave until the evening when he was scrapped between six and nine.
It was also mentioned that if a helicopter were delayed from Belarus, another crew would be required on account of time limits.
The original crew was in helicopter for the time being, and the security staff were the victim of a helicopter when it was there.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIMEE whether there was eventually a need for another crew.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state assets for political ends.
According to the documents, HMX 1 asked whether this is a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether Hatch Act was infringed here and we were told that it was not violated", that the commander wrote.
'It sounds as if you can participate ', the assistants replied.
It was an official event in the Belarus, so it was not covered by Hatch Act.
However, official events also have political tone.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of health reform, which was dealt with at the time by the Senate, and in favour of less state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One aircraft for political ends is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys;
But their use for photographs is unusual.
In February, when Air Force One rushed on the background of the presidential campaign in Melbourne in the Florida Länder, Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor in Twitt.
'The white house is very pleased with the occurrence of the 'hot air', which presented products from American workers from all 50 Länder ', said in the White House that Lindordy Wallah.
The staff of HMXA 1 regularly carry out training flights in the Washington region and, in the south, use the south of the south to bring the President to the Belarus housing with the exact precision of the instalments.
When the Trump was in Germany at the G20 Summit at the beginning of July, HMX 1 made 58 training bill into the white house.
According to one official, flights were part of the monthly training quota for crews.
On that day, the helicopters of the unit also flying 11 hours in 'twin-presidential support'.
According to the White House, there was no other cost to the taxpayer.
The Sikorsky Info-Point told us that the company was not involved in organising the helicopter's presentation on the southern nucleus of Belarus.
HMXA 1 has no accounting for flights relating to the role of President, and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event carefully.
According to the compensation of the Defence Ministry for 2017, the level of compensation for the VHD 380 is USD 24 380 per hour.
According to the documents of HMX1, flights from the state of Virginia to the white winter and back a hour.
According to the White House, the cost of helicopter is clearly lower.
'There is a misleading reduction in the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation '.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, rehabilitation and many other so-called scrapped costs, which are taken into account in the annual budget. "
According to a study by the RAND research company in 2015, compensation levels do not contain staff costs, but they take account of the costs of fuel, rehabilitation and contract.
At the time of the event, the former secretary of the Belarus, Mr Sean Speer, argued against the use of helicopter in the event.
'The idea is to present American production ', as Mr Söderer said.
'I know that Mr Sikorsky and Mr Connecticutin's Länder are very proud of being involved in securing national security and therefore employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I believe that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopter and other defence equipment, for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is entirely appropriate to say '.
It is not certain whether he will be in Trump helicopter during the event, but at least he reported to the car driver.
In the White House, Trump scourged the press on its own Sicorsky fleet.
'I know Mr Sikorsky very well ', the President said:' I have three '.

The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local hardship is particularly affected by the form of tourism represented by aircraft.
The Italian Culture Minister calls it a 'eat and evacuation' tourist: There are only a few hours at stake and grass-roots grass-roots grass-roots vigilance.
Venice is a swift cry for tourists in the city.
It is difficult to move around the narrow streets and fine gaps are so full of visitors that the people of Venice no longer have access to the troops.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre, while homes have become hotels.
The problems posed by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Tigo and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a bad-quality tourist - alert Toulouse.
When a large carrier arrives, two or three hours will be given time.
The lessons to be learned by the Seurine flag from Piazzo from Rialto the brink of Rialto and the St Markus, and returned, describe the tourism which prevails and causes problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of urban identity.
The St Markus also belongs to the most popular visits of the historical centre of Venice.
The Church of Pope Markus is on the edge of the rhetoric.
Local indignation is also mainly aimed at carriers.
50 000 local people live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were approximately 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Russians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and drives the inhabitants out.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this goes on, there will be no tourists in Venice in a few years' time.
It would be a social, anthrax and historic catastrophe, saying Carlo Belvarem, who was organising the demonstration.
It is a difficult equation, because ships are importing Venice to look for the incomes they desperately need and create the need for a large number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is envisaged to allow the perpetrators to go further from the historic centre.
According to Luciano Borst, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if Venice's administrative area, where Venice is searching, were to be given more power - if not full autonomy - to decide on its own affairs.
Every year, between 200m and 30 million tourists are visiting Venice.

On Thursday afternoon, the night went on to the Siilind side of the Ilmessy statute, that is to say to the golden gold.
I will do well without such attention.
The 23th-year-old junta has seen the grievances of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published splendid pictures of its own, for example in the Grand Cloron landscape.
In his current country of Norway, Amalie Iuel, the Danish Norway, has become a popular sportsperson, not least because in March he broken 26 years of infringement of the record of 400 metres of old Norway by circumventing the race of 51.81.
A month later, he improved the sub-skills of 400 metres at the time of Norway's record at 55.38.
The Iuel of the social media, which is a great deal of time after its record, will soon find that there are reservations in terms of belonging and publicity.
Men all over the world apparently started sending pictures of their gender body in the hope that they will be interested by a young junta.
The Iuel was forced to close off the Snapace accounts from outside.
I received a lot of 'crumbs' from unknown people, so I had to turn my accounts into private, Iuel told the VGL.
Iuel did not want to identify exactly what images he received in an interview with the VG.
You can imagine, Iuel navigation.
It is scandalous to get a feedback after the window of opportunity, but I will do well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Dane, a father of Danish.
The Iuel family changed to Norway when Amales were 2.
When Amales were 12 years old, the family changed first to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
Then there was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university journalist in Los Angeles, who returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship to Norway.
In Norway, Iuel is travelling with the lessons of three pieces of literature, Leüsv Olav Alnest, Karin Warholm and Elisabeth Sörensen.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, voters are not asking anything, but simply making provisions.
In Norway, the literature has much more time to deal personally with the sportsman, Mr Iuel said to the VG.
Amalie Iuel is holding Norway's record in 400 metres and 400 metres in aquaculture.
The fertiliser, Jnne Korge, went to the whole career - now in the Mexico: "Nice when nothing is gained".
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
In this period, Jnne Kormer, one of the most successful Islamic performers in Finland, 31, has once again been able to enjoy his love of species.
As long ago as last summer, the resumption of the career was at stake.
The harder pregnancy on the table had forced the Korm cabinet on the table in January, and the generous desire was not to improve anything.
It too had taken part in the architecture.
In the summer, I did not know at all what I am doing, whether or not the launch will continue.
The sponsors were disappearing and there are many things open, Mr Kormer says.
It is said, however, that things are usually organised.
The peanuts, sponsors continued the agreement for two years, and the blood started again.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it by the latest when I went to read it.
I was that a few more people would be withdrawn, but this is so nice.
Mr Korakas has not been able to count properly until September or October, but, after a long period of calculation, it has been a big blow to treat.
Only a few have been evacuated by the Korus.
It is not harmful.
Competition has never been the most important architecture of the launch.
I have never fallen because of one cat.
Malta believes it is frustrating to focus four years on clusters, and then you will be listening to that week.
I do not think so, Mr Korakas says.
Today, Mr Korakas is trailing in the cheap of the Ms in Spain in Sierra Neku.
Although the individual cats do not like him on a plate, he always gets bogged down in a tough surveillance of bullying.
According to Korhola, the value of the plants organised by the International Coal Union has increased over the past few years, even though some launchers have chosen to hold Norway Xu-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important cats, visibility is a big one.
For the rest, however, the value always depends on the conditions and levels of the games.
He is the oldest sportsperson of the twelve in Sierra Neku in Finland.
The teams, the Rene Rinnexenophobia and Emma Parkennium, are 14 years younger.
It is harsh to monitor the spending of younger blood.
I remember when I myself was at a time when everything was new and so ill-enthusiastic.
It will give itself a new post, Mr Korakas will consider.
I am still in the Red Cross, but otherwise I will not - there is a flow!
A different sporting career has also been built on the basis of the Lautals career.
The boy of Pekka Kormann, who is a hotcher, has school in raw sport: A woman has his own raw beds to whom he is making mainstreaming programmes.
As I am always on the brink, there can be no more room for manoeuvre.
But every day I see at least food incomes and, in general, something from the starting point, Mr Kormer says.
According to Mr Korhola, the maternity and charging plan is a potential slaughter plan when the launch career comes to an end in due course.
I am not planning that far, but it is at least a likely option.
I see it as little as I would like to study it alongside this logic.
I will try to keep up with time and develop, perhaps in the summer, to drive some of the starting points.
If it is a further profession, then it will not be difficult to start when it is already in place in the species.
Adulterated people also include pilots with Jaajo Linnondon.
At the end of May, Catalonia has crashed a carriage ship directing towards Elitre competition in Stockholm at the end of Stockholm.
Mr Korakas and Mr Linondon decided to revive the old tradition.
Risk testing has gone very far and people have been enthusiastic.
We are already at the point where there is no bankruptcy at all.
We still have a few months, we hope that the ship will be full, Mr Korakas says in his enthusiasm.
Attendon's hotel project has all been surprised to Kurdish.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new hotel of 41A elderly people.
The building of 1 700 square metres will be prepared next summer on the other side of the Health Centre's neighbour Terveterinary.
The general issue of mixture is what the clients need to do with the new management unit, since, in the course of the wars of Siun, many private treatments are now leaving the client.
Anne Father said that in future King will have more demand, not only for alternatives, but also for improved service provision.
There is a need for all kinds of services, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice will also work better, then Mr Färm will say so.
Last year, Mr Attendo bought private treatments from Karea, both Kanervika and Eerror.
Trade in businesses was a matter of business, but buildings are apparently a five-year-old agreement.
Mr Fatuzzo says that there is no need for Attendon to move away from these farms.
A further topic will be raised later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie-Scots plant in Scotland.
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie 'invention manufacturers of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish department of the GMB, the company has not informed us of its plans for the future of the Tolls plant.
The manufacturer of Hobnobus and Reverend Tea and other products has more than 500 employees.
The McVitie 'Scandinavian company said that it had invested more than GBP 5 million in recent years.
The company added that 'employees and trade unionists' will be the first to be told if changes are to take place.
In a letter to the Director-General, GMB 'calls on the company to' respond to the concern that there is no funding to modernise production plants'.
The fact that the director of the GMBP trade union, Dow Duff, is not informed of the needs and future investment plans is very worrying.
'families have worked here for generations and the workforce has concentrated heavily on the local community and on the Glasgow Strip, which is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, wages, livelihoods and constant reductions in living costs and production, the eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie production. "
According to the information provided by Mr Pladish, the manufacturer had received a letter from the trade union only the day before and the company is directly responsible for the letter, because it appreciates the constant interaction between workers and trade unions.
'We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollo two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with workers, among other things, that, like other very competing and insecure companies in the market, we will keep an eye on all our business activities and our offices constantly in order to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the information provided, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in recent years in the Tolls factory, in particular its production sectors and its improvement.
'We are aware of the long history of Tolls as a production institution and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade unionists if we are to change the work. '
Were PSG Barcelona transferred three years ago?
Laiga Liga may well disappear from his interest in Marco Preparation.
The Paris Saint Germans will not dump after paying for the conclusion of the GBP 189 million agreement, but will PSG be warned of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most recent case in the summer, and the team of Lithuania 1 in France is prepared to break the world record of transfer, less than half the less: It was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester Unitedii at 89 million.
After the transfer, Nepal will become the most expensive football player in the world and also the best paid professional sportsperson in the world, as PSG will provide him with more than 500 000 copies a week after taxes.

Three years ago, did the Chairman of the PSG take the football world from this transfer?
When Manchester City declared that he was interested in Blaise Maat in 2014, Nasser Alhelaifi warned clubs for the best players in the SGO.
'I am not worried because they know that if they dream of our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players', 'All-Khelaifi'.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they dream of our players, they will have to face the consequences'.
This seems to have been the case: It expressed its interest in Marco's middle player earlier this summer.
Mr PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that, as a result, it would lose its ruminant player in Nepal.
