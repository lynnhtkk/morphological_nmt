a 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old che@@ f who had recently mo@@ ved to S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co was found de@@ ad in the sta@@ ir@@ well of a local m@@ all this week .
but the victi@@ m &apos;s bro@@ ther says he can &apos;@@ t think of anyone who would want to h@@ ur@@ t him , saying , &quot; Th@@ ings were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the W@@ es@@ t@@ field M@@ all W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day morning was identi@@ fied as 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co resid@@ ent Fran@@ k Galic@@ ia , the S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co Med@@ ical Ex@@ a@@ min@@ er &apos;s Office said .
the S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co Pol@@ ice D@@ e@@ part@@ ment said the death was r@@ ul@@ ed a hom@@ ic@@ ide and an investig@@ ation is on@@ going .
the victi@@ m &apos;s bro@@ ther , L@@ ou@@ is Galic@@ ia , told A@@ B@@ C sta@@ tion K@@ G@@ O in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co that Fran@@ k , pre@@ viously a line co@@ ok in Bos@@ ton , had lan@@ ded his dre@@ am job as line che@@ f at S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co &apos;s s@@ ons &a@@ mp@@ ; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant six months ago .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for s@@ ons &a@@ mp@@ ; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters said they were &quot; sho@@ c@@ ked and dev@@ asta@@ ted &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small te@@ am that oper@@ ates like a close k@@ ni@@ t family and he will be de@@ arly mis@@ sed , &quot; the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
our thou@@ ghts and cond@@ ol@@ ences are with Fran@@ k &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
L@@ ou@@ is Galic@@ ia said Fran@@ k initi@@ ally sta@@ yed in h@@ os@@ tel@@ s , but recently , &quot; Th@@ ings were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an a@@ part@@ ment , he was d@@ ating a g@@ ir@@ l , &quot; L@@ ou@@ is Galic@@ ia told K@@ G@@ O .
L@@ ou@@ is Galic@@ ia said he could not think of anyone who would want to h@@ ur@@ t his youn@@ ger bro@@ ther .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connec@@ ting with the family was always making us a dis@@ h , making us d@@ inn@@ er , &quot; L@@ ou@@ is Galic@@ ia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of alter@@ c@@ ation .
he was the bro@@ ther that w@@ ent with the flo@@ w .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that di@@ amon@@ d in the rou@@ gh that was sh@@ in@@ ing b@@ right every day , &quot; he said .

j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors strik@@ e : calls for f@@ res@@ h industrial action
representatives of j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors have called on their union to author@@ ise f@@ res@@ h industrial action in their dispu@@ te about a new contrac@@ t .
the J@@ uni@@ or D@@ oc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ D@@ C ) of the British Med@@ ical As@@ soci@@ ation ( B@@ M@@ A ) is to ask its full coun@@ cil to back more industrial action from early September .
the J@@ D@@ C says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contrac@@ t .
j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors and med@@ ical stud@@ ents voted in July to reject a contrac@@ t deal agreed with the B@@ M@@ A .
it was rejected by 5@@ 8 % of its members who voted in the b@@ all@@ ot .
in a letter to members rele@@ ased on T@@ wit@@ ter on Th@@ urs@@ day night , the J@@ D@@ C &apos;s cha@@ ir E@@ ll@@ en Mc@@ Court said the government had remain@@ ed &quot; per@@ sis@@ ten@@ tly sil@@ ent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resul@@ ted in the contrac@@ t being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the J@@ D@@ C Ex@@ ecu@@ tive has voted to reject the proposed new contrac@@ t in full and to call for formal re@@ -@@ negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s sil@@ ence , J@@ D@@ C ex@@ e@@ c has today made a formal request for a special meeting of B@@ M@@ A Council to author@@ ise a ro@@ ll@@ ing programme of es@@ cal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispu@@ te has led to j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors taking part in six strik@@ es this year , including the first all@@ -@@ out sto@@ p@@ pa@@ ges in the history of the N@@ H@@ S .
the B@@ M@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tor lead@@ er , D@@ r J@@ o@@ han@@ n M@@ ala@@ w@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned following the vote to reject the negoti@@ ated terms of the contrac@@ t , which the B@@ M@@ A had recommend@@ ed .
he had told B@@ M@@ A members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the pol@@ l of 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors and med@@ ical stud@@ ents .
following the vote , Health Secre@@ tary J@@ er@@ em@@ y H@@ un@@ t said the contrac@@ t would be imposed on medic@@ s in Eng@@ land .
Russia and Turkey : an &apos; alli@@ ance of mis@@ f@@ its &apos; ?
it was a g@@ es@@ ture that en@@ ded a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tu@@ es@@ day to sha@@ ke hands and dec@@ l@@ are a formal end to an ei@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir P@@ u@@ tin gre@@ e@@ ted his Turkish coun@@ ter@@ part in the g@@ il@@ ded h@@ all of a S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg pal@@ ace , I got the distinc@@ t impression that An@@ kar@@ a wants this re@@ conciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ sha@@ ke , yes .
but Mr P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s s@@ mil@@ e lo@@ ok@@ ed th@@ in and he was har@@ dly o@@ o@@ z@@ ing warm@@ th even by his own res@@ train@@ ed standards .
R@@ ec@@ ep T@@ a@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an by contr@@ ast tal@@ ked repe@@ a@@ tedly of his &quot; de@@ ar fri@@ end &quot; Mr P@@ u@@ tin - five times , according to one report .
I lost coun@@ t .
he also ple@@ d@@ ged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre@@ -@@ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one new@@ s@@ paper here described Mr E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an as ac@@ ting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m imp@@ li@@ ed the opposite .
but a l@@ ing@@ ering co@@ ol@@ ness em@@ an@@ ating from Mr P@@ u@@ tin show@@ ed that Russia &apos;s lead@@ er has for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey &apos;s sho@@ ot@@ ing down of a Russian fi@@ gh@@ ter plan@@ e on the S@@ y@@ rian border .
Mos@@ co@@ w &apos;s re@@ action at the time was fu@@ ri@@ ous .
Mr P@@ u@@ tin las@@ hed out , acc@@ using An@@ kar@@ a of sta@@ b@@ b@@ ing Mos@@ co@@ w in the back .
the off@@ ence was even greater , coming from a sup@@ posed fri@@ end .
re@@ building real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , sta@@ te@@ -@@ controll@@ ed media conduc@@ ted a sta@@ gg@@ ering , all@@ -@@ out off@@ ensi@@ ve against An@@ kar@@ a .
all of a su@@ d@@ den , it seem@@ ed like Tur@@ ks were to bla@@ me for everything .
most serious were acc@@ us@@ ations from top officials that Mr E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an &apos;s own family has pro@@ fi@@ ted from an illegal trade in oil from areas of S@@ y@@ ria controll@@ ed by the so@@ -@@ called Isla@@ mic State .
he &apos;s d@@ eni@@ ed that empha@@ tically .
but in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because Mr P@@ u@@ tin got the a@@ pol@@ og@@ y he deman@@ ded from President E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an .
Russia could claim a vic@@ tory of sor@@ ts .
for An@@ kar@@ a the benefits of calling a tru@@ ce are clear .
first and fore@@ most , E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an needs all the friends he can get after he was ne@@ arly ous@@ ted from power last month in a failed cou@@ p .
repeat terro@@ r attacks on Turkey have clearly sha@@ ken him too .
there is also an economic mo@@ tive .
Russian sanctions have h@@ it hard - particularly the ban on char@@ ter f@@ li@@ ghts , which us@@ u@@ ally carry several million Russian tou@@ ris@@ ts to the Turkish co@@ ast each year .
the number has s@@ lu@@ mp@@ ed by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , t@@ our operators and char@@ ter companies here will certainly be reli@@ ev@@ ed when f@@ li@@ ghts even@@ tually res@@ u@@ me .
they &apos;@@ re ban@@ king on a la@@ te@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on r@@ us@@ h to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state T@@ V has been pre@@ dic@@ ting che@@ aper fru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les once Turkish agricultural impor@@ ts are per@@ mitted again .
&quot; tou@@ ris@@ ts that way , tom@@ a@@ to@@ es back here , &quot; as a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ os@@ ti new@@ s@@ paper ph@@ ras@@ ed it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Mos@@ co@@ w .
An@@ kar@@ a is ang@@ ry with the W@@ est for what it considers a wea@@ k response to the attemp@@ ted take@@ over .
add to that its l@@ ong@@ -@@ standing gr@@ ud@@ ge at the s@@ na@@ il &apos;s p@@ ace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr P@@ u@@ tin - who is keen to cap@@ ita@@ lis@@ e on the ch@@ ill and ch@@ i@@ p away at Turkey &apos;s ties with the W@@ est .
the Russian lead@@ er certainly w@@ on b@@ on@@ us points with An@@ kar@@ a for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attemp@@ ted cou@@ p .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for Mos@@ co@@ w which has its own deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this g@@ l@@ it@@ z@@ y , se@@ asi@@ de pal@@ ace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analys@@ t described to me as an &quot; alli@@ ance of mis@@ f@@ its &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mis@@ treated by the W@@ est , join@@ ing forces .
still , despite the public dis@@ play of re@@ conciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is S@@ y@@ ria , where Mos@@ co@@ w has recently been cas@@ ting itself as pe@@ ac@@ em@@ ak@@ er but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
it could be tell@@ ing that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presid@@ ents told a press conference that they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even tou@@ ched on the to@@ pi@@ c .
Turkey &apos;s presid@@ ent deliber@@ ately avoid@@ ed answ@@ ering a question on their differences , while Mr P@@ u@@ tin ch@@ ose to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on S@@ y@@ ria .
but after months of open h@@ os@@ til@@ ity - and given the potential for ut@@ ter disaster when Na@@ to member Turkey sho@@ t down that Russian fi@@ gh@@ ter j@@ et - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scot@@ land to dis@@ appear for custom@@ ers outside Scot@@ land
the br@@ and R@@ B@@ S is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the ban@@ k &apos;s ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scot@@ land will dis@@ appear for custom@@ ers outside Scot@@ land .
R@@ os@@ s Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an told B@@ B@@ C Scot@@ land that the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and was associated with the ban@@ k &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
it has re@@ treated from them since it ne@@ arly coll@@ ap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be ba@@ iled out .
during that time , br@@ and strateg@@ ists have used &apos; R@@ B@@ S &apos; to protect other consumer finance b@@ ran@@ ds .
it was bac@@ ked with millions of p@@ oun@@ ds in s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship of international sport , from S@@ i@@ x Nations ru@@ g@@ by to W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ on cha@@ mp@@ ion An@@ d@@ y M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y .
but now , it has been jud@@ ged right to let more national b@@ ran@@ ds come to the fore .
Ro@@ y@@ al Bank of Scot@@ land will be used with Scot@@ t@@ ish custom@@ ers , but will not be initi@@ alised .
in Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es , all R@@ B@@ S refer@@ ences , outside head office and the sto@@ ck exchange lis@@ ting , will be changed to N@@ at@@ W@@ est .
the U@@ l@@ s@@ ter Bank br@@ and is already used for custom@@ ers in the Republic of Ireland and Nor@@ thern Ireland .
there are other , small@@ er b@@ ran@@ ds for private ban@@ king , which will get more pro@@ min@@ ence - C@@ out@@ ts , A@@ d@@ am &a@@ mp@@ ; C@@ o , D@@ r@@ um@@ mon@@ d , and H@@ ol@@ t &apos;s M@@ ili@@ tary Bank .
Mr Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an was inter@@ vie@@ wed during a t@@ our of custom@@ ers and staff in In@@ ver@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ sh@@ ire .
he told B@@ B@@ C Scot@@ land : &quot; the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and will end up becoming our inves@@ tor br@@ and and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a ban@@ k of b@@ ran@@ ds . &quot;
as the ban@@ k itself bec@@ a@@ me a global br@@ and , R@@ B@@ S bec@@ a@@ me the global br@@ and .
I &apos;@@ m now saying we no longer have global as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , we have local as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
each one of those b@@ ran@@ ds will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with custom@@ ers under those b@@ ran@@ ds .
R@@ B@@ S had already stated that it would not to continue its S@@ i@@ x Nations s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship , and it has been ra@@ ising the prof@@ ile of different b@@ ran@@ ds in its s@@ ports s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the ban@@ k of b@@ ran@@ ds , because under@@ ne@@ ath ( we &apos;@@ ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better ban@@ k for custom@@ ers ? &quot; said the ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive .
it would have been very c@@ yn@@ ical three years ago if we &apos;@@ d said we &apos;@@ re going to be a great ban@@ k for custom@@ ers and put those b@@ ran@@ ds out there .
but with the work we &apos;@@ ve been doing , foc@@ us@@ sing on the custom@@ ers needs , not our own , I think you &apos;@@ re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those b@@ ran@@ ds back up again , so I think the time is right .

Fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best jo@@ c@@ ke@@ ys of the modern er@@ a and it is no surpris@@ e he has reached this lan@@ d@@ mark so few have achieved before him .
he is sty@@ lis@@ h and strong , but it is his tac@@ tical n@@ ous that s@@ ets him apart from others in the w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ing room .
he is a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or for rac@@ ing , his en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma have been drawing f@@ ans to the sport for years .

seriously though , Fran@@ ki@@ e &apos;s been rid@@ ing w@@ inn@@ ers in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .

Russia &apos;s P@@ u@@ tin sa@@ cks ch@@ i@@ ef of staff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ o@@ v
Russian President V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir P@@ u@@ tin has une@@ x@@ pec@@ tedly dis@@ mis@@ sed his ch@@ i@@ ef of staff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ o@@ v .
Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v has been part of Mr P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s tr@@ us@@ ted inn@@ er circ@@ le for many years .
the 6@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in said that Mr P@@ u@@ tin had &quot; dec@@ re@@ ed to reli@@ eve I@@ van@@ o@@ v of his du@@ ties as head of the Russian presid@@ ential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ty since 20@@ 12 , An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o , has been ap@@ pointed as his success@@ or .
Mr V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
bor@@ n in the Es@@ ton@@ ian capital T@@ all@@ in@@ n in 197@@ 2 , he gradu@@ ated from the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Mos@@ co@@ w State In@@ stitu@@ te of International R@@ el@@ ations ( M@@ G@@ I@@ M@@ O ) and ser@@ ved in the T@@ o@@ ky@@ o emb@@ ass@@ y .
later he managed presid@@ ential pro@@ tocol and government staff , the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in we@@ b@@ sit@@ e says ( in Russian ) .
on being ap@@ pointed , he told Mr P@@ u@@ tin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of draf@@ ting laws and control over how your ins@@ truc@@ tions are implemented .
Mr P@@ u@@ tin told a Russian T@@ V sta@@ tion on F@@ rid@@ ay that Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v had asked to leave the post , and recommend@@ ed that Mr V@@ ain@@ o should re@@ place him .
do the s@@ mil@@ es con@@ vin@@ ce ?
this is a move that has m@@ ys@@ ti@@ fied Mos@@ co@@ w .
Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ o@@ v has long been one of V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s clos@@ est all@@ ies and , like him , ser@@ ved in the So@@ vi@@ et security service , the K@@ G@@ B .
as ch@@ i@@ ef of staff he was one of the most power@@ ful men in the country .
in a meeting with President P@@ u@@ tin shown on state television both men claim@@ ed that the ch@@ i@@ ef of staff was ste@@ pp@@ ing down at his own request .
but despite the s@@ mil@@ es for the ca@@ mer@@ as , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall@@ -@@ out from some kind of power str@@ u@@ gg@@ le ?
N@@ o@@ -@@ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential presid@@ ent , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly wanted to run Russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in remarks to Mr P@@ u@@ tin , quo@@ ted on the Kre@@ m@@ l@@ in we@@ b@@ sit@@ e , Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 20@@ 12 I asked you , in a conver@@ sa@@ tion , to entr@@ ust me with this very compl@@ icated post , even - you could say - tro@@ ub@@ l@@ es@@ ome post , for four years .
well , it tur@@ ns out that I &apos;@@ ve been presid@@ ential ch@@ i@@ ef of staff for four years and eight months .
Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v took up the post in December 20@@ 11 .
he ser@@ ved pre@@ viously as a de@@ pu@@ ty pr@@ ime minis@@ ter and defence minis@@ ter .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the K@@ G@@ B state security service , like Mr P@@ u@@ tin .
in the late 199@@ 0@@ s , when Mr P@@ u@@ tin was head of the F@@ eder@@ al Security Ser@@ vice ( F@@ S@@ B ) , which re@@ placed the K@@ G@@ B , Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v was ap@@ pointed as his de@@ pu@@ ty .
when Mr P@@ u@@ tin came to power , he na@@ med Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v as one of the five people he tr@@ us@@ ted most .
it was once thought that Mr I@@ van@@ o@@ v might become presid@@ ent of Russia after Mr P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s second term , as a third term for Mr P@@ u@@ tin would have been un@@ constitutional .
but that post was taken by another close P@@ u@@ tin ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ved@@ e@@ v .
Mr P@@ u@@ tin bec@@ a@@ me pr@@ ime minis@@ ter , before re@@ turning to the presidency just thre@@ e@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years later .

G@@ i@@ b@@ son was involved in a p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal alter@@ c@@ ation on the set of the show in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es last month .
A@@ B@@ C stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision stu@@ di@@ os , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al in a joint statement .
G@@ i@@ b@@ son , who played S@@ peci@@ al Ag@@ ent A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ot@@ ch@@ ner , issu@@ ed an a@@ pol@@ og@@ y on Th@@ urs@@ day before his termin@@ ation was announced .
there were cre@@ ative differences on the set and a dis@@ agreement .
I regret that it oc@@ cur@@ red , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how G@@ i@@ b@@ son &apos;s charac@@ ter will be written out of the show , which follow@@ s a te@@ am of F@@ B@@ I ag@@ ents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the A@@ B@@ C stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision stu@@ di@@ os statement .
the 5@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old , who pre@@ viously star@@ red on the sit@@ co@@ m D@@ har@@ ma &a@@ mp@@ ; Gre@@ g , had been on the show since its first se@@ as@@ on in 2005 .
&quot; I lo@@ ve C@@ r@@ imin@@ al min@@ ds and have put my heart and sou@@ l into it for the last t@@ wel@@ ve years , &quot; G@@ i@@ b@@ son said in a statement rele@@ ased on F@@ rid@@ ay .
I had hop@@ ed to see it through to the end , but that w@@ on &apos;@@ t be possible now .
I would just like to say thank you to the w@@ ri@@ ters , producers , ac@@ tors , our a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing cre@@ w , and , most importan@@ tly , the best f@@ ans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is s@@ lated to return for its t@@ wel@@ f@@ th se@@ as@@ on on 28 September .

despite the mas@@ sive siz@@ e and w@@ eight of the br@@ id@@ ge compl@@ et@@ ing the clos@@ ure between the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and br@@ id@@ ge dec@@ k is a del@@ icate operation involving extremely precise toler@@ an@@ ces for f@@ it up .
overall , ne@@ arly 7@@ 9 % of the total br@@ id@@ ge dec@@ k is now in place , the final sec@@ tion of dec@@ k is having its concrete dec@@ k c@@ ast in R@@ os@@ yt@@ h today , mean@@ ing all the dec@@ k is ready to be lif@@ ted into place on the br@@ id@@ ge .
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el Mar@@ tin , for@@ th C@@ ros@@ sing Br@@ id@@ ge construc@@ tors project direc@@ tor said : &quot; the first clos@@ ure on any br@@ id@@ ge project is always a significant mil@@ es@@ t@@ one .
on this f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic project , this clos@@ ure represents leading ed@@ ge civil eng@@ ine@@ ering .
after ins@@ tall@@ ing the last road dec@@ k sec@@ tion and connec@@ ting it to the ex@@ pan@@ ding North T@@ ow@@ er road dec@@ k , we then had to close the remain@@ ing ga@@ p on the nor@@ th - or lan@@ d@@ ward - side .
this was done by pu@@ ll@@ ing the nor@@ thern approach vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 7@@ 00 mill@@ im@@ et@@ res sou@@ th@@ wards .
this was a mas@@ sive and , at the same time , very del@@ icate operation .
mas@@ sive because the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t is 2@@ 22 met@@ res long , w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s appro@@ xim@@ ately 6@@ ,@@ 000 tonn@@ es and had to be pu@@ ll@@ ed up a gra@@ di@@ ent of about 3 % .
del@@ icate because the toler@@ an@@ ces the te@@ am were working to were tin@@ y - just a few mill@@ im@@ et@@ res either way .
happ@@ ily , it all w@@ ent very well .
Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay res@@ c@@ ue : three men are &apos; lu@@ ck@@ y to be al@@ iv@@ e@@ &apos;
three men are &quot; lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve &quot; after they were th@@ ro@@ wn from their fishing bo@@ at off Ang@@ l@@ es@@ e@@ y .
Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ L@@ I li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at sta@@ tion raised the al@@ arm at 13 : 20 B@@ S@@ T on F@@ rid@@ ay after a cre@@ w saw the inc@@ ident un@@ f@@ old in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay .
the three men str@@ u@@ gg@@ led to s@@ wi@@ m to safety while their bo@@ at continued under its own power .
&quot; we saw their bo@@ at cir@@ cl@@ ing close to them and imag@@ ined the wor@@ st , &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at hel@@ m V@@ in@@ ce J@@ ones .
&quot; for@@ tunately , by the time we had laun@@ ched , the strong w@@ in@@ ds had blo@@ wn it clear of them , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing bo@@ at , while the third man , aged 60 , was found ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted and cl@@ inging to a bu@@ o@@ y without a li@@ fe@@ j@@ ac@@ ket .
they were all taken on board the in@@ shor@@ e li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at and brought back to the li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at sta@@ tion
Mr J@@ ones said : &quot; the three men th@@ ro@@ wn in the water are lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve and completely un@@ in@@ ju@@ red .
the bo@@ at &apos;s eng@@ ine had an emergency k@@ ill cor@@ d but it had some@@ how come deta@@ ched from the person dri@@ ving the bo@@ at when it cap@@ sized .
some@@ one was w@@ at@@ ching over these gu@@ ys today .
P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o a wor@@ thy hun@@ t for health and happ@@ in@@ ess
it is fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating to see how the world tur@@ ns .
that te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and children do not get outside to play any more , prefer@@ ring to spen@@ d their free time looking at s@@ cre@@ ens , has been the la@@ ment of many for the the past dec@@ ade .
Po@@ k@@ em@@ on G@@ o is getting people off the cou@@ ch and into some activity .
s@@ cre@@ en time was initi@@ ally limited to the television then v@@ ide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and more recently s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es .
so it is great to see that technology and being active out@@ do@@ ors are not mu@@ tually exclu@@ sive .
I am of course referring to the cra@@ z@@ e that is P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o , an A@@ P@@ P based on the charac@@ ters first created for v@@ ide@@ o g@@ am@@ es in the 199@@ 0@@ s ( it later s@@ pa@@ w@@ ned a car@@ to@@ on series , playing c@@ ards and other sp@@ in off@@ s ) .
like many po@@ p cultural phen@@ om@@ ena it had gone off the bo@@ il somewhat before this new ga@@ me was made available in the US , Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia and New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in early July .
the laun@@ ch in other countries was then dela@@ yed by the mas@@ sive response , which over@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed ser@@ vers .
within days , P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o had more users than T@@ ind@@ er and ne@@ arly as many as T@@ wit@@ ter .
so how does it work ?
in a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ el@@ l , pla@@ yers on s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es go out looking for P@@ ok@@ é@@ mon@@ s , which are trac@@ ked with a G@@ P@@ S and , once found , can be &apos; p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed &apos; ( via a s@@ cre@@ ens@@ ho@@ t on your ph@@ one ) or &apos; cap@@ tu@@ red &apos; .
a generation who played the ga@@ me when youn@@ ger have join@@ ed the cra@@ z@@ e , ju@@ mp@@ ing off the cou@@ ch for the se@@ ar@@ ch .
in the US , the ga@@ me has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
Car@@ dio@@ gra@@ m , an A@@ P@@ P for the app@@ le Wat@@ ch that trac@@ ks 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 users , told the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost recently that within two days of the ga@@ me laun@@ ching , the number of people it trac@@ ked who did 30 minu@@ tes of exercise each day ju@@ mp@@ ed from 45 per cent to 5@@ 3 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o - it just se@@ es ra@@ w data on exercise levels .
many public health campa@@ ig@@ ns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the cou@@ ch &quot; and &quot; be active ever@@ yd@@ ay &quot; have fall@@ en on de@@ a@@ f e@@ ars because most public health messa@@ ges are bor@@ ing and deli@@ ver@@ ed by people who look mis@@ er@@ able .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be under@@ stated .
those who exercise reg@@ ularly reduce their chan@@ ces of getting canc@@ er or de@@ pression .
activity help@@ s with w@@ eight management , high blood pressure , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the be@@ au@@ ty of P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o is it gets people outside doing something they enjo@@ y .
thus you are cover@@ ing three pill@@ ars of health - movement , f@@ res@@ h air and su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and fu@@ n .
some people are even making new friends on the hun@@ t .
as us@@ ual there are po@@ -@@ faced kill@@ jo@@ ys looking for something to compla@@ in about .
and yes some@@ body might w@@ al@@ k into a do@@ or .
so what ?
a bre@@ ak@@ through has oc@@ cur@@ red .
for while s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one app@@ s like F@@ it@@ bit could pre@@ viously tra@@ ck our activity , they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t give us a reason to exercise like this ga@@ me does .
the no@@ vel@@ ty will we@@ ar off and use will sub@@ side in due course .
however because of P@@ ok@@ me@@ on &apos;s success there will be more g@@ am@@ es that comb@@ ine app@@ s and vir@@ tual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hun@@ t to be more active , f@@ itte@@ r and heal@@ th@@ i@@ er .

as for B@@ il@@ es , the 19@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old &apos;s vi@@ ral tw@@ eet from earlier this week now car@@ ries a whole new mean@@ ing :

two women and a 12@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l who di@@ ed in the dead@@ li@@ est attack in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x &apos;s first ser@@ ial kill@@ er case in a dec@@ ade were sitting in a c@@ ar talking and lis@@ tening to mu@@ si@@ c when they were sho@@ t , according to police reports rele@@ ased Th@@ urs@@ day .
Ang@@ el@@ a Ro@@ ch@@ ell@@ e lin@@ er , S@@ te@@ f@@ an@@ i@@ e R@@ . E@@ ll@@ is and E@@ ll@@ is &apos; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter Mal@@ e@@ a@@ h were sho@@ t on June 12 while the c@@ ar was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , authorities said .
the g@@ un@@ man fi@@ red as many as eight sho@@ ts from a hand@@ gu@@ n while standing on the passeng@@ er side of the c@@ ar then f@@ led in another vehic@@ le , the report states .
police say the tri@@ ple kill@@ ing do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t appear to have been the result of a ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y because the atta@@ ck@@ er d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t take pur@@ ses or $ 2@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 in the pos@@ session of one of the ad@@ ult victims .
P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x police spo@@ kes@@ man S@@ g@@ t@@ . J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ ow@@ ard said the sho@@ ot@@ ing pro@@ mp@@ ted investig@@ ators to look at whether it was ti@@ ed to four earlier attacks .
in all , s@@ even people have been kill@@ ed and two others w@@ oun@@ ded in n@@ ine attacks in two pre@@ domin@@ antly H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods over a four@@ -@@ month period .
&quot; it &apos;s oc@@ curr@@ ing within a resid@@ ential area in fron@@ t of a home , &quot; H@@ ow@@ ard said to C@@ B@@ S aff@@ ili@@ ate K@@ P@@ H@@ O earlier this month .
the sus@@ pect is believ@@ ed to have used several vehicles , including as a la@@ te@@ -@@ 199@@ 0@@ s bro@@ wn N@@ is@@ s@@ an , a la@@ te@@ -@@ 199@@ 0@@ s b@@ lack B@@ M@@ W and a wh@@ ite C@@ ad@@ ill@@ a@@ c or L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n .
investig@@ ators have dec@@ lined to re@@ ve@@ al the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same kill@@ er .
E@@ ll@@ is , 33 , was h@@ os@@ p@@ ita@@ li@@ z@@ ed for her in@@ j@@ uri@@ es and later di@@ ed .
lin@@ er , 31 , and E@@ ll@@ is &apos; d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter Mal@@ e@@ a@@ h di@@ ed at the sc@@ ene .
a wit@@ ness told police that it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t un@@ us@@ ual for them to sit in a par@@ ked c@@ ar lis@@ tening to mu@@ si@@ c .
authorities also rele@@ ased a police report on a sho@@ ot@@ ing that tar@@ ge@@ ted an u@@ no@@ cc@@ u@@ pi@@ ed pic@@ k@@ u@@ p truc@@ k just a hal@@ f@@ -@@ h@@ our before the tri@@ ple kill@@ ing and is believ@@ ed to have been the work of the ser@@ ial kill@@ er .
investig@@ ators found bu@@ ll@@ et cas@@ ings and rec@@ over@@ ed a bu@@ ll@@ et from a se@@ at and bu@@ ll@@ et fra@@ g@@ ments from the eng@@ ine com@@ part@@ ment .
mo@@ ther of 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old with m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , E@@ d@@ mun@@ d P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to lo@@ ves sing@@ ing , to@@ ys and , of course , his mo@@ ther .
but un@@ like most of his pe@@ ers , E@@ d@@ mun@@ d has m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a gene@@ tic dis@@ order his mo@@ m E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t know about while p@@ reg@@ n@@ ant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , I can &apos;@@ t do this .
I can &apos;@@ t do this .
I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -@@ - of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , V@@ inc@@ ent , were told E@@ d@@ mun@@ d might never rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ e them , and that he might not even sur@@ vi@@ ve .
some do@@ c@@ tors w@@ ent as far as sugges@@ ting he be institution@@ ali@@ z@@ ed .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t think people did that any@@ more , &apos; &quot; P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to expla@@ ined .
E@@ d@@ mun@@ d w@@ al@@ ks with the help of a W@@ al@@ ker .
E@@ d@@ mun@@ d d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t sit up or cra@@ w@@ l until he was three , and he still do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t talk .
but he &apos;s s@@ low@@ ly meeting some mil@@ es@@ ton@@ es .
he &apos;s w@@ al@@ king with help , and rid@@ ing a b@@ ik@@ e .
he also lo@@ ves playing with his two bro@@ th@@ ers , and sing@@ ing .
E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h demonstra@@ tes the sign language E@@ d@@ mun@@ d made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;@@ re te@@ ac@@ hing him sign language , &quot; P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws .
but it &apos;s not just typ@@ ical sign language -@@ - she says E@@ d@@ mun@@ d has in@@ ven@@ ted some of his own sig@@ ns .
M@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y can ar@@ ise from a number of different conditions : gene@@ tic ones like E@@ d@@ mun@@ d &apos;s , and inf@@ ec@@ tions during p@@ reg@@ n@@ an@@ cy from vir@@ uses like me@@ as@@ les and Z@@ ik@@ a .
sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and prog@@ no@@ sis can var@@ y wid@@ ely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those inf@@ ec@@ ted with Z@@ ik@@ a .
P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the em@@ o@@ tional tol@@ l of an un@@ certain future .
I kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t really know .
I actually ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t asked for a prog@@ no@@ sis in fore@@ ver , because I d@@ on &apos;@@ t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but P@@ ic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has h@@ ope@@ ful advice for the mo@@ th@@ ers of b@@ ab@@ ies with b@@ ir@@ th def@@ ec@@ ts from Z@@ ik@@ a .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .

police say a 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y has been sho@@ t in P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia , mar@@ king the second sho@@ ot@@ ing of a 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old in the c@@ ity this week .
the child &apos;s gran@@ d@@ par@@ ents identi@@ fied him to C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Bro@@ wn .
the gran@@ d@@ par@@ ents say Bro@@ wn suffer@@ ed multi@@ ple g@@ un@@ sho@@ t w@@ oun@@ ds , including in his gro@@ in , le@@ g , arm and ab@@ d@@ omen , but was a@@ wa@@ ke when he was trans@@ ported to the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was rid@@ d@@ led with bu@@ ll@@ ets , &quot; his gran@@ d@@ mo@@ ther D@@ elo@@ res M@@ el@@ en@@ de@@ z tell@@ s the sta@@ tion .
I just can &apos;@@ t believe it .
the bo@@ y is lis@@ ted in critical condition at a h@@ os@@ p@@ ital and has under@@ gone several sur@@ ger@@ ies .
family tell@@ s the sta@@ tion he is expected to rec@@ over .
he was set to start first gra@@ de at a local el@@ ementary scho@@ ol .
Bro@@ wn was among four people sho@@ t in the Ger@@ man@@ to@@ wn sec@@ tion .
also sho@@ t were three men : two 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds and one 3@@ 2@@ -@@ year old .
one of the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old men was re@@ ported in critical condition ; the other two victims were lis@@ ted in sta@@ ble condition , according to C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia .
the child was found sho@@ t in the fron@@ t se@@ at of a c@@ ar along with the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old in critical condition , the sta@@ tion reports .
the other two victims were not in the c@@ ar and police are investig@@ ating whether any of the w@@ oun@@ ded men could be a sho@@ o@@ ter .
investig@@ ators tell@@ s C@@ B@@ S P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia it appears there was c@@ ros@@ s@@ fir@@ e between multi@@ ple g@@ un@@ men .
assa@@ ult weap@@ on@@ -@@ sty@@ le sh@@ el@@ l cas@@ ings , tra@@ ced to different assa@@ ult sty@@ le weapons , l@@ itte@@ red the sc@@ ene .
it appears that this was defin@@ i@@ tely an on@@ going b@@ attle .
there were cas@@ ings in the stre@@ et , on both sides of the si@@ de@@ w@@ al@@ k .
so it appears that there were multi@@ ple arm@@ ed comb@@ a@@ tants out here and that they were acti@@ vely eng@@ aged , &quot; P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia police C@@ ap@@ tain An@@ th@@ on@@ y G@@ in@@ al@@ di told the sta@@ tion .
multi@@ ple h@@ ous@@ es and vehicles in the area were also struc@@ k .
no ar@@ res@@ ts have been made and police are re@@ porte@@ dly re@@ vie@@ wing sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance v@@ ide@@ o .
another 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old , a g@@ ir@@ l , was h@@ it in her arm by a stra@@ y bu@@ ll@@ et Tu@@ es@@ day while playing in fron@@ t of her home in the W@@ est o@@ a@@ k lan@@ e neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
she is rec@@ over@@ ing , and police are still se@@ ar@@ ching for a sus@@ pect .
why we need S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e
that &apos;s what I call this year &apos;s W@@ omen &apos;s Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics T@@ e@@ am and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Sum@@ mer Ol@@ ymp@@ ics since 198@@ 4 and the USA has never been so domin@@ ant .
and second : this te@@ am fe@@ a@@ tures three g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts , S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s and La@@ ur@@ en &quot; L@@ au@@ ri@@ e &quot; Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z , who have been ins@@ p@@ ir@@ ing so many young g@@ ir@@ ls of col@@ or .
the ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up of this te@@ am , ro@@ und@@ ed out by A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , who is J@@ e@@ wish , and Mad@@ is@@ on K@@ o@@ ci@@ an , who is Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic , is making everyone pro@@ ud .
this te@@ am loo@@ ks , finally , like America .
it also has sol@@ id@@ i@@ fied the b@@ lack and Lat@@ ina f@@ em@@ ale presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one f@@ em@@ ale g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast has been Afric@@ an@@ -@@ American .
last year , S@@ im@@ one and G@@ ab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this is power@@ ful .
last Ol@@ ymp@@ ics , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s was a surpris@@ e Ol@@ ymp@@ ic cha@@ mp@@ ion , and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to wit@@ ness the inc@@ redi@@ ble per@@ for@@ man@@ ces of thre@@ e@@ -@@ time World cha@@ mp@@ ion S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z deli@@ ver@@ ing the une@@ x@@ pec@@ ted , yet mas@@ ter@@ ful g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics rou@@ tin@@ es .
on Th@@ urs@@ day , S@@ im@@ one bec@@ a@@ me the four@@ th stra@@ ight American to w@@ in g@@ old in the women &apos;s individual all@@ -@@ around event .
and te@@ am@@ ma@@ te A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man ear@@ ned sil@@ ver .
we are wit@@ n@@ essing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics cl@@ ass@@ es across the country .
S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e all took the same p@@ ath as A@@ ly and Mad@@ is@@ on to make the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic te@@ am .
they are the &quot; Fin@@ al Fi@@ ve &quot; because the next Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics te@@ am will only have four g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts on the te@@ am , and this is Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s last year co@@ ac@@ hing .
but the reality is that g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics is an expen@@ sive sport , and g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts primarily tra@@ in in private g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics c@@ lu@@ bs that are maintained by par@@ ents pa@@ ying the cost of the training , fac@@ ility , travel , uni@@ forms , competition fe@@ es , ho@@ te@@ l fe@@ es ( for the co@@ ac@@ hes and their g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics c@@ lu@@ bs are loc@@ ated in aff@@ lu@@ ent sub@@ ur@@ ban neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods that can support the business .
these c@@ lu@@ bs are where the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a cos@@ tly and l@@ ong@@ -@@ term commitment for the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ ts &apos; families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , co@@ ach of S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , and M@@ ag@@ gi@@ e H@@ an@@ e@@ y , co@@ ach of L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z , have both co@@ ac@@ hed their a@@ th@@ le@@ tes since they started in g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics .
we must bring more affor@@ d@@ able and acc@@ es@@ sible g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics training to the communities of coun@@ t@@ less young g@@ ir@@ ls who are ins@@ pi@@ red by S@@ im@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and L@@ au@@ ri@@ e .
I foun@@ ded my g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics found@@ ation 20 years ago .
at my Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ations , we have provided free and low@@ -@@ cost g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics , based in Har@@ le@@ m , for over 15@@ ,@@ 000 ur@@ ban y@@ outh ( primarily b@@ lack and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and have train@@ ed national and international cha@@ mp@@ ions .
in September , we will be ex@@ pan@@ ding to D@@ et@@ ro@@ it ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to provide high quality g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics to the y@@ outh that deser@@ ve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics develop@@ s streng@@ th , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine and determination for the mind .
this comb@@ ination provides li@@ fe@@ -@@ long benefits for good health , success in scho@@ ol and work .
it is the ins@@ pi@@ ration of this te@@ am that will send thousands of young g@@ ir@@ ls to take g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for g@@ ir@@ ls .
this is such an exc@@ iting time .
thank you S@@ im@@ one , A@@ ly , L@@ au@@ ri@@ e , G@@ ab@@ by and Mad@@ is@@ on for that serious show@@ case of &quot; g@@ ir@@ l P@@ ow@@ er &quot; in w@@ inning the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic te@@ am g@@ old and for mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ting so many young g@@ ir@@ ls of all back@@ grounds to begin their p@@ ath to be heal@@ thy , strong and successful young women .
j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors set to moun@@ t further strik@@ es after rejec@@ ting J@@ er@@ em@@ y H@@ un@@ t &apos;s proposal
Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispu@@ te over the changes by agre@@ eing to a re@@ for@@ med contrac@@ t with British Med@@ ical As@@ soci@@ ation officials , but 5@@ 8 per cent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors who took part in a b@@ all@@ ot had rejected it .
in July , Mr H@@ un@@ t re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed plans to impose the contrac@@ t saying the N@@ H@@ S was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be dama@@ ging for staff and pati@@ ents .
the first j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors are mo@@ ved on@@ to the new contrac@@ t , which includes changes to over@@ night and wee@@ ken@@ d working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hours .
D@@ r E@@ ll@@ en Mc@@ Court , the B@@ M@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors &quot; committee cha@@ ir , said in a statement last night : &quot; j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors still have serious concerns about the proposed contrac@@ t , particularly that it will fu@@ el the current work@@ force crisis , and that it fail@@ s to tre@@ at all do@@ c@@ tors fair@@ ly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of do@@ c@@ tors are mo@@ ved on@@ to the new contrac@@ t , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the B@@ M@@ A to resolve the dispu@@ te through talks have been met with an un@@ will@@ ing@@ ness to eng@@ age and , at times , de@@ af@@ ening sil@@ ence from the government .
this is despite a promis@@ e from J@@ er@@ em@@ y H@@ un@@ t just last month that his do@@ or is always open .
&quot; J@@ er@@ em@@ y H@@ un@@ t needs to act now , li@@ ft the im@@ position and address j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strik@@ e at the end of April saw the post@@ pon@@ ement of ne@@ arly 13@@ ,@@ 000 rou@@ tin@@ e operations and 1@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 ap@@ poin@@ tments as n@@ ur@@ ses and consul@@ tants were draf@@ ted in to provide cover for do@@ c@@ tors on the pic@@ ket line .
Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispu@@ te over the changes by agre@@ eing to a re@@ for@@ med contrac@@ t with British Med@@ ical As@@ soci@@ ation officials .
the B@@ M@@ A wants better wee@@ ken@@ d pay for the 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors who would be subject of the contrac@@ t .
Dan@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ti@@ mer , ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive of N@@ H@@ S E@@ mp@@ lo@@ yers , called on j@@ uni@@ or do@@ c@@ tors not to go ahead with any strik@@ es .
Mr Mor@@ ti@@ mer said : &quot; industrial action achiev@@ es little or nothing , but places pressure on already stre@@ t@@ ched te@@ am@@ s and services and causes wor@@ ry , dist@@ ress and dis@@ ruption for pati@@ ents , car@@ ers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the J@@ uni@@ or D@@ oc@@ tors Committee and have , along with the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of Health and others , respon@@ ded pos@@ iti@@ vely to their concerns regarding the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an role and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wing .
emplo@@ yers were h@@ ope@@ ful that the continued positive eng@@ ag@@ ement on other important to@@ pic@@ s - such as de@@ plo@@ yment , flexibility in training , additional training for those re@@ turning from care@@ er brea@@ ks , costs of training , mutual recognition of sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us , study leave and the gender pay ga@@ p in medic@@ ine - were a sign of how serious emplo@@ yers , Health E@@ duc@@ ation Eng@@ land and the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of Health were about hon@@ our@@ ing the agreements reached with the B@@ M@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day dru@@ g that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack pati@@ ents are to benefit from a £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day dru@@ g , after officials recommend@@ ed it be given to more people for longer .
An@@ ti@@ -@@ cl@@ ot@@ ting dru@@ g tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or s@@ las@@ hes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the dru@@ g is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a s@@ tro@@ ke or another attack .
N@@ H@@ S w@@ at@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g Nice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ dio@@ vas@@ c@@ ular problems .
but now N@@ H@@ S w@@ at@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g Nice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ dio@@ vas@@ c@@ ular problems .
some 14@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 people have a heart attack in Eng@@ land every year , and a quar@@ ter of these go on to have another attack or a s@@ tro@@ ke .
heart attacks and s@@ tro@@ kes are caused by the buil@@ d@@ -@@ up of f@@ at@@ ty material in ar@@ ter@@ y w@@ all@@ s to form a pla@@ que .
if the pla@@ que brea@@ ks apart it can cause a blood c@@ lot , b@@ loc@@ king blood to the heart ca@@ using a heart attack .
and if the c@@ lot dis@@ lo@@ d@@ ges it can travel in the blood stre@@ am and blo@@ ck blood flo@@ w to the b@@ ra@@ in , ca@@ using a s@@ tro@@ ke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , which is made by UK firm A@@ stra@@ Z@@ en@@ ec@@ a and sol@@ d under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduc@@ es this risk by making c@@ lo@@ ts less likely .
the draft Nice guid@@ ance , published today , recom@@ men@@ ds that people be given 90 m@@ g of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or for 12 months , followed by 6@@ 0@@ m@@ g along with as@@ p@@ ir@@ in tw@@ ice a day for another three years .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or Car@@ ole L@@ ong@@ son , direc@@ tor at the Nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availa@@ bility of effective secon@@ d@@ ary prevention treat@@ ments , as many as a quar@@ ter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or s@@ tro@@ ke - often with dev@@ asta@@ ting consequences . &quot;
fear of a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , in comb@@ ination with as@@ p@@ ir@@ in , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and s@@ tro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in prov@@ isi@@ on@@ ally recom@@ mending tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment op@@ tions available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy and safety of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or - particularly the risk of b@@ le@@ eding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guid@@ ance does not recom@@ mend treatment with it beyond that period .
P@@ C culture let vote fraud in Mus@@ li@@ m areas f@@ lou@@ rish
Ex@@ -@@ T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets ma@@ y@@ or L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man was remo@@ ved from office last year for cor@@ ruption , pro@@ mp@@ ting the government report
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to a b@@ lin@@ d e@@ ye being turned to wid@@ es@@ pread voting fraud in Mus@@ li@@ m communities , a dev@@ asta@@ ting government report re@@ ve@@ als today .
Ex@@ -@@ C@@ ab@@ in@@ et minis@@ ter S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c P@@ ic@@ kl@@ es la@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ ts the police , election w@@ at@@ c@@ hd@@ og@@ s and to@@ wn hall@@ s for ignor@@ ing evidence of elec@@ tor@@ al abuse because of &quot; over@@ -@@ sens@@ iti@@ v@@ ities about eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity and religi@@ on . &quot;
the former communities secre@@ tary , now the anti@@ -@@ cor@@ ruption t@@ sa@@ r , said the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vo@@ ters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put c@@ ord@@ ons outside p@@ oll@@ ing sta@@ tions to protect fri@@ gh@@ tened vo@@ ters .
he recom@@ men@@ ds that vo@@ ters should have to take I@@ D to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a vo@@ ter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even sugges@@ ts putting ind@@ eli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fin@@ g@@ ers as they c@@ ast their b@@ all@@ ot to prevent anyone being able to vote tw@@ ice .
greater protection should be given to wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers , S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c says .
he calls for the P@@ ress to be given greater access to coun@@ cil paper@@ s and decisions taken by u@@ no@@ ffici@@ al committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not sol@@ ely to protect against elec@@ tor@@ al fraud , but to protect local government from the broad@@ er culture of cor@@ ruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ord@@ ered by D@@ ow@@ ning S@@ tre@@ et in the wa@@ ke of the T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets voting s@@ cand@@ al in East L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
last year a special election court r@@ ul@@ ed the sitting ma@@ y@@ or , L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man , should be remo@@ ved from office following a li@@ tan@@ y of cor@@ rup@@ t and illegal practices .
the court found R@@ ah@@ man &quot; c@@ yn@@ ically per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; the religious feel@@ ing of his Mus@@ li@@ m community and sil@@ enc@@ ed his critic@@ s with acc@@ us@@ ations of racism and Isla@@ m@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
R@@ ah@@ man , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful Mus@@ lim@@ s to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were du@@ b@@ ious or the result of person@@ ation , where a person votes while pos@@ ing as some@@ one else .
S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he vo@@ ic@@ ed particular al@@ arm about pos@@ tal voting fraud - in which sen@@ i@@ or members of the Mus@@ li@@ m community were said to have exer@@ ted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their cho@@ os@@ ing .
S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c , pic@@ tu@@ red , made several recommendations to cle@@ an up the voting system including bringing your I@@ D to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the el@@ ders , especially in communities of Pak@@ is@@ tan@@ i and B@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h@@ i back@@ ground .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a b@@ lin@@ d e@@ ye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ -@@ sens@@ iti@@ v@@ ities about eth@@ n@@ ic@@ ity and religi@@ on . &quot;
S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c made 50 recommendations to cle@@ an up the system , including bann@@ ing political acti@@ vis@@ ts from hand@@ ling pos@@ tal b@@ all@@ ot paper@@ s to stop &quot; vote har@@ ves@@ ting . &quot;
the report , being considered by T@@ her@@ es@@ a May , also calls for tou@@ gh@@ er chec@@ ks on regis@@ tra@@ tion to prevent the elec@@ tor@@ al regis@@ ter being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the op@@ tions for requ@@ ir@@ ing vo@@ ters to produce I@@ D before voting .
use ind@@ eli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fin@@ g@@ ers once they c@@ ast their b@@ all@@ ot to prevent anyone voting tw@@ ice .
carry out syste@@ matic chec@@ ks on a person &apos;s nation@@ ality to ensure they are eli@@ gible to vote .
put a thre@@ e@@ -@@ year limit on requests for an autom@@ atic pos@@ tal vote .
ban political campa@@ ig@@ ners and acti@@ vis@@ ts from hand@@ ling comple@@ ted pos@@ tal votes and pos@@ tal vote en@@ vel@@ op@@ es .
give police powers to set up c@@ ord@@ ons around p@@ oll@@ ing sta@@ tions .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with inti@@ mid@@ ation under the R@@ ep@@ res@@ entation of the People Ac@@ t 198@@ 3 .
make it illegal to take pic@@ tures in p@@ oll@@ ing sta@@ tions .
make it a requirement that only Eng@@ lis@@ h is to be used in p@@ oll@@ ing sta@@ tions ( excep@@ t in W@@ al@@ es ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff en@@ force the rule that vo@@ ters go to the bo@@ oth alone .
S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c sa@@ va@@ ges the M@@ et@@ ro@@ pol@@ ita@@ n Pol@@ ice , saying it is &quot; as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing &quot; that no criminal char@@ ges were brought after the T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets case .
&quot; the election court dis@@ qualified L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man and his ag@@ ent for a li@@ tan@@ y of cor@@ rup@@ t and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found gu@@ il@@ ty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also critic@@ ises the ine@@ ffec@@ tual &quot; tic@@ k@@ -@@ bo@@ x inspec@@ tions &quot; of to@@ wn h@@ all elec@@ tor@@ al regis@@ tra@@ tion de@@ part@@ ments .
S@@ ir E@@ ri@@ c said : &quot; last year &apos;s court r@@ ul@@ ing in T@@ ow@@ er H@@ am@@ l@@ ets was a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call .
our nation has a pro@@ ud her@@ ita@@ ge as the mo@@ ther of parliaments , yet the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t s@@ pread of elec@@ tor@@ al fraud and state of den@@ ial by some bodies threa@@ ten@@ s that good re@@ pu@@ tation .

one of the most pop@@ ular compar@@ is@@ ons from L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 is undoub@@ tedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the strik@@ ing lik@@ eness between British long ju@@ mp@@ er Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ for@@ d and pop@@ ular ac@@ tor N@@ ei@@ l Pat@@ ric@@ k Har@@ r@@ is .

P@@ r@@ im@@ ar@@ k sh@@ op@@ per ou@@ tra@@ ged at w@@ oman who b@@ ra@@ z@@ en@@ ly tried on under@@ we@@ ar in the m@@ iddle of the sho@@ p

to make it even worse , she sized up how she lo@@ ok@@ ed in them , pe@@ el@@ ed them off and put them back on the sh@@ elf .
she carried on bro@@ w@@ sing and even@@ tually tried on four pa@@ ir@@ s of under@@ we@@ ar at the stor@@ e in B@@ ou@@ ver@@ i@@ e place sh@@ opp@@ ing centre , F@@ ol@@ kes@@ t@@ one .
the P@@ r@@ im@@ ar@@ k stor@@ e in B@@ ou@@ ver@@ i@@ e place sh@@ opp@@ ing centre , F@@ ol@@ kes@@ t@@ one , where the w@@ oman tried on k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers before putting them back on the sh@@ elf
a mo@@ ther@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two , J@@ enn@@ y D@@ av@@ id@@ son , who was in the sho@@ p at the time , said after trying on the under@@ we@@ ar the m@@ ys@@ ter@@ y w@@ oman &apos; got d@@ res@@ sed again and w@@ al@@ ked out of the stor@@ e without bu@@ ying anything . &apos;
she said : &apos; people cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t believe what they were seeing . &apos;
standing in the m@@ iddle of the sho@@ p floor , she took a pa@@ ir of k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers from the dis@@ play , s@@ tri@@ pped off her own ti@@ ghts and pan@@ ts and put them on .
&apos;@@ S@@ he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t try to find any@@ where dis@@ cre@@ et to do it - she just stood there , b@@ old as b@@ ras@@ s . &apos;
&apos;@@ E@@ ver@@ y@@ one was star@@ ing as she took the k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers off again and obviously d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t like them because she put them back on the sh@@ elf . &apos;
she did the same with three more pa@@ ir@@ s before finally decid@@ ing there was nothing she lik@@ ed and she got d@@ res@@ sed again and w@@ al@@ ked out .
&apos;@@ S@@ he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t seem to care who was w@@ at@@ ching - or think about the person who would even@@ tually bu@@ y the k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers she &apos;@@ d been trying on . &apos;
M@@ s D@@ av@@ id@@ son , 33 , who lives in the K@@ ent to@@ wn , said : &apos; how dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting to think some@@ one is going to take home k@@ n@@ ic@@ kers that another person has been we@@ aring and they ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t been cle@@ an@@ ed . &apos;
the inc@@ ident happened on Tu@@ es@@ day afternoon .

how to defend y@@ our@@ self from gu@@ n attacks using K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this v@@ ide@@ o from D@@ a@@ il@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ .@@ co@@ m might help make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we spoke to R@@ h@@ on M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i , New Yor@@ k@@ -@@ based gran@@ d@@ mas@@ ter of the K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a F@@ eder@@ ation , to find out how to deal with g@@ un@@ -@@ to@@ ting mu@@ gg@@ ers at close range .
whether you &apos;@@ re appro@@ ac@@ hed from in fron@@ t or behind , this v@@ ide@@ o will show you how to turn the tab@@ les on your mu@@ gg@@ er .
if appro@@ ac@@ hed from behind , M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your atta@@ ck@@ er and &apos; clear the line of fir@@ e &apos; .
you then g@@ ras@@ p the gu@@ n between your fore@@ arm and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der before h@@ it@@ ting them in the face with your free el@@ b@@ ow .
a k@@ ne@@ e to the gro@@ in follow@@ s , and while the atta@@ ck@@ er doub@@ les up in pain , you tw@@ ist the gu@@ n from his hands , s@@ ma@@ ck him in the face with the bar@@ re@@ l and back up , keeping the weap@@ on train@@ ed on him .
for g@@ un@@ men appro@@ ac@@ hing from the fron@@ t , it &apos;s a similar tech@@ ni@@ que - get your body out of the line of fir@@ e , gra@@ b the gu@@ n and tw@@ ist it around so the vill@@ a@@ in can &apos;@@ t fir@@ e .
at the same time , put w@@ eight on the gu@@ n and pun@@ ch the atta@@ ck@@ er in the ch@@ est , then tw@@ ist the gu@@ n from his g@@ ri@@ p before bac@@ king up and poin@@ ting it at him .
s@@ oun@@ ds tric@@ ky ?
chec@@ k the v@@ ide@@ o to see exactly how M@@ iz@@ ra@@ ch@@ i does it .
but remember that the saf@@ est way out of any mu@@ gg@@ ing - if you &apos;@@ re not a K@@ ra@@ v M@@ ag@@ a gran@@ d@@ mas@@ ter - is to hand over your cas@@ h .
tra@@ v@@ ell@@ er I@@ an W@@ right sc@@ rap@@ es his ton@@ gue along Europe &apos;s di@@ r@@ ti@@ est places for travel gu@@ ide
a British tra@@ v@@ ell@@ er has put his im@@ mu@@ ne system and ga@@ g ref@@ le@@ x to a serious test - by lic@@ king some of the di@@ r@@ ti@@ est and dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting places in Europe .
pres@@ enter and travel w@@ ri@@ ter I@@ an W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k , sc@@ rap@@ ed his ton@@ gue along a Euro note , a P@@ ic@@ c@@ ad@@ ill@@ y C@@ ir@@ c@@ us hand rail , a tra@@ in to@@ il@@ et &apos;s f@@ l@@ us@@ h bu@@ t@@ ton and a Russian public tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one to prove the streng@@ th of his im@@ mu@@ ne system .
before lic@@ king each ob@@ ject , he used a lu@@ min@@ om@@ e@@ ter to show him@@ self , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the exper@@ im@@ ent , which has be made into a fil@@ m called The L@@ ic@@ k@@ h@@ ik@@ er &apos;s Gu@@ ide to I@@ nn@@ er S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th , thre@@ w up some surpris@@ ing results .
the thought of lic@@ king a tra@@ in &apos;s f@@ l@@ us@@ h bu@@ t@@ ton used by thousands of other may be ut@@ ter@@ ly re@@ p@@ ell@@ ent , but in fact there are more bad bac@@ teri@@ a in a k@@ it@@ ch@@ en sin@@ k .
all the way along his tri@@ p through Europe , Mr W@@ right spoke to do@@ c@@ tors and med@@ ical profession@@ als about bo@@ os@@ ting g@@ ut bac@@ teri@@ a and about his own health .
for@@ tunately , nothing he lic@@ ked left him with anything more than a bad tas@@ te in his mouth .
Mr W@@ right bec@@ a@@ me known for tes@@ ting the d@@ ura@@ bility of his g@@ ut by tra@@ v@@ elling around the world and e@@ ating we@@ ir@@ d and won@@ der@@ ful things .
from public han@@ dra@@ ils in tra@@ in sta@@ tions to a to@@ il@@ et f@@ l@@ us@@ h bu@@ t@@ ton the task defin@@ i@@ tely tes@@ ted his im@@ mu@@ ne system
in the mo@@ vi@@ e made about it he said : &apos; ever since I was a ki@@ d I have been fair@@ ly care@@ free with my health and I &apos;@@ ve put all sor@@ ts of things in my mouth from so@@ il , e@@ ating wor@@ ms and mu@@ d@@ d@@ y water . &apos;
he certainly proved his re@@ pu@@ tation during the fil@@ m .
the only thing he turned down was a fil@@ thy Russian public to@@ il@@ et .
his sa@@ mp@@ le s@@ wa@@ b show@@ ed a lu@@ min@@ om@@ e@@ ter coun@@ t of over 4@@ 000 un@@ its .
by compar@@ is@@ on , f@@ res@@ h@@ ly w@@ as@@ hed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one Russian public to@@ il@@ et he ref@@ used to lic@@ k after his lu@@ min@@ om@@ e@@ ter coun@@ t was over 4@@ 000 un@@ its , when f@@ res@@ h@@ ly w@@ as@@ hed hands are less than 60
Mr W@@ right and F@@ inn@@ ish da@@ ir@@ y produc@@ er V@@ ali@@ o have produced the tra@@ v@@ ell@@ er &apos;s fil@@ m called The L@@ ic@@ k@@ h@@ ik@@ er &apos;s Gu@@ ide to I@@ nn@@ er S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th which shows the bac@@ teri@@ a coun@@ t in different place like in the ba@@ th@@ room
he said in the fil@@ m : &apos; that is close to one of the wor@@ st things I have sm@@ ell@@ ed in a to@@ il@@ et . &apos;
there &apos;s nothing more di@@ r@@ ty than that !
I &apos;@@ m not going to lic@@ k anything because it &apos;s dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting in there .
the L@@ ic@@ k@@ h@@ ik@@ er &apos;s Gu@@ ide to I@@ nn@@ er S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th was produced in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with F@@ inn@@ ish da@@ ir@@ y produc@@ er V@@ ali@@ o .
the company provided Mr W@@ right with V@@ ali@@ o G@@ ef@@ il@@ us , which contain la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a as well as vi@@ ta@@ min@@ s C and D to help bo@@ ost people &apos;s g@@ ut bac@@ teri@@ a and im@@ mu@@ ne systems .
V@@ ali@@ o &apos;s S@@ eni@@ or V@@ ice President of s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks , Ju@@ ice and New Ca@@ teg@@ or@@ ies N@@ ik@@ o V@@ u@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating to w@@ at@@ ch and at the same time explain the benefits of prob@@ io@@ tics .
we did a lot of cra@@ z@@ y b@@ ra@@ ins@@ tor@@ ming that en@@ ded in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call I@@ an . &quot;
they claim the interest in g@@ ut health is becoming a global phen@@ omen@@ on
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a b@@ ig@@ ger context - the good and bad bac@@ teri@@ a in our ever@@ yd@@ ay environment , the importance of g@@ ut health and how it &apos;s linked to the im@@ mu@@ ne system .
growing interest in g@@ ut health is a global phen@@ omen@@ on and with the docu@@ mentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
I also think the fil@@ m shows we have a great sense of hu@@ m@@ our !
T@@ om Ha@@ k@@ al@@ a , who direc@@ ted the fil@@ m , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - I would have lost my respect for I@@ an if he had lic@@ ked some of the things I asked him to , like the dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting Russian to@@ il@@ et that &apos;s shown in the fil@@ m . &apos;
naturally some things were easier to get I@@ an to lic@@ k , some were pre@@ tty tou@@ gh .
I &apos;@@ m glad we got some of those di@@ r@@ ty lic@@ ks cau@@ ght on ta@@ pe . &apos;
in a sur@@ ve@@ y conduc@@ ted in 20@@ 15 by V@@ ali@@ o , 8@@ 4 per cent of the respon@@ d@@ ents associated la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a specifically with the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the s@@ tom@@ ach and g@@ ut and 5@@ 8 per cent said they use at least occasi@@ on@@ ally products contain@@ ing added la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ teri@@ a .
family of yo@@ bs destro@@ yed S@@ al@@ tas@@ h , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all coun@@ cil house ahead of ev@@ ic@@ tion
a family of yo@@ bs left their coun@@ cil house with £ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for terroris@@ ing their neighbour@@ s .
T@@ any@@ a S@@ kel@@ d@@ on and her part@@ ner S@@ ha@@ un Tre@@ bil@@ co@@ ck have been k@@ ic@@ ked out of the proper@@ ty in S@@ al@@ tas@@ h , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all , after a long list of compla@@ ints against them .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly remo@@ ved from the proper@@ ty , sho@@ c@@ ked h@@ ous@@ ing associ@@ ations offic@@ ers found the proper@@ ty in a state of dis@@ re@@ pa@@ ir .
the w@@ all@@ s were left with g@@ ap@@ ing hol@@ es , flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ards were ri@@ pped up , ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was stre@@ wn over the floor and gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i was d@@ au@@ bed on the w@@ all@@ s .
the family have now been mo@@ ved on and are believ@@ ed to be living in a private ac@@ com@@ od@@ ation
D@@ onn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , h@@ ous@@ ing manag@@ er at Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing , said she fe@@ ared it might be beyond sa@@ ving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolu@@ te ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are for people down here and I d@@ on &apos;@@ t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to w@@ ei@@ gh up because this proper@@ ty will probably be known by the no@@ t@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ n@@ ice element of Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all .
this family are no@@ tor@@ ious and their name is no@@ tor@@ ious .
the cou@@ ple had three s@@ ons who li@@ ved at the proper@@ ty inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ tly and police say the re@@ ign of terro@@ r the family inf@@ lic@@ ted included fighting in the stre@@ et with b@@ ase@@ b@@ all b@@ ats , inti@@ mid@@ ating ne@@ ar@@ by resid@@ ents , dru@@ g use , dru@@ g dealing and excessive sh@@ ou@@ ting , argu@@ ing and s@@ we@@ aring .
S@@ kel@@ d@@ on , 4@@ 7 , whose name was on the ten@@ an@@ cy , was given an an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour order in June .
old ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was found in a number of the ro@@ oms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished
floor bo@@ ards had been pu@@ ll@@ ed up in the proper@@ ty , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbour@@ s say they were seen fighting in the stre@@ et and police were reg@@ ularly called
Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her part@@ ner for@@ ce@@ fully from the proper@@ ty this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the ev@@ ic@@ tion was ha@@ iled by reli@@ ev@@ ed neighbour@@ s who said their lives had been made a living hel@@ l .
one said : &apos; they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t care about any@@ body . &apos;
we li@@ ved next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;@@ ve seen the police down here is un@@ beli@@ e@@ va@@ ble .
&apos;@@ T@@ his morning , we cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t s@@ le@@ ep . &apos;
we got up because it was so qu@@ i@@ et here - we &apos;@@ re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lo@@ vely now that they &apos;@@ re finally gone .
A@@ d@@ am F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing &apos;s neighbour@@ ho@@ od en@@ for@@ cement manag@@ er , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have li@@ ved in the house for 20 years , with police reg@@ ularly called to the proper@@ ty
ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish and old to@@ ys have been th@@ ro@@ wn down the over@@ gro@@ wn side of the coun@@ cil house
he added : &apos; it is a sha@@ me that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as ev@@ ic@@ tion is always the last course of action that Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extre@@ me and their actions must have been terri@@ fying for her neighbour@@ s to wit@@ ness .
I appreci@@ ate all the work that has been put in by my te@@ am , D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all Pol@@ ice and members of the community who b@@ ra@@ vely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some com@@ for@@ t to the neighbour@@ s and sen@@ ds out a message that an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
Mr F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k said that the three s@@ ons had all li@@ ved at the proper@@ ty at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s .
a di@@ r@@ ty mat@@ t@@ ress left on the floor of one of the b@@ ed@@ ro@@ oms in the house after the ev@@ ic@@ tion
h@@ ous@@ ing workers will now have to clear away the pil@@ es of ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish which sur@@ round the house
in 20@@ 14 , police ra@@ id@@ ed the proper@@ ty and found more than 7@@ 0@@ g in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is as well as sc@@ al@@ es , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ al@@ ia and £ 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 in cas@@ h .
S@@ kel@@ d@@ on was fin@@ ed after ple@@ ad@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty to pos@@ session of a C@@ las@@ s B dru@@ g with inten@@ t to supply .
she claim@@ ed the money was going towards a head@@ st@@ one for her son , L@@ ee S@@ kel@@ d@@ on , who di@@ ed in a c@@ ar cr@@ as@@ h in 20@@ 13 .
after being made hom@@ eless , it is understood that T@@ any@@ a and her part@@ ner are now living in private h@@ ous@@ ing in P@@ l@@ y@@ mouth .
the w@@ all@@ s of many of the house &apos;s ro@@ oms had gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i sc@@ ra@@ w@@ led across them .
police say they will seek to ev@@ ic@@ t ten@@ ants who f@@ l@@ out the rules of their ten@@ an@@ cies
Ang@@ el@@ a c@@ row , of D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all Pol@@ ice , said the ev@@ ic@@ tion sent a clear war@@ ning to other ten@@ ants who continue to f@@ l@@ out the rules .
&apos;@@ T@@ his sen@@ ds out to those who feel that they can be@@ have without rec@@ r@@ imin@@ ation , as well as those b@@ li@@ ghted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and an@@ tis@@ o@@ cial behaviour will never be toler@@ ated by D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all Pol@@ ice , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

E@@ ks@@ ot@@ e uses the sur@@ plu@@ s to cover defic@@ it from earlier .
the part left over from that is possibly used to shor@@ ten the qu@@ e@@ ues and to bu@@ y operations for pati@@ ents .
the result for the whole year is expected to be 4@@ ,@@ 6 million euro@@ s better than planned .

the o@@ ath occasion for the 10@@ th course of special border ja@@ eg@@ ers was organised on the gar@@ ris@@ on &apos;s sport field .
70 con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts s@@ wor@@ e the o@@ ath .
the special border ja@@ eg@@ ers are train@@ ed for deman@@ ding tasks of border safety , sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and b@@ attle .
they serve for 3@@ 4@@ 7 days .
this year there were 3@@ 10 young persons applying to be special board ja@@ eg@@ ers .
2@@ 50 of them were invi@@ ted to entr@@ ance examin@@ ation .
special board ja@@ eg@@ ers have been train@@ ed in I@@ m@@ m@@ ol@@ a since 200@@ 7 .
in a ve@@ ter@@ an meeting that was organised in connection with the o@@ ath occasion had five ve@@ ter@@ ans from the war@@ time bo@@ ar@@ der tro@@ op@@ s .
the average age of those present was now 90 years .

an io@@ ta ahead of the criminal - criminal intell@@ ig@@ ence aid@@ s in sol@@ ving crimes and re@@ ve@@ als serious crimin@@ ality - E@@ S@@ S@@ .@@ f@@ i
in every 11 police de@@ part@@ ments in Fin@@ land , there has been a R@@ T@@ A uni@@ t ( criminal intell@@ ig@@ ence and analysis uni@@ t ) in operation since the beginning of 20@@ 14 .
the operation of the uni@@ t is inv@@ isi@@ ble to the outside .
in H@@ ä@@ me Pol@@ ice D@@ e@@ part@@ ment , the uni@@ t consis@@ ts of a total of four polic@@ em@@ en in La@@ h@@ ti and H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inn@@ a .
it is managed by a S@@ eni@@ or ser@@ ge@@ ant loc@@ ated in La@@ h@@ ti .
the head of the com@@ man@@ ding O@@ ffic@@ ers is an In@@ spec@@ tor in La@@ h@@ ti .
in addition , the uni@@ t has a civil@@ ian speci@@ alis@@ ing in information technology working in H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inn@@ a .
all of the uni@@ t work in pla@@ in@@ -@@ c@@ lo@@ th@@ es .
the uni@@ t has proved its us@@ ability and necess@@ ity , considers D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty Pol@@ ice C@@ hi@@ ef T@@ ero Sep@@ p@@ än@@ en .
the R@@ T@@ A uni@@ t produc@@ es different kin@@ ds of reports for the rest of the Pol@@ ice .
in H@@ ä@@ me it has , among other things , ga@@ ther@@ ed information about asylum see@@ kers .
the most recent method reform
establishing the analysis un@@ its has been the most recent reform of the Pol@@ ice methods .
the goal has been crime prevention , so that police would less often leave , si@@ ren b@@ lar@@ ing , for the crime sc@@ ene after it has been al@@ er@@ ted .
the data ga@@ ther@@ ed and analys@@ ed by the uni@@ t help@@ s to focus the daily police activities to where they are needed the most .
with the re@@ for@@ mation of the N@@ ational Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard , one criminal intell@@ ig@@ ence centre was foun@@ ded in the country , and under it three national un@@ its with an own crime intell@@ ig@@ ence uni@@ t in each police de@@ part@@ ment .
the P@@ C@@ B C@@ entr@@ e in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a oper@@ ates in contact with the N@@ ational Bu@@ rea@@ u of In@@ ves@@ tig@@ ation and manag@@ es the operations on a national level .
as the name sugges@@ ts , there are people from the Pol@@ ice , the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s and the B@@ order Gu@@ ard working in the P@@ C@@ B un@@ its .
as for R@@ T@@ A un@@ its , they work on areas divid@@ ed according to police de@@ part@@ ments , and their duty is to offer data both to local police forces and national un@@ its .
intell@@ ig@@ ence exten@@ ds outside the own area
where a single police offic@@ er knows , what has happened during their 12@@ -@@ h@@ our work shi@@ ft , the task of an R@@ T@@ A uni@@ t is to know , what is going on in the whole are of a police de@@ part@@ ment .
intell@@ ig@@ ence also exten@@ ds outside the own de@@ part@@ ment &apos;s borders , since so does the crime .
those working in an R@@ T@@ A uni@@ t have better I@@ T s@@ kill@@ s than a ran@@ k and f@@ ile police offic@@ er .
the uni@@ t aims to call the Pol@@ ice &apos;s attention to new phen@@ om@@ ena , productive crimin@@ als or crimes res@@ emb@@ ling each other by using regis@@ ters , al@@ arm as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment da@@ tab@@ ase , and obser@@ vations .
this is called seri@@ alisation , and it is one of the most important to@@ ols in criminal intell@@ ig@@ ence .
all people have their own way of operating .
the hand of a person can be seen also in their work , be it hon@@ est or criminal .
based on the tech@@ ni@@ que , a certain im@@ age is for@@ med of the person .
S@@ er@@ i@@ alisation can be per@@ for@@ med either based on the tech@@ ni@@ que or on the person , depen@@ ding on which the police have more information on .
crimin@@ als learn from their mis@@ takes
the employees in an R@@ T@@ A uni@@ t do not w@@ al@@ k around with their coll@@ ars turned up , but their work is not completely public , either .
they do not tell about the methods used by them or by the crimin@@ als , because this could result in the professional crimin@@ als developing their operations and thus seeking to fo@@ il the police &apos;s crime prevention attemp@@ ts .
the police will pub@@ lic@@ ly share the methods , if they anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate a threat from them .
one such case was the way of mar@@ king emp@@ ty a@@ part@@ ments that was used in bre@@ ak@@ -@@ ins and was re@@ ported in the beginning of the sum@@ mer .
in this method , the crimin@@ als mar@@ ked the fron@@ t do@@ or with a s@@ tic@@ k , a p@@ in or a pi@@ ece of ta@@ pe to test , whether the occu@@ pan@@ ts were really away .
P@@ re@@ -@@ trial investig@@ ation material is public at least for the parties involved .
the analysis uni@@ t has obser@@ ved that the most professional crimin@@ als learn from their mis@@ takes .
the most cle@@ ver ones order the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court official record that can for example re@@ ve@@ al that there were fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ ts found from the sc@@ ene .
the next time , the th@@ i@@ ev@@ es will use g@@ lo@@ ves .

the Pol@@ ice ga@@ th@@ ers and analys@@ es date that is used in planning the practical operations .
on the back@@ ground is the reduction of work@@ force and funding .
the first steps to@@ ward new work@@ ings were taken already 30 years ago .
the latest change was a thre@@ e@@ -@@ stage P@@ O@@ R@@ A reform that fin@@ ished by the end of year 20@@ 13 .
information beyond the borders of one &apos;s own de@@ part@@ ment and of Fin@@ land is ga@@ ther@@ ed with national cooperation .
L@@ on@@ d@@ on scho@@ ol@@ g@@ ir@@ l who join@@ ed I@@ S@@ I@@ L kill@@ ed in S@@ y@@ ria
K@@ ad@@ iz@@ a S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a , one of three British scho@@ ol@@ g@@ ir@@ ls who left L@@ on@@ d@@ on last year to join I@@ S@@ I@@ L , has re@@ porte@@ dly di@@ ed in S@@ y@@ ria .
A@@ t@@ tor@@ ne@@ y T@@ as@@ n@@ ime A@@ k@@ u@@ n@@ j@@ ee said her family lear@@ ned of her death in R@@ a@@ q@@ q@@ a , S@@ y@@ ria , a few weeks ago .
she was believ@@ ed to have been kill@@ ed by a Russian air strik@@ e in R@@ a@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s str@@ on@@ gh@@ old in the country , I@@ T@@ V Ne@@ ws re@@ ported on Th@@ urs@@ day .
S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a was 17 years old and , according to her family , di@@ ed just as she was making plans to fle@@ e the war@@ -@@ tor@@ n country and return to Bri@@ tain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tom@@ b@@ st@@ one and te@@ sta@@ ment to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dis@@ su@@ ade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; A@@ k@@ u@@ n@@ j@@ ee said .
in February 20@@ 15 , S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a and two other scho@@ ol@@ g@@ ir@@ ls from e@@ ast L@@ on@@ d@@ on bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light to Turkey and then a b@@ us to the S@@ y@@ rian border .
S@@ ul@@ tan@@ a &apos;s family was told she mar@@ ried an I@@ S@@ I@@ L fi@@ gh@@ ter in S@@ y@@ ria - and bec@@ a@@ me a wid@@ ow within months .
R@@ ei@@ d says C@@ lin@@ ton will s@@ tic@@ k with G@@ ar@@ land as Su@@ pre@@ me Court n@@ om@@ ine@@ e if elected

R@@ ei@@ d said on a conference call Th@@ urs@@ day that he is pre@@ dic@@ ting C@@ lin@@ ton will pic@@ k G@@ ar@@ land &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spo@@ kes@@ w@@ oman for R@@ ei@@ d later said he had not spoken to C@@ lin@@ ton directly about whether she would n@@ omin@@ ate G@@ ar@@ land and was spec@@ ula@@ ting .
he p@@ raised G@@ ar@@ land and said C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s te@@ am would not want to &quot; ro@@ ck the bo@@ at &quot; with a new pic@@ k .
G@@ ar@@ land is the ch@@ i@@ ef jud@@ ge for the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t of C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia cir@@ cu@@ it .

V@@ in@@ y@@ l des@@ tin@@ ation : who is actually bu@@ ying rec@@ or@@ ds ?
l@@ on@@ ely , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men lo@@ ve vin@@ y@@ l .
before you r@@ us@@ h to l@@ itte@@ r the comments sec@@ tion with gn@@ arly in@@ sul@@ ts under the p@@ se@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ m N@@ ot@@ A@@ ll@@ L@@ on@@ el@@ y@@ M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ Ag@@ ed@@ M@@ en , this statement der@@ iv@@ es from actual data .
according to Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v , the much tal@@ ke@@ d@@ -@@ about record res@@ urg@@ ence is dri@@ ven not by a bo@@ om in mill@@ en@@ ni@@ als who want to emb@@ ra@@ ce the no@@ vel@@ ty of a p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal item , but by mid@@ life nos@@ tal@@ gia .
those who have recently pur@@ ch@@ ased a vin@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m are most likely to be aged between 45 and 5@@ 4 , appar@@ ently .
in fact , those in the 18@@ -@@ 24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of ho@@ ar@@ ding by ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists , either - it has em@@ o@@ tional signific@@ ance : ol@@ der vin@@ y@@ l bu@@ yers are sli@@ ghtly more likely to keep their feel@@ ings to themselves ( 5@@ 6 % ver@@ su@@ s 5@@ 3 % ) and enjo@@ y being alone ( 6@@ 9 % ver@@ su@@ s 6@@ 6 % ) .
but are Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results true ?
if this blo@@ g was a tel@@ ev@@ ised ne@@ ws report , the ca@@ mer@@ a would follow me as I w@@ al@@ ked down the m@@ iddle of a bus@@ y S@@ oh@@ o stre@@ et , we@@ aring a mod@@ est gre@@ y su@@ it and g@@ es@@ turing w@@ il@@ dly before sto@@ pp@@ ing , c@@ up@@ ping my hands and saying something author@@ ita@@ tive like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of S@@ oh@@ o is s@@ low@@ ly being dra@@ ined of its char@@ m and gro@@ t - ho@@ tel@@ s , e@@ ats , P@@ re@@ ts and Pa@@ per@@ ch@@ ases now f@@ ill the buil@@ dings once occu@@ pi@@ ed by independent sell@@ ers - a hand@@ ful of f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic speci@@ alist record sh@@ op@@ s still remain .
I &apos;@@ d probably ask the ca@@ mer@@ a to stop ro@@ ll@@ ing for the next bit , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these sto@@ res and attempt to g@@ au@@ ge their age and em@@ o@@ tional dis@@ position via obser@@ vation .
G@@ las@@ we@@ gian S@@ tu@@ ar@@ t , 55 , whom I follow from sis@@ ter R@@ ay ( data coun@@ t : two young women , three mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men ) into rec@@ kl@@ ess R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds ( data coun@@ t : eight mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men , one w@@ oman , probably in her 20@@ s ) is in L@@ on@@ d@@ on for the afternoon for a meeting and is per@@ us@@ ing the sh@@ op@@ s to f@@ ill a few hours .
is he a collec@@ tor , I ask ?
&quot; I sup@@ pose I am , &quot; he says .
I have about 3@@ ,@@ 000 or 4@@ ,@@ 000 rec@@ or@@ ds .
these rec@@ or@@ ds , pic@@ tu@@ red above ( he em@@ a@@ iled me the s@@ na@@ p , I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t follow him home ) , line his living room w@@ all@@ s .
his reason for acqu@@ ir@@ ing such a vas@@ t number of al@@ bu@@ ms and sing@@ les is partly a result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to bu@@ y rec@@ or@@ ds he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t affor@@ d when they origin@@ ally came out , and to re@@ pur@@ ch@@ ase ite@@ ms he sol@@ d when he was young and s@@ kin@@ t .
&quot; a lot of the stu@@ ff I get is late 6@@ 0@@ s , early 7@@ 0@@ s , things that came out when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who pur@@ ch@@ ase rec@@ or@@ ds are more likely to be in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts who like their own company , ad@@ ding : &quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t smo@@ ke , I d@@ on &apos;@@ t d@@ rin@@ k very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
W@@ e@@ z , 25 , who works at sis@@ ter R@@ ay , also believes that many of the custom@@ ers he en@@ coun@@ ters f@@ it the Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v prof@@ ile .
he has , however , no@@ tic@@ ed a new wa@@ ve of people influ@@ enc@@ ed by the media hy@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ e@@ back and felt comp@@ ell@@ ed to bu@@ y back their old rec@@ or@@ ds .
from conver@@ sa@@ tions I &apos;@@ ve had , people have got ri@@ d of their collec@@ tion , nor@@ m@@ ally around 1998 or 1999 .
custom@@ ers who once sol@@ d their vin@@ y@@ l to bu@@ y C@@ D@@ s are now sell@@ ing their C@@ D@@ s to bu@@ y their rec@@ or@@ ds back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a bo@@ om in vin@@ y@@ l re@@ vi@@ val@@ ists of a certain age .
but what about the all@@ eg@@ ed em@@ o@@ tional importance of rec@@ or@@ ds ?
it takes a few secon@@ ds in a sho@@ p such as P@@ hon@@ ic@@ a to realise that record sto@@ res offer a com@@ for@@ ting community of lik@@ em@@ in@@ ded types .
according to W@@ e@@ z , some ol@@ der custom@@ ers have taken um@@ b@@ ra@@ ge with the contac@@ t@@ less payment system in particular .
some vin@@ y@@ l f@@ ans may feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by the dig@@ ital world and choose to re@@ tre@@ at to the stability of the fam@@ ili@@ ar record s@@ le@@ eve , of ite@@ ms that rec@@ all hal@@ cy@@ on te@@ en@@ age m@@ em@@ or@@ ies .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be fill@@ ing a vo@@ id or having material pos@@ s@@ es@@ sions as some kind of com@@ for@@ t , &quot; W@@ e@@ z says .
as a collec@@ tor myself , I have that , and I think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occ@@ up@@ y your head@@ space .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re like their social workers ! &quot; pi@@ p@@ es up a co@@ -@@ wor@@ ker from a sta@@ ck of rec@@ or@@ ds .
an IC@@ M pol@@ l in April re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that almost 50 % of people who b@@ ought a vin@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m the previous month had yet to lis@@ ten to it .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a tur@@ n@@ table they never use , while 7 % of those who pur@@ ch@@ ase vin@@ y@@ l d@@ on &apos;@@ t own a record pla@@ yer .
at this stage of the ne@@ ws report , I would probably be looking gra@@ vely concerned while f@@ lic@@ king through a sta@@ ck of b@@ ossa N@@ o@@ va com@@ pi@@ la@@ tions .
the &quot; tro@@ ph@@ y &quot; aspect of the re@@ vi@@ val is something that J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in s@@ oun@@ ds of the uni@@ ver@@ se ( data coun@@ t : three mid@@ de@@ -@@ aged men ) has no@@ tic@@ ed .
&quot; some@@ one came in recently and said : &quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t have a record pla@@ yer , but I want to bu@@ y a R@@ ad@@ io@@ head record so we can put it on our sh@@ elf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large perc@@ enta@@ ge , but it &apos;s defin@@ i@@ tely happening .
more of the product side , less of the mu@@ si@@ c .
we have people saying : &quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t have a record pla@@ yer . &quot;
that &apos;s youn@@ ger people , not ol@@ der ones , late te@@ ens who are just getting into it .
F@@ op@@ p , which now d@@ ed@@ ic@@ ates almost an entire floor to vin@@ y@@ l , has a far more vari@@ ed au@@ di@@ ence when I arri@@ ve .
there are cou@@ ples in their 7@@ 0@@ s , tou@@ ris@@ ts taking p@@ ho@@ to@@ s , te@@ en@@ age bo@@ ys and mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged women .
while the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here is less at e@@ ase than the a@@ fore@@ mentioned sto@@ res - W@@ il@@ d be@@ ast &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ - and sex@@ -@@ fu@@ ell@@ ed po@@ p , rather than no@@ od@@ ling ja@@ z@@ z , is b@@ las@@ ting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its custom@@ ers .
n@@ one of them look particularly l@@ on@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ging p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological tra@@ u@@ ma is hard to as@@ certain by standing next to some@@ one for 30 secon@@ ds .
E@@ lan@@ or@@ a , 27 , has been w@@ al@@ king around F@@ op@@ p for a few minu@@ tes , looking at the vari@@ ety of rec@@ or@@ ds on s@@ ale .
she is w@@ in@@ do@@ w@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing , rather than on a spending s@@ pre@@ e .
she do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t ear@@ n a lot , she says , so collec@@ ting rec@@ or@@ ds is@@ n &apos;@@ t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to lis@@ ten to mu@@ si@@ c by a com@@ pu@@ ter or another way , but the be@@ au@@ ty of vin@@ y@@ l is ... &quot; she dri@@ f@@ ts off into a lo@@ ves@@ truc@@ k si@@ gh .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t know how to explain - it &apos;s really uni@@ que .
my last stop is a sho@@ p said to have ins@@ pi@@ red a f@@ res@@ h generation of vin@@ y@@ l lo@@ vers : ur@@ ban O@@ ut@@ f@@ it@@ ters .
while giving the ill@@ u@@ sion of per@@ us@@ ing the d@@ eni@@ m ho@@ t pan@@ ts , I obser@@ ve a group of te@@ en@@ age g@@ ir@@ ls , who cl@@ us@@ ter around the Pol@@ ar@@ o@@ id ca@@ mer@@ as mom@@ en@@ tar@@ ily , before a d@@ ad and his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter deliber@@ ate pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing a C@@ ros@@ le@@ y record pla@@ yer .
to the left is a sta@@ ir@@ well , a w@@ all of which is sta@@ c@@ ked with rec@@ or@@ ds by A@@ del@@ e , J@@ ef@@ f B@@ uc@@ k@@ le@@ y , A@@ my W@@ in@@ eh@@ ouse and F@@ le@@ et@@ w@@ ood Ma@@ c : a mi@@ x of con@@ temporary and classi@@ c@@ s , the essential rec@@ or@@ ds for any average collec@@ tion .
no@@ body is looking - perhaps because they are merely dec@@ or@@ ation , some so high up the w@@ all that it would be impossible to tou@@ ch them .
it is pur@@ e &quot; ar@@ t vin@@ y@@ l . &quot;
but , given that any at@@ trac@@ tion to these ite@@ ms could mean more money for the industry and send a few custom@@ ers into the de@@ p@@ ths of S@@ oh@@ o for more , there is little to compla@@ in about .
it is no surpris@@ e that a dem@@ ogra@@ p@@ hi@@ c more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spen@@ ds the most on lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y ite@@ ms such as vin@@ y@@ l .
but while my fin@@ dings suggest Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results are acc@@ ura@@ te , in S@@ oh@@ o record sto@@ res at least , they do not dis@@ coun@@ t the huge number of f@@ em@@ ale collec@@ tors and vin@@ y@@ l lo@@ vers that exist in reality , in record sh@@ op@@ s and on on@@ line for@@ u@@ ms .
these people are probably working hard at scho@@ ol or in offic@@ es .
they are certainly not spending their Th@@ urs@@ day mor@@ n@@ ings lo@@ i@@ tering around the record sh@@ op@@ s of Ber@@ w@@ ic@@ k S@@ tre@@ et , f@@ lic@@ king through rec@@ or@@ ds and avoid@@ ing the ga@@ z@@ e of a cre@@ ep@@ y , 3@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old fa@@ ke television pres@@ enter who is lo@@ om@@ ing over the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of un@@ sus@@ pec@@ ting mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects b@@ id to dem@@ ol@@ ish sh@@ op@@ s at J@@ un@@ g@@ le refuge@@ e cam@@ p
a French court has rejected a b@@ id by C@@ ala@@ is authorities to dem@@ ol@@ ish do@@ z@@ ens of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ op@@ s and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants in the J@@ un@@ g@@ le cam@@ p where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hear@@ ing this week , C@@ ala@@ is authorities had argu@@ ed the state should be able to kno@@ ck down a total of 7@@ 2 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ op@@ s where people in@@ side the cam@@ p sel@@ l goods , from ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes to energy d@@ rin@@ ks , offer ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts , or sel@@ l te@@ a for 50 c@@ ents ( 4@@ 0@@ p ) or basic me@@ als for a few euro@@ s in ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants .
the C@@ ala@@ is pre@@ f@@ ec@@ t &apos;s office argu@@ ed the places should be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they represented a par@@ all@@ el economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fir@@ e and san@@ itation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the sh@@ op@@ s and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants were vital , saying the free me@@ als offer@@ ed by a sta@@ te@@ -@@ bac@@ ked association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing num@@ bers at the cam@@ p .
they argu@@ ed the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ op@@ s and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants often provided sh@@ el@@ ter and free me@@ als to those in need .
a L@@ ill@@ e court r@@ ul@@ ed there was no legal basis for ex@@ p@@ elling the people running the 7@@ 2 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft sh@@ op@@ s , but said the C@@ ala@@ is pre@@ f@@ ec@@ t &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally under@@ stand@@ able . &quot;
the jud@@ ge , J@@ e@@ an@@ -@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is M@@ oll@@ a , said the gro@@ cer@@ ies , c@@ af@@ es and res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants played a much b@@ ig@@ ger role than simply fe@@ eding people that &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ar@@ ious conditions . &quot;
he said the sp@@ ac@@ es provided cal@@ m meeting points between refugees and volun@@ te@@ ers .
one of the places that had been under threat from dem@@ ol@@ ition was the cam@@ p &apos;s J@@ un@@ g@@ le Bo@@ ok kid@@ s &quot; C@@ af@@ e which is run no@@ t@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ prof@@ it and provides 200 me@@ als a day , Eng@@ lis@@ h and French cl@@ ass@@ es , and asylum advice for the hund@@ re@@ ds of v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able un@@ ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed min@@ ors in the cam@@ p .

the price of the food in Fin@@ land dro@@ ps clearly fas@@ ter than the EU average
food becom@@ es strik@@ ingly che@@ aper in Fin@@ land - a source of jo@@ y for consumers and of an@@ no@@ y@@ ance to producers .
the price of food in Fin@@ land has dro@@ pped ne@@ arly 5 per cent in three years , when the average price dro@@ p in EU countries was 0.@@ 9 per cent .
at the same time food in Germany and Sweden is one per cent more expen@@ sive .
during the last three years , the price of food in Fin@@ land has dro@@ pped the second most in those EU countries that have the same w@@ age level than Fin@@ land .
from the an@@ alogue countries &quot; only Bri@@ tain &apos;s food prices have gone down fas@@ ter than in Fin@@ land .
this data was shown in an ar@@ ticle by sen@@ i@@ or advis@@ er I@@ l@@ k@@ ka L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen from Sta@@ tis@@ tics Fin@@ land that was published in Ti@@ e@@ to &a@@ mp@@ ; T@@ r@@ end@@ it ( D@@ a@@ ta &a@@ mp@@ ; T@@ ren@@ ds ) blo@@ g .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen compared real prices , prices that are in propor@@ tion to the general development of the consumer prices .
the latest data is from June this year .
in the beginning of the 20@@ 10@@ s , the price of the food ro@@ se shar@@ ply .
in 20@@ 13 , the prices ro@@ se close to the price level of 1994 .
the situation was al@@ arm@@ ing .
&quot; we were close to los@@ ing that price advantage we got from EU membership , &quot; L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen says .
then a change followed , after which food has become che@@ aper year by year .
now the price is w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed down by the food im@@ port prohi@@ b@@ itions set by Russia that brought food im@@ port from Fin@@ land to Russia to a stand@@ still .
that is why the supply of da@@ ir@@ y and meat products has increased in the F@@ inn@@ ish market , and the produc@@ er prices have dro@@ pped .
&quot; P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s policies have help@@ ed the F@@ inn@@ ish consumer in the short term , &quot; says L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen .
also the competition between industry and trade has ste@@ pped up and affected the price dro@@ p .
the large cha@@ ins , S Group and K@@ es@@ ko , have both reduced their prices .
for the consumer the price competition has appe@@ ared as im@@ pres@@ sive adver@@ tis@@ ing campa@@ ig@@ ns .
Fin@@ land still is no se@@ at of affor@@ d@@ able nou@@ ris@@ hment , even though the price of the food has dro@@ pped signific@@ antly .
in 20@@ 15 , the food prices in Fin@@ land were the four@@ th most expen@@ sive from those EU countries that have the same kind of w@@ age level than Fin@@ land .
according to L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen , the food prices in Fin@@ land are consider@@ ably affected by the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax .
he dis@@ covered that if the control countries would have the same perc@@ enta@@ ge of valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax , Fin@@ land would have the third che@@ ap@@ est food from the countries that have the same w@@ age level .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen compared Fin@@ land with Denmark , Sweden , Austria , France , Italy , Bri@@ tain , Germany , and the Netherlands .
if the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax in the control countries would be s@@ even , only the Ger@@ man@@ s and the D@@ ut@@ ch would sel@@ l che@@ aper food than the F@@ inn@@ s .
&quot; if we want to get to the same food price level with the old EU countries , we have to hal@@ ve the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax to the average EU country level , and to continue price competition , &quot; L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen w@@ ri@@ tes .
L@@ eh@@ t@@ inen points out that the cal@@ c@@ ula@@ tions he did with the valu@@ e@@ -@@ added tax perc@@ enta@@ ge are appro@@ x@@ imate .
the scho@@ ol is not quite what it used to be
those re@@ turning to scho@@ ol may no@@ tice that there has been a change in scho@@ ol during the sum@@ mer .
a new te@@ ac@@ hing curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum has been created for scho@@ ols , and it will be implemented in the beginning of the sem@@ es@@ ter in all primary scho@@ ols .
they are the guidelines that go@@ ver@@ n all F@@ inn@@ ish scho@@ ols .
the scho@@ ols decide on the details themselves , but the curr@@ ic@@ u@@ lum states the official goals .
these guidelines have been prepared for several years , and they di@@ ffer from the old ones in many ways .
for example cur@@ sive hand@@ wr@@ iting will not be tau@@ ght any@@ more , and instead cod@@ ing will be prac@@ tis@@ ed at scho@@ ols .
ins@@ truc@@ tion in Swedish will begin on the si@@ x@@ th gra@@ de the latest , and social studies will begin already on the four@@ th gra@@ de .
the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est change , however , concerns the role of the pu@@ p@@ ils .
before it was thought that a te@@ ac@@ her te@@ ac@@ hes the pu@@ p@@ ils , but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another .
this is an attempt to make education more interesting .
the l@@ ong@@ est li@@ ved ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the world was found - the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k can live up to 4@@ 00 years
the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k ( S@@ om@@ ni@@ os@@ us m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ ep@@ h@@ alu@@ s ) , also known as the gre@@ y shar@@ k , does not reach its sexual ma@@ tur@@ ity until it is 1@@ 50 years old .
it can live 2@@ 50 years after that , a new study re@@ ported .
these num@@ bers make this spec@@ ies to be the l@@ ong@@ est li@@ ved ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate in the modern world .
in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom there is only one who pass@@ es it : the ol@@ des@@ t oc@@ ean qu@@ a@@ ho@@ g known has been estima@@ ted to be 5@@ 0@@ 7 years old .
Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ ks s@@ wi@@ m around the North A@@ tlantic .
they also hold another record : they are also the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est fish in the Ar@@ c@@ tic area .
the f@@ em@@ al@@ es are tall@@ er than the mal@@ es , as they can gro@@ w to be over five met@@ res tal@@ l .
since the rate of growth is s@@ low , only about a c@@ enti@@ met@@ re a year according to monitoring , the ad@@ ult spec@@ im@@ ens must have li@@ ved a long life .
but how long ?
Ju@@ li@@ us Niel@@ sen from the Uni@@ versity of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out .
he determined the ages of 28 ad@@ ult f@@ em@@ ale Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ ks that had been tra@@ pped in fishermen &apos;s n@@ ets .
the age of the fish was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed in radi@@ oc@@ ar@@ bon d@@ ating their e@@ ye l@@ ens@@ es .
the average age of the stu@@ di@@ ed shar@@ ks was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed to be at least 2@@ 7@@ 2 years .
the two larg@@ est fish in the sa@@ mp@@ le , the a@@ ma@@ z@@ on@@ -@@ sized fish of 4@@ 9@@ 3 and 5@@ 02 c@@ enti@@ met@@ res long , were re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed to 3@@ 35 and 3@@ 9@@ 2 years old respec@@ tively .
since the other studies have found out that the Gre@@ en@@ land shar@@ k f@@ em@@ al@@ es do not reach ma@@ tur@@ ity until they are over 4 met@@ res long , the res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers cal@@ c@@ ula@@ ted they are about 1@@ 50 years old at that stage .
the study was published by S@@ ci@@ ence .
Stock@@ man@@ n a@@ x@@ es up rou@@ gh@@ ly 300 employees - the number of sal@@ es assis@@ tants sta@@ ys the same
ne@@ arly 300 employees are laid off from the de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e company Stock@@ man@@ n .
the consul@@ ta@@ tive negotiations in the company that has g@@ ot@@ ten into difficulties fin@@ ished in the beginning of A@@ ug@@ ust .
&quot; as a result of the negotiations , appro@@ xim@@ ately 300 jobs will be cut , main part of the cu@@ ts will be carried out as la@@ y@@ -@@ off@@ s , &quot; Stock@@ man@@ n says in its press rele@@ ase .
it is also said in the press rele@@ ase that the number of de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e sal@@ es assis@@ tants will not be reduced to ensure excellent custom@@ er service .
Stock@@ man@@ n will also offer around 80 members of its support staff new positions as sal@@ es assis@@ tants .
Stock@@ man@@ n &apos;s negotiations concerned about 3@@ 000 employees .
when they beg@@ an , the need for cu@@ ts was estima@@ ted to be about 3@@ 80 employees .
the cu@@ ts are expected to gener@@ ate annual cost sa@@ v@@ ings of rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 million euro@@ s that are sup@@ posed to realise during next year .
already earlier Stock@@ man@@ n has be@@ gu@@ n an efficiency programme , with which they attempt to create sa@@ v@@ ings of 50 million euro@@ s this year .
on the back@@ ground are Stock@@ man@@ n &apos;s difficulties to make de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e sal@@ es prof@@ itable .
even though the group &apos;s adjus@@ ted operating result improved to 11@@ .@@ 1 million euro@@ s in the second quar@@ ter of the year , the de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e sal@@ es are still un@@ prof@@ itable .
La@@ ur@@ i V@@ ei@@ j@@ ala@@ inen , the care@@ ta@@ ker ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive of Stock@@ man@@ n says that the sal@@ es per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of the de@@ part@@ ment sto@@ res has continued to fall short of expectations .
&quot; person@@ nel reduc@@ tions are unfortunately a necessary step to ensure that Stock@@ man@@ n &apos;s re@@ ta@@ il div@@ ision achiev@@ es a positive result in 20@@ 18 , &quot; V@@ ei@@ j@@ ala@@ inen says in the press rele@@ ase .
the improved secon@@ d@@ -@@ quar@@ ter result is particularly a consequ@@ ence of the sol@@ id per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of fas@@ hi@@ on cha@@ in L@@ inde@@ x .
the cha@@ in re@@ ported the best secon@@ d@@ -@@ quar@@ ter tur@@ no@@ ver and result in its history .
L@@ inde@@ x &apos;s prof@@ it increased 9@@ .@@ 5 million euro@@ s to 2@@ 8@@ .@@ 1 million euro@@ s .
at the same time last year , the operating result of the whole Stock@@ man@@ n Group had a los@@ s of 4@@ .@@ 1 million .
Stock@@ man@@ n estima@@ tes that the Group &apos;s tur@@ no@@ ver this year will be small@@ er than last year .
the adjus@@ ted operating result is expected to be sli@@ ghtly positive this year .

K@@ en@@ y@@ a &apos;s a@@ th@@ le@@ tics te@@ am is sha@@ ken by a d@@ op@@ ing s@@ cand@@ al - an od@@ d explanation to a co@@ ach &apos;s move
a K@@ en@@ y@@ an a@@ th@@ le@@ tics co@@ ach , Joh@@ n An@@ z@@ ra@@ h , has been sent home from Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics after he was found to have been pos@@ ing as a national te@@ am a@@ th@@ l@@ ete in d@@ op@@ ing tes@@ ts .
the ne@@ ws agency A@@ P said that the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete An@@ z@@ ra@@ h was pres@@ enting him@@ self as was the 8@@ 00@@ m sta@@ r Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en Ara@@ p so@@ i , who is part of K@@ en@@ y@@ a &apos;s national te@@ am management , said that An@@ z@@ ra@@ h &apos;s id@@ entity was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed after he had given a sa@@ mp@@ le as Ro@@ ti@@ ch in a surpris@@ e test .
the d@@ op@@ ing officials re@@ ported An@@ z@@ ra@@ h to the authorities .
according to so@@ i , An@@ z@@ ra@@ h was sent home because he &quot; committed his crime against te@@ am K@@ en@@ y@@ a . &quot;
&quot; he presented him@@ self as an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete , gave the ur@@ ine sa@@ mp@@ le and even signed the documents .
we cannot toler@@ ate such behaviour , &quot; grow@@ led Ki@@ p K@@ e@@ ino , chairman of the N@@ ational Ol@@ ymp@@ ic Committee of K@@ en@@ y@@ a to the ne@@ ws agency Re@@ u@@ ters .
the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic a@@ th@@ le@@ tics beg@@ ins on F@@ rid@@ ay , and Ro@@ ti@@ ch is to run already on that day .
there is no information yet about whether the run@@ ner fac@@ es some consequences about the inc@@ ident .
last year at the world cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship Ro@@ ti@@ ch was four@@ th on this dis@@ tance , and is one of the fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes to w@@ in in Ri@@ o .
according to Re@@ u@@ ters , a source from in@@ side the K@@ en@@ y@@ an a@@ th@@ le@@ tics te@@ am claim@@ ed that An@@ z@@ ra@@ h only used the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s acc@@ redi@@ tation c@@ ard to get free bre@@ ak@@ fas@@ ts in the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s vill@@ age .
when he met the anti@@ -@@ d@@ op@@ ing officials , they expected him to be an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete , and he was taken to a test .
the co@@ ach did not explain the situation to the officials , because he was af@@ ra@@ id of being ex@@ posed .
where is everyone ?
the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics sta@@ di@@ um in Ri@@ o is emp@@ ty
indeed , where is everyone ?
they are certainly not at the Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ic sta@@ di@@ um w@@ at@@ ching a@@ th@@ le@@ tics .
the b@@ attle for a@@ th@@ le@@ tics med@@ als in Ri@@ o beg@@ an on F@@ rid@@ ay , but the world &apos;s top individuals got to show@@ case their tal@@ ents to conf@@ us@@ ingly emp@@ ty stands .
the organis@@ ers of Ri@@ o told on F@@ rid@@ ay that only 5@@ 8 per cent of the first day &apos;s morning competition tic@@ ket@@ s and 65 per cent of the evening competition tic@@ ket@@ s have been sol@@ d .
the situation was different four years ago in L@@ on@@ d@@ on , where the sta@@ di@@ um was bur@@ s@@ ting with che@@ ering people .
the fin@@ als tic@@ ket are sol@@ d out already also at Ri@@ o .
the spec@@ ta@@ tor los@@ s at Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics has at@@ trac@@ ted attention already before a@@ th@@ le@@ tics .
there have been thousands of emp@@ ty se@@ ats for example in ru@@ g@@ by , can@@ o@@ eing , and rid@@ ing stands .
when the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian med@@ al hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ s T@@ al@@ ita An@@ tun@@ es and L@@ ar@@ is@@ sa fran@@ c@@ a played be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y at leg@@ end@@ ary C@@ op@@ ac@@ ab@@ ana , only 70 per cent of the stands were full .
after the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian du@@ o , the Netherlands played against Russia , and only about 30 per cent of the stands that se@@ at 12@@ .@@ 000 people were full .
the bad sal@@ es are partly expla@@ ined by the fact that B@@ ra@@ z@@ il with its economic difficulties is far away for the European and A@@ sian Ol@@ ymp@@ ic tou@@ ris@@ ts , and many of the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic s@@ ports are str@@ an@@ ge to B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans , who are acc@@ us@@ tom@@ ed to foot@@ b@@ all .
however , not even the first mat@@ ch of the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian foot@@ b@@ all te@@ am managed to f@@ ill the foot@@ b@@ all sta@@ di@@ um .
the spo@@ kes@@ man for the ga@@ me organis@@ ers , Mar@@ io An@@ dra@@ da , said this wee@@ ken@@ d that at that time , 8@@ 2 per cent of the tic@@ ket@@ s had been sol@@ d , a number that is clearly small@@ er than four years ago .
&quot; there are still 1.@@ 1 million tic@@ ket@@ s left to be sol@@ d , &quot; An@@ dra@@ da said according to Re@@ u@@ ters .
from the 8@@ .@@ 5 million tic@@ ket@@ s in the L@@ on@@ d@@ on Ol@@ ymp@@ ics 8@@ .@@ 2 million were sol@@ d , even though they were almost half more expen@@ sive than in Ri@@ o .
in Ri@@ o , the tic@@ ket prices have vari@@ ed from about n@@ ine euro@@ s to over a thou@@ s@@ and euro@@ s for the opening .
over half of the tic@@ ket@@ s cost under 16 euro@@ s .
in L@@ on@@ d@@ on Ol@@ ymp@@ ics , the voluntary workers and ar@@ my person@@ nel were allowed to sit on the emp@@ ty se@@ ats , but in Ri@@ o this has not been allowed yet , as the organis@@ ers need money and attempt to sel@@ l the tic@@ ket@@ s until the very last moment .
however , in Ri@@ o , the organis@@ ers have given scho@@ ol children 2@@ 4@@ 0.@@ 000 tic@@ ket@@ s for those s@@ ports that are less known in the country , like g@@ old and ru@@ g@@ by .
there were pl@@ enty of emp@@ ty se@@ ats in the Ri@@ o Sta@@ di@@ um in the morning .
even be@@ ach vo@@ ll@@ e@@ y at the san@@ ds of C@@ op@@ ac@@ ab@@ ana did not interest the au@@ di@@ ence .

a new way to protect the nature - bu@@ y a right to a pi@@ ece of land
Hel@@ sin@@ ki F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation has new ways to take part in nature con@@ ser@@ vation .
the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , established last year , acqu@@ i@@ res ec@@ olog@@ ically significant areas of land .
after that , private people , companies , and communities can pur@@ ch@@ ase guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship rights to a blo@@ ck of land .
the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation &apos;s first land proper@@ ty is loc@@ ated in L@@ ap@@ land .
the land proper@@ ty is vir@@ tually sub@@ divid@@ ed into small Gre@@ ens@@ pac@@ es , and those who want , can bu@@ y a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship right to a Gre@@ ens@@ p@@ ace .
the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an has ve@@ to rights to their space of 18@@ 7 s@@ qu@@ are met@@ res , which in prac@@ t@@ ise means that if the large land blo@@ ck &apos;s purpose is to be changed , a per@@ mission from each Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an is required .
it is possible also to bu@@ y Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ ships for several Gre@@ ens@@ pac@@ es .
bu@@ ying a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship is something tan@@ gible you can pass down or give as a gi@@ ft .
&quot; there is no need to carry bann@@ ers or to cha@@ in y@@ our@@ self to something in order to protect the nature , &quot; expla@@ ins J@@ uh@@ a Le@@ vi@@ ä@@ k@@ an@@ gas , who acqu@@ ired a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship for his company .
those who acqu@@ ire a guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship get the ex@@ act co@@ -@@ ordin@@ ates of their Gre@@ ens@@ p@@ ace , which makes it possible for example to visit the area .
on the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation &apos;s we@@ b@@ sit@@ e one can see the name information of the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans on the same ma@@ p , where the Gre@@ ens@@ p@@ ace information is .
Le@@ vi@@ ä@@ k@@ an@@ gas thin@@ ks the only risk in his nature con@@ ser@@ vation pur@@ ch@@ ase is if the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation &apos;s operations change from its original idea .
the Hel@@ sin@@ ki F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it found@@ ation established for the purpose of promoting the con@@ ser@@ vation of environment and nature .
the risk is for the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation to act in une@@ th@@ ically or commer@@ ci@@ ally , but it should not be possible .
the basic idea of the Hel@@ sin@@ ki F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation &apos;s H@@ al@@ ti@@ ja project is to protect nature areas in a way they can sta@@ y un@@ spo@@ iled and at peace .
the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation acqu@@ i@@ res land b@@ loc@@ ks either by bu@@ ying or as a don@@ ation .
it finan@@ ces its operation mainly by sell@@ ing Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ ships , but the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation received its initial capital from its foun@@ ders .
the purpose of the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is to acqu@@ ire more protected lands .
it also has plans to go outside F@@ inn@@ ish borders and to bu@@ y some land in Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia .
the Hel@@ sin@@ ki F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation show@@ cases its operations in a po@@ p up for@@ est at Hel@@ sin@@ ki Market S@@ qu@@ are from A@@ ug@@ ust 13 to 19 .
in big c@@ ities , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle th@@ i@@ ev@@ es tor@@ ment Tur@@ k@@ u the most - chec@@ k the situation in your home to@@ wn
from Fin@@ land &apos;s big c@@ ities , Tur@@ k@@ u is the wor@@ st tor@@ men@@ ted .
this year there have been more st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles per cap@@ ita than any of the other n@@ ine big c@@ ities .
based on the b@@ ik@@ e the@@ f@@ ts re@@ ported to the police , Hel@@ sing@@ in S@@ anom@@ at descri@@ b@@ es how many b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles and their parts have been st@@ olen in the ten larg@@ est c@@ ities between January and A@@ ug@@ ust this year per cap@@ ita .
in addition to Tur@@ k@@ u , Hel@@ sin@@ ki , O@@ ul@@ u and La@@ h@@ ti were at the top of the list .
according to the police information , there were four to five b@@ ik@@ e the@@ f@@ ts per a thou@@ s@@ and resid@@ ents .
instead in Es@@ po@@ o and K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a , there were only about two re@@ ported b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts per a thou@@ s@@ and resid@@ ents .
that is a big difference .
&quot; some c@@ ities have double the amount of the@@ f@@ ts per cap@@ ita compared to others , &quot; descri@@ b@@ es C@@ hi@@ ef super@@ inten@@ d@@ ent of the N@@ ational Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard , T@@ om@@ mi R@@ een .
Tur@@ k@@ u police con@@ temp@@ late , why the c@@ ity hol@@ ds the top place in the compar@@ is@@ on .
it is extremely difficult to say , why there have been more b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts in Tur@@ k@@ u than elsewhere .
I have no answer for that .
&quot; one factor for the frequ@@ ency of the@@ f@@ ts can be how much b@@ ik@@ e traffic there is in a c@@ ity , and how many b@@ ik@@ es there are in general , &quot; considers S@@ eni@@ or ser@@ ge@@ ant T@@ e@@ em@@ u Ä@@ ik@@ ä@@ s .
T@@ om@@ mi R@@ een from the N@@ ational Pol@@ ice Bo@@ ard says it could be well expected to see Tur@@ k@@ u , Hel@@ sin@@ ki , and O@@ ul@@ u to rise to the top in the compar@@ is@@ on .
the number of b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle the@@ f@@ ts largely follow those c@@ ities , where people study and where they cy@@ cle .
Tur@@ k@@ u has a comp@@ act centre , short dis@@ tan@@ ces , and pl@@ enty of b@@ ik@@ es available for the th@@ i@@ ev@@ es .
&quot; for example Es@@ po@@ o is a completely different c@@ ity , where c@@ ity cent@@ res are far from each other , and b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle is not necess@@ arily the primary mod@@ e of transport , &quot; R@@ een says .
in the whole of Fin@@ land between January and A@@ ug@@ ust , there have been sli@@ ghtly less b@@ ik@@ e the@@ f@@ ts re@@ ported to the police than during the cor@@ respon@@ ding period last year .
there is still no great reason for jo@@ y .
despite the do@@ w@@ n@@ ward tr@@ end in recent years , there are still a bit over 20@@ ,@@ 000 b@@ ik@@ e the@@ f@@ ts re@@ ported to the police ann@@ u@@ ally .
that means 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 60 b@@ ik@@ es every day , and just in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , about 4@@ 000 b@@ ik@@ es per year .
&quot; these num@@ bers are big , &quot; R@@ een says .
in truth , the th@@ i@@ ev@@ es take even more b@@ ik@@ es , because only a part of the victims report a the@@ ft to the police .
R@@ een encoura@@ ges people to report b@@ ik@@ e the@@ f@@ ts , even if less than one in every ten re@@ ported cases are sol@@ ved .
a typ@@ ical sol@@ ved b@@ ik@@ e the@@ ft is a case , where the police is immediately no@@ ti@@ fied of the the@@ ft , and the th@@ i@@ ef is cau@@ ght right away .
&quot; cases are sol@@ ved also in connection to other investig@@ ation , like for example when in a dru@@ g case there can be st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles found in an a@@ part@@ ment , &quot; R@@ een tell@@ s .
in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , b@@ ik@@ e th@@ i@@ ev@@ es are cau@@ ght every week either re@@ d@@ -@@ han@@ ded or during a police investig@@ ation , says S@@ eni@@ or Con@@ sta@@ ble T@@ im@@ o L@@ ep@@ p@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki .
according to him , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles are st@@ olen for example from a sh@@ opp@@ ing centre b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle stands , from cour@@ ty@@ ards , stor@@ ero@@ oms and b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle b@@ as@@ ements , so practic@@ ally from every@@ where people us@@ u@@ ally stor@@ e them .
as to the individual b@@ ik@@ e mod@@ els , the most st@@ olen is J@@ op@@ o , just like in previous years .
a U@@ -@@ lo@@ ck gives a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle better protection than many other loc@@ ks .
some th@@ i@@ ev@@ es take a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle for example for their own , brief use , but most of the st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles end up for s@@ ale for example on@@ line .
the sta@@ y in the home market .
&quot; at least it has@@ n &apos;@@ t come to the police &apos;s knowledge that st@@ olen b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles har@@ dly go ab@@ road , &quot; R@@ een says .
bu@@ yers of st@@ olen b@@ ik@@ es are normal F@@ inn@@ ish people , according to the police .
some probably bu@@ y a st@@ olen b@@ ik@@ e without know@@ ing .
some may have doub@@ ts about it .
a used b@@ ik@@ e bu@@ yer must be cau@@ ti@@ ous , because they could com@@ mit a conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment off@@ ence or a criminal conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment .
&quot; the al@@ arm b@@ ell@@ s should be r@@ inging , if a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle in good condition is being sol@@ d di@@ r@@ t che@@ a@@ p , &quot; R@@ een says .

he has had five b@@ ik@@ es , but n@@ one have been st@@ olen , says H@@ ir@@ v@@ i . &quot; never have been taken , so in that sense I &apos;@@ ve been really lu@@ ck@@ y . &quot;

those under 15 to account for their crimes ?
Hel@@ sin@@ ki will exper@@ im@@ ent pe@@ er j@@ uri@@ es fam@@ ili@@ ar from the United States
a so@@ -@@ called pe@@ er jur@@ y will exper@@ im@@ ent will begin in Hel@@ sin@@ ki to prevent young people to getting into a vic@@ ious circ@@ le of crime .
at first the exper@@ im@@ ent will be applied to those under 15 , who now are left without criminal responsibility .
a jur@@ y of pe@@ ers will w@@ ei@@ gh in on the first crime a young person comm@@ its .
the idea is that the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers will discuss what happened with the off@@ ender and pres@@ cri@@ be a san@@ c@@ tion .
a week later the off@@ ender can join the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers themselves to make up for what they did .
other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family expla@@ in@@ ing , what has been done and what has been lear@@ n@@ t from it .
Y@@ outh work direc@@ tor T@@ om@@ mi La@@ iti@@ o says it is not a strict model .
we also have other conciliation mod@@ els that are used side by side .
&quot; they all direct a young person &apos;s actions towards a more responsible direction , so that everything would not be ru@@ ined after the first mis@@ take , &quot; says La@@ iti@@ o .
the model for the jur@@ y of pe@@ ers comes from the United States , where it is wid@@ ely used .
the idea is that after their first crime , the young person do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t have to stand in fron@@ t of an ad@@ ult pan@@ el , but can reflect what has happened together with other people of appro@@ xim@@ ately the same age .
the model has been tes@@ ted once .
I@@ l@@ k@@ ka L@@ o@@ vi@@ o , service desig@@ ner from service des@@ ign office Pal@@ m@@ u who has followed the exper@@ im@@ ent says that it was an assa@@ ult that was success@@ fully cle@@ ared up .
before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necess@@ arily been dealt with at all .
&quot; it has been a message to carry on on the p@@ ath you have ch@@ os@@ en , &quot; L@@ o@@ vi@@ o says .
the pe@@ er jur@@ y is part of a project foc@@ using on immigrants in Hel@@ sin@@ ki ( Maa@@ han@@ m@@ uu@@ tta@@ j@@ i@@ en Hel@@ sin@@ ki ) , on the back@@ ground of which are the C@@ ity of Hel@@ sin@@ ki and the W@@ e F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation .
L@@ o@@ vi@@ o emphas@@ ises that these new prac@@ tis@@ es are offer@@ ed to all who need them , not just for young immigrants .
over 70 Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an leaders want the party to stop funding tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign
more than 70 influ@@ ential Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s presid@@ ential campaign .
an American new@@ s@@ paper Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o re@@ ported about the letter , the draft of which it has ob@@ tained .
according to the new@@ s@@ paper , the letter is direc@@ ted to the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an N@@ ational Committee Cha@@ irman Re@@ in@@ ce P@@ ri@@ eb@@ us .
the sig@@ ne@@ es want the party &apos;s money to be put to@@ ward C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al ra@@ ces , instead of tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign .
&quot; we believe that D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s div@@ isi@@ veness , rec@@ kl@@ ess@@ ness , in@@ competence , and rec@@ ord@@ -@@ brea@@ king un@@ pop@@ ul@@ arity risk turning this election into a Democ@@ ratic lan@@ d@@ s@@ l@@ ide , &quot; it says in the letter as re@@ ported by Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o .
only the immediate shi@@ ft of all available R@@ N@@ C resources to v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able S@@ en@@ ate and House ra@@ ces will prevent the G@@ O@@ P from dro@@ w@@ ning with a T@@ ru@@ mp@@ -@@ emb@@ la@@ z@@ on@@ ed an@@ ch@@ or around its nec@@ k .
according to the letter , this should not be a difficult decision , as tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s chan@@ ces of being elected presid@@ ent are e@@ va@@ por@@ ating by the day .
politic@@ o w@@ ri@@ tes that the letter is expected to be sent next week .
politicians G@@ ord@@ on Hu@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y , Ch@@ r@@ is S@@ ha@@ ys , T@@ om C@@ olem@@ an , and V@@ in W@@ e@@ ber are among the sig@@ ne@@ es .
re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an An@@ dre@@ w W@@ e@@ ins@@ te@@ in , a vo@@ cal anti@@ -@@ T@@ r@@ um@@ p Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an , is one of the oper@@ atives organ@@ iz@@ ing the letter .
according to Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o , W@@ e@@ ins@@ te@@ in has said that the letter is coming from &quot; people who want the party to protect its maj@@ orities in the S@@ en@@ ate and the House , &quot; and that it &apos;s not an endor@@ s@@ ement of any@@ body .
the letter tic@@ ks off a series of D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p actions that are believ@@ ed to have ali@@ en@@ ated millions of vo@@ ters .
he is said to also have shown dangerous author@@ ita@@ rian ten@@ d@@ encies .
earlier this week 50 officials working among national security w@@ ro@@ te an open letter to state that they w@@ on &apos;@@ t support D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p as a presid@@ ent .
C@@ lin@@ ton promis@@ es reli@@ ef to U@@ .@@ S@@ . families with children
in the United States , the Democ@@ ratic presid@@ ential candidate H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton shared details of his economic policy on Th@@ urs@@ day evening .
I aim to be the President , so that the U@@ .@@ S@@ . economy would be good for everyone .
&quot; D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p aims to be the President , so that the economy would be good for him and his friends , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton said in her speech .
in the centre of C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s plan is a mas@@ sive f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year , 2@@ 7@@ 5@@ -@@ billion doll@@ ar plan to improve United States &quot; infrastructure , ro@@ ads , br@@ id@@ ges , and air@@ fields .
this would be finan@@ ced partly with tax increas@@ es for the rich , partly with private money .
this building programme is a friend@@ ly g@@ es@@ ture to American workers who suffer@@ ed as fac@@ tor@@ ies were trans@@ fer@@ red to countries with che@@ a@@ p labour .
C@@ lin@@ ton called this programme the greatest investment in w@@ ell@@ -@@ paid jobs since the Sec@@ ond World W@@ ar .
we are a nation of buil@@ ders , we must return to building !
C@@ lin@@ ton said .
on Th@@ urs@@ day , C@@ lin@@ ton also promis@@ ed to e@@ ase the situation of working families with children .
on Th@@ urs@@ day , she s@@ oun@@ ded like S@@ and@@ ers any@@ way as she emphas@@ ised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes .
and if a company lea@@ ves the United States as a tax ex@@ ile , it should pay a lea@@ ving tax , C@@ lin@@ ton said .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys she oppos@@ es the Trans@@ -@@ P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic Par@@ t@@ nership she used to support .
&quot; &#91; as the President , &#93; I will op@@ pose all those trade agreements that work against employees or w@@ ages , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton promis@@ ed .
according to the spec@@ ula@@ tions published by The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost before C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s speech , C@@ lin@@ ton was going to critic@@ ise the economic pla@@ t@@ form by Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p published on Mon@@ day about it &quot; only fav@@ ours mill@@ i@@ on@@ ai@@ res like him . &quot;
C@@ lin@@ ton has pre@@ viously called tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s sugges@@ tion of a wha@@ cking tax cut to cor@@ por@@ ation taxes &quot; his lo@@ op@@ h@@ ole . &quot;
on Th@@ urs@@ day , C@@ lin@@ ton emphas@@ ised that she her@@ self is a d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter of a small ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur .
she remin@@ ded the lis@@ ten@@ ers about small ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ s , whose invo@@ ices tr@@ um@@ p has left un@@ paid , and about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , tr@@ um@@ p him@@ self f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ates in China and M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
&quot; if he wants to make America great again , he should start by manufac@@ turing products in America him@@ self , &quot; C@@ lin@@ ton mo@@ c@@ ked .
this is what Ri@@ o &apos;s rat@@ ings look like : appar@@ ently the competition has@@ n &apos;@@ t managed to g@@ lu@@ e F@@ inn@@ s to their s@@ cre@@ ens , but the mo@@ b@@ ile application is interesting
us@@ u@@ ally s@@ porting events are shown as shar@@ p pe@@ a@@ ks in television rat@@ ings .
so far , the Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ am@@ es ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t reached huge vie@@ wer rat@@ ings .
at a time the g@@ am@@ es have g@@ lu@@ ed 12 per cent of the population to their s@@ cre@@ ens at its best : s@@ w@@ im@@ ming on Y@@ le &apos;s Ol@@ ymp@@ ic chan@@ nel , T@@ V@@ 2 , on Tu@@ es@@ day night was followed by 6@@ 15@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers .
for the sa@@ ke of compar@@ is@@ on : the European A@@ th@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships a month ago got almost 8@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers at a time , and U@@ E@@ F@@ A European Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships &quot; number was well over a million .
so far , the most interesting Ol@@ ymp@@ ic s@@ ports have been cy@@ cl@@ ing on S@@ und@@ ay evening and ar@@ tis@@ tic g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics that open@@ ed the fif@@ th ga@@ me day . both of these reached almost half a million vie@@ w@@ ers at a time on the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic chan@@ nel .
the head of Y@@ le S@@ port , P@@ an@@ u Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen , is satisfied with the rat@@ ings and no@@ tes that for the first time ever , the vie@@ w@@ ers are divid@@ ed between several different dev@@ ices .
in addition to television , F@@ inn@@ s follow the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics from Ri@@ o A@@ re@@ ena .
we are satisfied with how many T@@ V vie@@ w@@ ers choose the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics in the first place .
even on the television side , the vie@@ w@@ ers are divid@@ ed between T@@ V@@ 2 and Y@@ le F@@ e@@ m ch@@ ann@@ els .
Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics is the first s@@ porting event Y@@ le has d@@ ed@@ icated a whole chan@@ nel to .
when there is broad@@ c@@ ast 24 hours a day , and there are 20@@ ,@@ 000 to 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers all the time , it &apos;s a good basis .
the vie@@ wer rat@@ ings are lower than in L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 or B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing 200@@ 8 , but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the Ri@@ o g@@ am@@ es are broad@@ c@@ ast in Fin@@ land during the night time .
another reason for the ta@@ me interest - if some@@ one thin@@ ks it &apos;s ta@@ me - surely is the traditional F@@ inn@@ ish reason : if Fin@@ land had w@@ on a surpris@@ ing med@@ al early on , the interest would &apos;@@ ve surely ju@@ mp@@ ed with it .
in addition , the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics is only just beginning , as well as other s@@ ports that interest F@@ inn@@ s : sa@@ il@@ ing and rid@@ ing .
according to Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen , the rat@@ ings of the beginning were close to what was expected .
when the a@@ th@@ le@@ tics begin , the rat@@ ings explo@@ de .
Y@@ le laun@@ ched a Y@@ le Ri@@ o 20@@ 16 mo@@ b@@ ile application for the g@@ am@@ es , and during the first ga@@ me days it bec@@ a@@ me app@@ le A@@ P@@ P stor@@ e &apos;s most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed free application in Fin@@ land .
by Mon@@ day , the application had been do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 15@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 times .
I gu@@ ess that now we &apos;@@ re some@@ where around 200@@ ,@@ 000 do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ads .
&quot; we will get the on@@ line rat@@ ings only later , &quot; says Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen .
Ri@@ o A@@ re@@ ena has not worked as des@@ ired with all the users .
Po@@ k@@ k@@ inen says they &apos;@@ ve had fe@@ ed@@ back and have managed to fi@@ x the bu@@ gs .
the use of Ri@@ o A@@ re@@ ena has included time la@@ g and other small , technical issues in the beginning .
there are now up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sions of the appl@@ ications that should fi@@ x these bu@@ gs .
Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics have a wid@@ er cover@@ age on Y@@ le &apos;s ch@@ ann@@ els and in A@@ re@@ ena than any other s@@ porting event ever before .
some s@@ ports can be followed on Y@@ le F@@ e@@ m chan@@ nel , and in Y@@ le P@@ u@@ he in radi@@ o broad@@ cas@@ ts the g@@ am@@ es daily .
in addition for the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics being possible the most lab@@ or@@ ious ever for Y@@ le , they are also the last one that can be followed only from Y@@ le ch@@ ann@@ els .
from the year 20@@ 18 on@@ wards Ol@@ ymp@@ ic s@@ ports can be seen both on Y@@ le and on commercial ch@@ ann@@ els .
how de@@ ep is Fin@@ land &apos;s deep@@ est la@@ ke ?
according to official statistics , the deep@@ est la@@ ke in Fin@@ land is P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne , it &apos;s de@@ p@@ th being 9@@ 5@@ ,@@ 3 met@@ res at R@@ is@@ tin@@ sel@@ k@@ ä .
it might be even deep@@ er .
tech@@ ni@@ que di@@ ving ins@@ truc@@ tor M@@ at@@ ti K@@ ann@@ el@@ a found a h@@ oll@@ ow sized appro@@ xim@@ ately 20 s@@ qu@@ are met@@ res from R@@ is@@ tis@@ el@@ k@@ ä , and the di@@ ving com@@ pu@@ ter show@@ ed its b@@ ot@@ tom de@@ p@@ th to be 10@@ 4 met@@ res .
in sum@@ mer 20@@ 14 , F@@ inn@@ ish Environment In@@ stitu@@ te attemp@@ ted to confirm the finding using ec@@ ho@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding , but it was in vain .
the method does not necess@@ arily find a small h@@ oll@@ ow from a hund@@ red met@@ res , says development eng@@ ine@@ er J@@ ar@@ i Ha@@ k@@ al@@ a .
so for now the official de@@ p@@ th is still 9@@ 5@@ ,@@ 3 met@@ res .
other de@@ ep la@@ kes include In@@ ar@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i ( 9@@ 2 met@@ res ) and Su@@ vas@@ ves@@ i ( 90 met@@ res ) .
S@@ aim@@ a@@ a , T@@ o@@ is@@ ves@@ i , and P@@ ä@@ ä@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i reach over 80 met@@ res .
they have not been stu@@ di@@ ed as much as P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne .
especially In@@ ar@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i &apos;s b@@ ot@@ tom has not been carefully ma@@ pped .
&quot; there might well be some un@@ known de@@ p@@ ths , &quot; K@@ ann@@ el@@ a pon@@ ders .
if the deep@@ est la@@ ke is defined by its average de@@ p@@ th , it would be S@@ uu@@ ri Ju@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i , 23 met@@ res .
this way examin@@ ed , P@@ ä@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ nne is not among the top ten of the deep@@ est , and Su@@ vas@@ ves@@ i is even f@@ ar@@ ther from the top .
ed@@ ited 12 A@@ ug@@ ust 2@@ .@@ 29 p@@ m : final paragraph ed@@ ited , because the deep@@ est la@@ kes by their average de@@ p@@ th were wrong .
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen concerning tax reduc@@ tions : pen@@ sioners &quot; taxation still har@@ der
pen@@ sioners &quot; taxation is still ti@@ gh@@ ter than the w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen says this dis@@ advantage emer@@ ged just before the general election , and it was promis@@ ed the pen@@ sioners &quot; taxation would be made more equal compared to the w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners .
there is nothing like this in the Government &apos;s proposal .
we think it should defin@@ i@@ tely be there .
given promis@@ es should be kept after the election , he says to L@@ ä@@ nn@@ en Med@@ ia .
in the beginning of this year , w@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ ear@@ ners got income tax d@@ educ@@ tions that reduc@@ es the taxation .
the issue he@@ ated up the members of the opposition , who g@@ ri@@ ll@@ ed the then Minister of Fin@@ ance , A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der S@@ tu@@ b@@ b ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) , about the election promis@@ es .
pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power secu@@ red , will not gro@@ w
according to I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen , the tax d@@ educ@@ tions in the definition of policy presented by the Minister of Fin@@ ance , P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ po ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) , are more about sec@@ uring pur@@ ch@@ ase power than increasing it , because w@@ ages will not be raised next year .
he says the tax d@@ educ@@ tion has a positive impact on pur@@ ch@@ ase power and employment , if there are no other things that add to people &apos;s un@@ certainty .
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen is pleased with the Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä &apos;s ( C@@ entr@@ e ) and Or@@ po &apos;s messa@@ ges about the will to respect the har@@ d@@ -@@ w@@ on competitiveness p@@ act .
he says ad@@ her@@ ing to the p@@ act is important credi@@ bil@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ wise .
it is the most important action in both economic and employment policies .
it is done join@@ tly with the labour market organisations , so it should not be spo@@ iled by challeng@@ ing it .
it is necessary , because the economy reli@@ es so much on the domestic demand and on people &apos;s own optimis@@ m about the future .
pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ed unemployment must be discussed in the government budget session
I@@ hal@@ a@@ inen appe@@ als to the Government to discuss l@@ ong@@ -@@ term unemployment in its budget session , at least to stop its increase .
in June , there were 17@@ ,@@ 000 more l@@ ong@@ -@@ term un@@ employed people than a year before .
he says that if this growth will not stop , the Government &apos;s goal of increasing the employment rate to 7@@ 2 per cent will be lost .
he war@@ ns that if the challenge posed by pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ed unemployment is over@@ lo@@ ok@@ ed , it will mean a very large soci@@ e@@ tal b@@ ill .
Am@@ b@@ assa@@ d@@ or : no known F@@ inn@@ ish victims in the T@@ ha@@ il@@ and attacks
the bom@@ b attacks in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and that happened during last evening and night ( C@@ E@@ T ) kill@@ ed at least four people .
the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y advis@@ es all the F@@ inn@@ ish people in the country to be w@@ at@@ ch@@ ful and to avoid the bu@@ si@@ est tou@@ ris@@ t areas , and to follow the authorities &quot; direc@@ tions .
those F@@ inn@@ ish tou@@ ris@@ ts that are planning to travel to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and should not canc@@ el their jour@@ ne@@ y because of the explo@@ sions , but they should follow the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y &apos;s advice about cau@@ tion , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
very few F@@ inn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and
according to W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en , currently there are very few F@@ inn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , although their ex@@ act num@@ bers are difficult to estima@@ te .
F@@ inn@@ s &quot; tra@@ v@@ elling se@@ as@@ on to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and takes place around turn of the year .
most tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and this time of year come from S@@ ou@@ thern Europe and China .
after the bom@@ b attacks , the F@@ inn@@ ish E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y has got some comments via F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok from F@@ inn@@ s in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y has attemp@@ ted to contact especially those F@@ inn@@ s that are in H@@ ua H@@ in , in order to get information about the to@@ wn &apos;s situation .
however , several of our contac@@ ts in H@@ ua H@@ in are currently out of to@@ wn .
generally speaking everything seems to be fine , W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en says .
no information about the responsible party
according to W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en , there is no information about who is responsible for the attack .
the amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or thin@@ ks the inc@@ idents may be connec@@ ted to the political un@@ rest in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s dis@@ uni@@ ted society , and to the referendum last week about the constitution drawn up by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
the law passed in the referendum .
the referendum was not an open , democratic process .
in the country people got for example ar@@ res@@ ted , when they had declar@@ ed that they op@@ pose the law .
as for the S@@ ou@@ thern prov@@ inc@@ es in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , there sm@@ ou@@ l@@ ders an eth@@ n@@ ic@@ -@@ ra@@ cial conflict related to the Mus@@ li@@ m population , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
the Mus@@ lim@@ s want to increase their autonom@@ y .
however , there has not been any earlier attacks to tou@@ ris@@ t at@@ trac@@ tions .
there was a big , local f@@ esti@@ val day in B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k today , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
according to her , the c@@ ity is cel@@ eb@@ ra@@ ting the Qu@@ een &apos;s b@@ ir@@ th@@ day and mo@@ th@@ ers &quot; D@@ ay .
there is@@ n &apos;@@ t a lot of traffic in the c@@ ity .
the attack most likely have such an effect on the daily rou@@ tin@@ es that the authorities will be very strict about security .
T@@ ha@@ il@@ and police : the attacks are not international terrorism
according to the police , the attacks are &quot; local sa@@ bo@@ ta@@ ge &quot; and di@@ ffer from custom@@ ary terrorist attacks .
also Isla@@ mic terrorism has been r@@ ul@@ ed out , T@@ ha@@ il@@ and police report according to the ne@@ ws agency A@@ P .
at least four people have di@@ ed in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and during 24 hours , as 11 bom@@ bs have explo@@ ded around the country , like for example in tou@@ ris@@ t fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes P@@ hu@@ ket and H@@ ua H@@ in .
there were four bom@@ bs that explo@@ ded in a tou@@ ris@@ t at@@ trac@@ tion also fav@@ ou@@ red by the F@@ inn@@ s , on hol@@ id@@ ay is@@ land P@@ hu@@ ket , reports T@@ ha@@ i new@@ s@@ paper B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k P@@ ost .
according to current information , they did not claim any lives .
the paper says two of the bom@@ bs explo@@ ded on Pat@@ ong B@@ each .
in addition , two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded in P@@ han@@ g N@@ g@@ a , where one person was w@@ oun@@ ded , according to the paper .
in a pop@@ ular tou@@ ris@@ t at@@ trac@@ tion , H@@ ua H@@ in , the local authorities report that a total of four bom@@ bs has explo@@ ded yesterday and today .
both double bom@@ b@@ ings kill@@ ed at least one .
furthermore , at least one bom@@ b explo@@ ded in both the vill@@ age of S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i and the c@@ ity of T@@ ran@@ g in S@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
both bom@@ b@@ ings kill@@ ed at least one .
also S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i is fam@@ ili@@ ar to many a tra@@ v@@ ell@@ er , since the way to K@@ o Sa@@ mu@@ i , K@@ o P@@ ha N@@ g@@ an , and K@@ o T@@ A@@ O hol@@ id@@ ay is@@ lands goes through it .
the quar@@ ter responsible for the attacks is not known
according to P@@ ra@@ y@@ ut C@@ han@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ Ch@@ a , head of the military j@@ un@@ ta r@@ ul@@ ing T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , the quar@@ ter responsible for the attacks is so far not known .
the bom@@ bs are an attempt to create cha@@ os and con@@ fu@@ sion .
we should not sti@@ r up any more pan@@ ic in the people , he said to the jour@@ n@@ alists .
according to Gen@@ . P@@ ra@@ w@@ it W@@ ong@@ su@@ w@@ an , D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty Prime Minister in charge of security , at least the H@@ ua H@@ in and T@@ ran@@ g attacks are linked .
he said to T@@ ha@@ i B@@ S@@ B that the off@@ end@@ ers &quot; purpose has been to destro@@ y the tourism in the country , since all the attacks happened in tou@@ ris@@ t at@@ trac@@ tions .
the F@@ inn@@ ish E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y advis@@ es all the F@@ inn@@ ish people in the country to be w@@ at@@ ch@@ ful and to avoid the bu@@ si@@ est tou@@ ris@@ t areas , and to follow the authorities &quot; direc@@ tions .
those F@@ inn@@ s that are planning to travel to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and should not canc@@ el their jour@@ ne@@ y because of the explo@@ sions , but they should follow the E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y &apos;s advice about cau@@ tion , says W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ en .
Europeans among the w@@ oun@@ ded
so far , there is very little information about the attacks that happened during the F@@ inn@@ ish night time or their victims .
a little more information has been received from the yesterday evening &apos;s attack in H@@ ua H@@ in .
a local w@@ oman di@@ ed and over 20 others were in@@ ju@@ red in it , and among the w@@ oun@@ ded there were at least n@@ ine foreign tou@@ ris@@ ts .
there are at least German , Italian , D@@ ut@@ ch , and Austri@@ an people among the w@@ oun@@ ded .
at least three people were w@@ oun@@ ded in the second H@@ ua H@@ in attack .
two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded ne@@ ar a c@@ lo@@ ck to@@ wer known as an at@@ trac@@ tion .
T@@ ha@@ i P@@ B@@ S reports that the police have ro@@ p@@ ed of the H@@ ua H@@ in area they believe to have found yet another bom@@ b .
according to the prov@@ in@@ ce govern@@ or , the S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i bom@@ b was hid@@ den in a flo@@ w@@ er@@ bed .
one mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity employe@@ e di@@ ed in the attack .
at least one was w@@ oun@@ ded .
the ch@@ i@@ ef of police said in the C@@ N@@ N inter@@ view that there were two bom@@ bs used also in the S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i attack , and that they w@@ ent off about at about half an h@@ our inter@@ val .
according to the B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k P@@ ost , the bom@@ bs explo@@ ded in fron@@ t of two different police sta@@ tions .
B@@ il@@ es from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . w@@ on the women &apos;s all@@ -@@ around
A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra R@@ ais@@ man from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . was the second with a sc@@ or@@ e of 6@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 9@@ 8 , and Russia &apos;s A@@ li@@ ja M@@ usta@@ fin@@ a was the third with her sc@@ or@@ e of 5@@ 8@@ .@@ 6@@ 65 points .
B@@ il@@ es , 18 , is still s@@ tri@@ ving for g@@ old in floor , va@@ ult , and balance be@@ am in the Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics .

E@@ S@@ A H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , who run@@ s a real es@@ ta@@ te agency and a children &apos;s play c@@ lu@@ b in the same pre@@ mis@@ es in P@@ hu@@ ket , is not wor@@ ried about the effect the T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s bom@@ b attacks have on tourism .
if there are no more attacks , I believe nothing much will follow from this , estima@@ tes H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , a F@@ inn@@ ish ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur who has worked in A@@ sia about two dec@@ ad@@ es .
the experienc@@ ed ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur has seen many traged@@ ies in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and close up .
there is always something here .
first a t@@ su@@ na@@ mi , then the b@@ ir@@ d f@@ l@@ u , and last year a bom@@ b attack in B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k .

H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a heard about the attack from his own employe@@ e .
the employe@@ e called him about n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck local time and said he should not come to the office .
H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a says that both the pro@@ men@@ ade and the main stre@@ et , B@@ ang@@ l@@ a Ro@@ ad , were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks .
many of my local employees came to the work@@ place as us@@ ual in the morning .
they thought the road b@@ loc@@ ks were set up because of the Qu@@ een &apos;s b@@ ir@@ th@@ day , H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a says referring to F@@ rid@@ ay &apos;s hol@@ id@@ ay in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
at Pat@@ ong , the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here was cal@@ m , and the businesses on the main stre@@ et were allowed to open at around 10 local time .
at the be@@ ach , many of the people ha@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even heard about the attacks .
around 2@@ .30 in the afternoon T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s time , the traffic at Pat@@ ong had re@@ turned to normal , and most of the sh@@ op@@ s had open@@ ed their do@@ ors .
based on the attack place , the explo@@ sion was rela@@ tively small , says H@@ u@@ o@@ vil@@ a , who w@@ ent to see the attack place .
later the c@@ ar in question was sp@@ ot@@ ted in J@@ ou@@ x@@ hol@@ min@@ ti@@ e , K@@ r@@ uu@@ n@@ up@@ y@@ y .
when the police reached the place , the c@@ ar was set on fir@@ e .
the pat@@ ro@@ l saw two men that f@@ it the descri@@ p@@ tions hid@@ ing in a ne@@ ar@@ by s@@ pr@@ u@@ ce c@@ op@@ se .
one of the men was immediately cau@@ ght .

Direc@@ tor of Research about changes in Russian lead@@ ership : clearly a move asi@@ de
on F@@ rid@@ ay Russia had its most hi@@ gh@@ -@@ ran@@ king lead@@ ership change in years , as President V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir P@@ u@@ tin remo@@ ved his C@@ hi@@ ef of Sta@@ ff Ser@@ g@@ ei I@@ van@@ o@@ v .
I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s success@@ or is a 4@@ 4@@ -@@ year old An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o of Es@@ ton@@ ian back@@ ground .
he is an ex@@ -@@ diplom@@ at and has been I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ty .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o says that a reason behind I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al can be P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s will to prevent strong people around him of ga@@ ther@@ ing too much power .
he ad@@ ds that ro@@ ta@@ ting lead@@ ership tasks is one way of using power .
this is a way to prevent people from increasing their power independent of the President .
according to K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o , it is also possible that I@@ van@@ o@@ v has been in tro@@ u@@ ble with other leaders or that he has b@@ l@@ under@@ ed .
a dro@@ p in status for I@@ van@@ o@@ v
I@@ van@@ o@@ v , who has been part of P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s inn@@ er circ@@ le , is now trans@@ fer@@ ring to be the ec@@ ology and transport special representative .
on a ta@@ pe presented by the state media P@@ u@@ tin said the change was a mutual decision .
P@@ u@@ tin said that I@@ van@@ o@@ v him@@ self had requested a transfer to another role , and had proposed V@@ ain@@ o as a candidate for his position , re@@ ported Russia T@@ od@@ ay .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o says that from I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s point of view , this is a clear dro@@ p in status .
ec@@ ological or transport matters do not have a very high priority in Russia .
he points out that I@@ van@@ o@@ v has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power .
in addition , I@@ van@@ o@@ v has had a significant role in the presid@@ ent &apos;s Security Council .
during So@@ vi@@ et times , I@@ van@@ o@@ v worked at K@@ G@@ B together with P@@ u@@ tin .
he was considered as P@@ u@@ tin &apos;s possible success@@ or in 200@@ 8 , but D@@ mit@@ ri Med@@ ved@@ e@@ v bec@@ a@@ me the presid@@ ent .
K@@ ang@@ as@@ pur@@ o points out that the old gu@@ ard , for example the govern@@ ors , has been recently re@@ placed in Russia .
sen@@ i@@ or Research fellow K@@ at@@ ri P@@ y@@ nn@@ ö@@ ni@@ em@@ i from the F@@ inn@@ ish In@@ stitu@@ te of International Affairs says that the fact that P@@ u@@ tin is re@@ pla@@ cing his inn@@ er circ@@ le with youn@@ ger people is more interesting than who is I@@ van@@ o@@ v &apos;s success@@ or .

the S@@ y@@ rian O@@ b@@ serva@@ tory for Human Rights said the civil@@ ians were placed in hund@@ re@@ ds of c@@ ars , where they were taken to J@@ ar@@ ab@@ u@@ lu@@ s .
the Ara@@ b and K@@ ur@@ d fi@@ gh@@ ters managed to se@@ iz@@ e 90 per cent of the Man@@ bi@@ j to@@ wn that was important for I@@ S@@ I@@ S .

the Minis@@ try of the I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or &apos;s definition of document access policy is un@@ law@@ ful , says prof@@ ess@@ or of public law , T@@ om@@ i V@@ ou@@ tila@@ inen , from the Uni@@ versity of E@@ as@@ tern Fin@@ land .
V@@ ou@@ tila@@ inen says to S@@ T@@ T that document access cannot be based on an official &apos;s own policies , but it is based on law .
earlier the Minis@@ try of the I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or ref@@ used to sur@@ r@@ ender the partici@@ pan@@ t list of the Minister of I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or &apos;s events to I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at .
the Minister justified his decision with the ins@@ truc@@ tions by the Prime Minister &apos;s Office and with the fact that the information was ente@@ red in the Minister &apos;s cal@@ end@@ ar , not in the accoun@@ ting material .
the C@@ hi@@ ef Commun@@ ications O@@ ffic@@ er of the Minis@@ try says to S@@ T@@ T that the need of re@@ form@@ ing the practices has been remar@@ ked in the Minis@@ try .

early in the se@@ as@@ on , he h@@ ur@@ t his back th@@ i@@ gh , and had to pass Ol@@ ymp@@ ic quali@@ fications in J@@ a@@ ma@@ ic@@ a .
it has not been the perfec@@ t buil@@ d@@ -@@ up but I am in much better sha@@ pe
I &apos;@@ ve been training well , and that &apos;s the key thing , b@@ ol@@ t said in his press conference in Ri@@ o .
that press conference included s@@ can@@ ti@@ ly cla@@ d S@@ amb@@ a d@@ an@@ c@@ ers and re@@ por@@ ters that had turned into f@@ ans .
the mur@@ mur@@ ing around b@@ ol@@ t under@@ lines that fact that the sta@@ r of the J@@ a@@ ma@@ ic@@ an has r@@ isen during the age when a@@ th@@ le@@ tics has str@@ u@@ gg@@ led with d@@ op@@ ing s@@ cand@@ als and s@@ l@@ id@@ ing interest .

back then b@@ ol@@ t , aged 17 , was a young promis@@ e s@@ low@@ ed down by in@@ j@@ uri@@ es and la@@ x attitude towards prac@@ tis@@ ing .

this is har@@ der
a year later in the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship in Berl@@ in , b@@ ol@@ t reached the cul@@ min@@ ation of his care@@ er when measu@@ red with time .
the world rec@@ or@@ ds from Berl@@ in , 9@@ ,@@ 5@@ 8 for hund@@ red met@@ res and 19@@ ,@@ 19 for two hund@@ red , are still val@@ id .
b@@ ol@@ t has announced that in Ri@@ o his goals are the world record for 200 met@@ res and going under 19 secon@@ ds , but no one believes this bes@@ id@@ es b@@ ol@@ t him@@ self .

during his re@@ ign that beg@@ an in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , b@@ ol@@ t has not lost once in an el@@ ite competition fin@@ als , if only he has managed to start .
in D@@ a@@ eg@@ u 20@@ 11 , b@@ ol@@ t did not run in the 1@@ 00@@ m W@@ C fin@@ als because of a fal@@ se start .
in bit over a week , b@@ ol@@ t will be 30 .
he is an old man in young men &apos;s sport , and Ri@@ o g@@ am@@ es are his final Ol@@ ymp@@ ics .
b@@ ol@@ t has set the final fin@@ ish line for his care@@ er to be next year &apos;s W@@ C g@@ am@@ es in L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
these are the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics that separate me from the pac@@ k .

7 cu@@ ri@@ ous things that , according to science , pro@@ long your life
science has stu@@ di@@ ed everything possible between the he@@ av@@ en and the ear@@ th .
these things have been prov@@ en to bring ex@@ tra years to a person &apos;s life .
some of these thing are ha@@ b@@ its that , either directly or in@@ directly , will affect a person &apos;s health in a way that pro@@ l@@ ong@@ s their life .
sometimes the things a person can &apos;@@ t influence themselves can bring them ex@@ tra years .
these are for example ten@@ d@@ ency towards ab@@ domin@@ al ob@@ es@@ ity or social status .
going sh@@ opp@@ ing reg@@ ularly can pro@@ long your life .
it &apos;s not always even necessary to spen@@ d - just pic@@ king up a car@@ ton of mil@@ k is enough .
there are many studies that have aimed at dis@@ cover@@ ing the secre@@ t behind long age .
med@@ ical D@@ a@@ ily presented s@@ even of the most pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar research results .
according to science , all of these things may bring you more years for your life .
d@@ rin@@ king be@@ er and co@@ ff@@ ee
d@@ rin@@ king co@@ ff@@ ee has been shown to provide a protec@@ tive effect against certain canc@@ ers , type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , as well as Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and Par@@ k@@ ins@@ on &apos;s disease .
according to the study by Har@@ var@@ d Uni@@ versity , moder@@ ate co@@ ff@@ ee consumption was linked to a &quot; lower risk of death , &quot; especially from heart and ne@@ uro@@ log@@ ical diseases .
as for al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , there are studies that say d@@ rin@@ king a moder@@ ate amount of one to three d@@ rin@@ ks a day may pro@@ long your life .
for example , one study found w@@ ine d@@ rin@@ kers were more likely to out@@ live those who did not d@@ rin@@ k at all .
regula@@ r f@@ los@@ sing can possibly add more than six years to a person &apos;s life , according to a research .
the claim is based on the fact this preven@@ ts inf@@ la@@ med gu@@ ms .
these in turn can lead to increase in the risk of developing other diseases throughout the body .
a study conduc@@ ted in Nor@@ way found out how lau@@ gh@@ ing affec@@ ts your lif@@ es@@ p@@ an .
a s@@ even@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ project trac@@ ked over 5@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 people .
those who lau@@ gh@@ ed more were 35 per cent more likely to still be ali@@ ve at the end of the study .
se@@ x , when the protection against S@@ T@@ D@@ s is taken into consideration , is good for your health according to many studies .
in addition , it can also add years to your life .
unfortunately , just having se@@ x as it is , is not enough .
in order for a person to gain ex@@ tra years to their life , they also need to cl@@ im@@ a@@ x .
being p@@ hy@@ si@@ cally active sure br@@ ings ex@@ tra years , there &apos;s no den@@ ying that .
however , long life do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t necess@@ arily require absolu@@ te le@@ ann@@ ess .
a study from O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity found out that women with a b@@ ig@@ ger bac@@ k@@ si@@ de ten@@ ded to have lower levels of ch@@ oles@@ te@@ ro@@ l .
they also had higher levels of om@@ eg@@ a@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id@@ s in their system .
the same study connec@@ ted these things to an overall lower risk of mor@@ tal@@ ity .
whether it &apos;s a person who ear@@ ned a med@@ al in the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics or an ac@@ tor who w@@ on an O@@ sc@@ ar , they are more likely to live longer than your average man .
many studies have attemp@@ ted to find a reason for the phen@@ omen@@ on .
one explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that br@@ ings ex@@ tra years to their life .
some res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers spec@@ ula@@ te that long life is caused by the person &apos;s social status - which for its part enab@@ les the pursu@@ it of acc@@ ol@@ ad@@ es such as the N@@ o@@ be@@ l pri@@ z@@ e .
a study of sh@@ opp@@ ing behaviour of people ages 65 and ol@@ der found that a person who goes sh@@ opp@@ ing every day is more likely to live longer than some@@ one who sh@@ op@@ s less .
this is because going to a concrete sho@@ p reduc@@ es l@@ on@@ elin@@ ess .
that , on its turn , has been shown to tri@@ gg@@ er bi@@ ological changes that may lead to an early death .
so put down that cre@@ dit c@@ ard - on@@ line sh@@ opp@@ ing does not have the same effect .

unfortunately there are shor@@ ta@@ ges in our b@@ ul@@ k s@@ we@@ et selec@@ tion , because P@@ os@@ ti deli@@ ver@@ ed our order to Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki !
we &apos;@@ l@@ l get more when P@@ os@@ ti manag@@ es to del@@ iv@@ er it !
unless they &apos;@@ re bus@@ y c@@ ut@@ ting g@@ ras@@ s , it said in the sign .
the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er &apos;s j@@ es@@ ting sign has to do with F@@ inn@@ ish P@@ os@@ ti last s@@ pr@@ ing extended their services to cover also g@@ ras@@ s c@@ ut@@ ting .
P@@ os@@ ti off@@ ers g@@ ras@@ s c@@ ut@@ ting until the end of A@@ ug@@ ust .
H@@ al@@ tia thought the sign was m@@ os@@ tly am@@ using , and decided to share it on the social media .
I was f@@ lab@@ ber@@ g@@ as@@ ted by the pop@@ ul@@ arity of the post .
the media representatives have been calling me all the time , and the attention at@@ trac@@ ted by this thing is a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing , H@@ al@@ tia mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ed .
on F@@ rid@@ ay night H@@ al@@ tia &apos;s post had already over 7@@ 00 shar@@ es at F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok .

the back@@ ground for this is that three of five p@@ all@@ ets lost their way and en@@ ded up in a wrong place ( Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki ) , and we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t do a parti@@ al deli@@ very ( to S@@ al@@ o ) at three o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck , but deli@@ ver@@ ed the five p@@ all@@ ets only today , K@@ aid@@ es@@ o@@ ja said to I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at .

T@@ ei@@ ja H@@ al@@ tia was not ir@@ ri@@ ta@@ ted about the sign , because she was able to find all hear b@@ ul@@ k s@@ we@@ et fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes from the selec@@ tion .

the wish of the family of the w@@ oman mur@@ der@@ ed in L@@ o@@ vi@@ isa : all the possible don@@ ations for police do@@ gs
the family of the 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year old w@@ oman mur@@ der@@ ed a week ago in L@@ o@@ vi@@ isa wish that instead of flo@@ w@@ ers and prin@@ ted forms of cond@@ ol@@ ences , people would make a don@@ ation for police do@@ g work .

the post says the victi@@ m had worked as a tem@@ p at the V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ary c@@ lin@@ ic of S@@ i@@ po@@ o , and that she had also worked there for her n@@ ur@@ se training .
the c@@ lin@@ ic re@@ members the w@@ oman with tou@@ ching words .

a good fri@@ end .
we still can &apos;@@ t fully comprehen@@ d that she &apos;s gone .
the F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok post contains an account number where the don@@ ations can be trans@@ fer@@ red .
the status up@@ date men@@ tions that all the don@@ ated money goes entirely to police do@@ gs , mainly for pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing body arm@@ our ves@@ ts .

she had several animals , among others a hor@@ se , do@@ gs , c@@ ats , ch@@ ic@@ ken , and a co@@ ck .
the 2@@ 7@@ -@@ year old man sus@@ pec@@ ted for the mur@@ der did not know the w@@ oman , and they had no connection to one another .
a police do@@ g B@@ ö@@ r@@ j@@ e was involved in the trac@@ king of the mur@@ der@@ er , and the do@@ g was seriously in@@ ju@@ red during the making of the ar@@ rest .

a D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court sen@@ ten@@ ced P@@ os@@ ti for commit@@ ting a b@@ reach of the An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ is@@ crimin@@ ation Ac@@ t

the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court en@@ join@@ ed P@@ os@@ ti to pay the employe@@ e most of the re@@ tained w@@ ages and 2000 euro@@ s as compensation for discrimination .
according to the sen@@ tence , P@@ os@@ ti could have re@@ tained just that part of the initi@@ a@@ tor &apos;s w@@ ages that was equal to the initi@@ ation part of the whole day &apos;s work .
the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court said the employe@@ e had been , against the An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ is@@ crimin@@ ation Ac@@ t , placed in an un@@ fav@@ ourable position based on their trade union@@ ism .
the employe@@ e had followed the F@@ inn@@ ish P@@ ost and log@@ is@@ tics Union Pa@@ u &apos;s union decision about work@@ place initi@@ ation ban .

the Eng@@ lis@@ h F@@ o@@ ot@@ b@@ all As@@ soci@@ ation F@@ A is keeping him from the ga@@ me , because P@@ og@@ b@@ a got a sus@@ pension in Ju@@ ven@@ tus .

at F@@ low , me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ an@@ ia is a vir@@ tu@@ e
the precise criteria of enjo@@ yment and ambitious v@@ isions have established the status of F@@ low F@@ esti@@ val as an inter@@ nation@@ ally respected event star@@ red by the top ar@@ tis@@ ts in the world .
flo@@ w F@@ esti@@ val beg@@ ins on F@@ rid@@ ay in Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
the f@@ esti@@ val gu@@ es@@ ts have typ@@ ically expressed themselves with individual d@@ res@@ sing .
one of the main stage ar@@ tis@@ ts this year is the pun@@ k leg@@ end I@@ g@@ gy P@@ o@@ p .
the F@@ low F@@ esti@@ val event area is sty@@ led with for example arti@@ fic@@ ial tur@@ f and ar@@ t ins@@ tall@@ ations .
for us , it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a be@@ er tent , says the ar@@ tis@@ tic Direc@@ tor of the event , Tu@@ om@@ as K@@ all@@ io .
flo@@ w F@@ esti@@ val , organised in Su@@ vi@@ la@@ h@@ ti , Hel@@ sin@@ ki , this wee@@ ken@@ d , has gro@@ wn from a small blo@@ ck f@@ esti@@ val to an event with ten@@ s of thousands vis@@ itors .
behind the success , there is a simple question : what kind of an event would the organis@@ ers themselves want to atten@@ d ?
thinking this way is quite excep@@ tional in event production .
most of the time the goal is to reach the level of necess@@ ity and to act according to the authorities &quot; orders , says ar@@ tis@@ tic Direc@@ tor Tu@@ om@@ as K@@ all@@ io .
a week before the event he k@@ new , that F@@ low will sel@@ l out also this year .
the goal has been to increase the last year &apos;s number of vis@@ itors , 7@@ 0.@@ 000 , by 5@@ .@@ 000 people .
there will be a group of interesting domestic and foreign ar@@ tis@@ ts at the f@@ esti@@ val also this year .
the growth of the vis@@ itor number is a good thing , because the operations have to fund@@ ed some@@ way .
on the other hand , we d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to gro@@ w too much , because at some point the m@@ ass@@ es would be like c@@ attle that is her@@ ded in huge ch@@ ann@@ els .
we d@@ on &apos;@@ t want that .
during 13 years , the ide@@ ology of a successful event has been ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fied in a way that the area , partly dec@@ or@@ ated with arti@@ fic@@ ial tur@@ f , h@@ os@@ ts 1@@ 30 per@@ form@@ ers , ar@@ t ins@@ tall@@ ations , and a number of res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant points and co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il b@@ ars .
in addition to the main stage and the small@@ er sta@@ ges , this year there will be gi@@ gs in a tent ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ating 15@@ .@@ 000 people .
K@@ all@@ io ad@@ m@@ its that the event could be implemented also in a simp@@ ler way .
I may be a bit me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c , but at the same time , we have managed to re@@ tain the F@@ low spirit .
if you lose it , this is no longer our thing .
for K@@ all@@ io , the greatest jo@@ y and re@@ ward for the work done is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys even big v@@ isions are practic@@ ally possible .
in the early years of the event , mid 00@@ s , the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20@@ .@@ 000 euro@@ s from the c@@ ity of Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
last year the tur@@ no@@ ver of the limited company that manag@@ es F@@ low was about six million euro@@ s .
with it , it &apos;s possible to create &quot; even cra@@ z@@ y things , &quot; like building that tent 7@@ 3 me@@ ters wide .
the gu@@ es@@ ts at F@@ low have typ@@ ically expressed themselves with individual d@@ res@@ sing .
in addition to a mu@@ si@@ c event , one can also call this a community of tr@@ end@@ y young ad@@ ul@@ ts .
however , the event has not pur@@ pos@@ ely prof@@ iled itself as especially fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able .
above all , we want to stand out because of our content .
still , also F@@ A@@ D@@ s f@@ it in to F@@ low &apos;s set of values : cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and the desire to inte@@ rac@@ t with the environment , says K@@ all@@ io .
this year one of the main stage ar@@ tis@@ ts is a leg@@ end of pun@@ k , 6@@ 9 years old I@@ g@@ gy P@@ o@@ p .
in his own gen@@ re , the man has a huge f@@ an cro@@ w@@ d , but he is@@ n &apos;@@ t the most typ@@ ical per@@ former in a f@@ esti@@ val comb@@ in@@ ing in@@ di@@ e ro@@ ck , po@@ p mu@@ si@@ c , ra@@ p , and sou@@ l .
according to K@@ all@@ io I@@ g@@ gy was bo@@ ok@@ ed , since this is most likely the last time the ar@@ tis@@ t is gi@@ gg@@ ing in Fin@@ land .
we are interested in everything , history and future .
not just what is played in commercial radi@@ o .
I@@ g@@ gy &apos;s latest al@@ bu@@ m was blo@@ ody good , and he has per@@ for@@ med blo@@ ody well on his gi@@ gs in recent years .
the bom@@ bs in T@@ ha@@ i tou@@ ris@@ t par@@ ad@@ ise were hid@@ den in flo@@ wer po@@ ts - hor@@ ri@@ fied tou@@ ris@@ ts es@@ cap@@ ed
on Th@@ urs@@ day evening local time , two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded in H@@ ua H@@ in .
at least one local w@@ oman di@@ ed and over 20 were w@@ oun@@ ded in the attack .
the bom@@ bs were probably hid@@ den in a flo@@ wer po@@ t and then d@@ et@@ on@@ ated using cel@@ l p@@ hon@@ es .
the bom@@ bs were loc@@ ated on a stre@@ et where most of the custom@@ ers are foreign .
they w@@ ent off at the same time as the tou@@ ris@@ ts beg@@ an to leave the b@@ ars to go back to their ho@@ tel@@ s , said a police spo@@ kes@@ man Sa@@ mo@@ er Y@@ o@@ os@@ um@@ ran according to C@@ N@@ N .
a w@@ il@@ d@@ life protec@@ tion@@ ist E@@ w@@ in W@@ i@@ ek , who has li@@ ved in A@@ sia since 198@@ 9 , tw@@ e@@ e@@ ted a re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing im@@ age about the attacks .
if the tw@@ eet is@@ n &apos;@@ t visi@@ ble , you can see it here .
at least 11 of those w@@ oun@@ ded in H@@ ua H@@ in were foreign tou@@ ris@@ ts .
people were running towards me saying that a bom@@ b has explo@@ ded ne@@ ar the b@@ ars .
it happened on one of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est b@@ ar stre@@ ets , said Swedish tou@@ ris@@ t E@@ m@@ eli@@ e Ol@@ ss@@ on to A@@ f@@ ton@@ bla@@ d@@ et .
in the next morning local time two bom@@ bs w@@ ent off in S@@ ur@@ at T@@ han@@ i .
at least one di@@ ed .
the number of the w@@ oun@@ ded is not yet known .
very soon after this , two bom@@ bs w@@ ent off on the is@@ land of P@@ hu@@ ket that is pop@@ ular also among F@@ inn@@ s .
as far as is known , no@@ body di@@ ed .
at the same time there was another double bom@@ b@@ ing in H@@ ua H@@ in .
at least one di@@ ed and three were w@@ oun@@ ded .
in addition , one bom@@ b w@@ ent off in the to@@ wn of T@@ ran@@ g .
the police said they had found at least one bom@@ b from H@@ ua H@@ in that had not yet explo@@ ded .
according to the T@@ ha@@ i authorities , those responsible for the bom@@ b attacks are most likely re@@ be@@ l groups that are not satisfied with the actions of T@@ ha@@ il@@ and &apos;s military lead@@ ership .
the local authorities estima@@ te a criminal organisation might also be the cul@@ pri@@ t .
according to A@@ f@@ ton@@ bla@@ d@@ et , the police has la@@ tely been s@@ na@@ pp@@ ing at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking .
K@@ S@@ M@@ L : this part of the new read@@ in@@ ess un@@ its are the first to go into b@@ attle in war situations
in an ac@@ u@@ te war situation , the con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts w@@ on &apos;@@ t be sent to b@@ attle until several months after they have s@@ wor@@ n their o@@ ath , says K@@ es@@ k@@ is@@ u@@ om@@ ala@@ inen .
the new@@ s@@ paper inter@@ vie@@ wed the C@@ hi@@ ef of E@@ duc@@ ation of the F@@ inn@@ ish D@@ ef@@ ence For@@ ces , Bri@@ g@@ ad@@ i@@ er General Ju@@ k@@ ka S@@ onn@@ inen , who said that for example from those con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts that serve 5@@ ,@@ 5 months only those are effective who are fin@@ is@@ hing their training .
according to the C@@ hi@@ ef of E@@ duc@@ ation , the first ones to be called up are those reser@@ vis@@ ts who are part of the read@@ in@@ ess un@@ its .
no con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts or reser@@ vis@@ ts are called up to a duty they do not have the required training for , says S@@ onn@@ inen .
earlier in the sum@@ mer it was found out that the F@@ inn@@ ish D@@ ef@@ ence forces begin to tra@@ in con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts to read@@ in@@ ess un@@ its from the beginning of the next year .
the un@@ its can be used in military operations already during the con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t training , if necessary .
P@@ am@@ el@@ a T@@ ol@@ a got gi@@ ant in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication for a m@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ y home
ac@@ t@@ ress P@@ am@@ el@@ a T@@ ol@@ a and her ex@@ -@@ h@@ us@@ b@@ and , C@@ E@@ O Pa@@ ul@@ i W@@ ar@@ oma , have w@@ on a hard argument about a house they b@@ ought from Es@@ po@@ o in 200@@ 9 .
the pur@@ ch@@ ase price of a tw@@ o@@ -@@ sto@@ re@@ y deta@@ ched house had been 3@@ 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s .
after the clos@@ ing of the deal , a serious mo@@ istu@@ re problem was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed in the house , ca@@ using un@@ heal@@ thy m@@ ic@@ ro@@ be growth .
the cou@@ ple had to sel@@ l the house to be dem@@ ol@@ ished in 20@@ 14 .
the price had dro@@ pped to 13@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s , so T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma &apos;s financial los@@ s was no less than 198@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s .
the cou@@ ple f@@ iled the matter in court and there claim@@ ed a price reduction from the sell@@ er .
the sell@@ er con@@ tes@@ ted the claim , but T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma w@@ on the case in both the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court and the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al .
the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al passed judg@@ ement on the matter on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
it re@@ tained in force the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court judg@@ ement by which the sell@@ er was imposed to pay a price reduction of 15@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s to T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma .
in addition , the sell@@ er has to cover the cou@@ ple &apos;s legal and sett@@ l@@ ement costs for a total of 4@@ 7@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s .
the price reduction was made sli@@ ghtly equ@@ itable by the court , since bu@@ yers did know some of the house &apos;s needs for re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s when they were bu@@ ying the home .
however , according to the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als , the construction def@@ ec@@ ts that appe@@ ared were signific@@ antly more serious than what had been presented .
T@@ ol@@ a was looking for a house in good condition
at the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al T@@ ol@@ a told that the cou@@ ple had been specifically looking for a home in good condition , since they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t want to do re@@ pa@@ ir work .
she had for@@ med an understanding that the building had been ren@@ o@@ va@@ ted and was in good condition , and that there would be no dis@@ advantages from the matters mentioned in the condition inspec@@ tion report .
the risks and def@@ ec@@ ts mentioned in the condition inspec@@ tion report were ven@@ tila@@ tion and that the management of ra@@ in and mel@@ t waters running along the ro@@ ck sur@@ face was not sufficient .
based on the discussions it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t however re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that this would be an urgent matter at all .
T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma had the impression that the ra@@ in waters from the ro@@ ck should probably be sli@@ ghtly direc@@ ted within a cou@@ ple of years .
the deal was closed in October 200@@ 9 .
within a few years it appe@@ ared that the hu@@ mid@@ ity problems of the house were much more serious than pre@@ viously thought .
in inspec@@ tions in 20@@ 12 and 20@@ 13 , m@@ ic@@ ro@@ be growth was found from the building . according to wit@@ n@@ esses , this was caused both by the ro@@ ck ra@@ in waters and ear@@ th hu@@ mid@@ ity that had r@@ isen to the sur@@ face by cap@@ ill@@ ary action .
according to the inspec@@ tor &apos;s evaluation , on the w@@ est side of the house m@@ ic@@ ro@@ be@@ -@@ inf@@ es@@ ted air could also enter to the in@@ side of the house through the por@@ ch .
m@@ ou@@ ld or ye@@ ast that enab@@ les a health risk and exc@@ eed@@ s the limit values was found in s@@ me@@ ar sa@@ mp@@ les taken from the u@@ til@@ ity room , b@@ as@@ ement sta@@ ir@@ case , living room b@@ ay w@@ in@@ do@@ w , and b@@ as@@ ement w@@ ash@@ room .
the pati@@ os were buil@@ t without per@@ m@@ its .
there was also argument in the court about whether the house had been extended against the building per@@ mit .
the court held that before clos@@ ing of the deal , T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma were not aware of the Es@@ po@@ o c@@ ity decision that there had been changes to the house that were against the per@@ mit .
for example the pati@@ os had been buil@@ t even though there were no proper per@@ m@@ its yet .
however , the m@@ ou@@ ld problems were the crucial matter at court .
according to the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al , based on the information they got from the sell@@ er before the deal , the bu@@ yers had reason to assume that the building was su@@ itable for living as is , and that there was no need for large re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s in the ne@@ ar future .
in the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al &apos;s opinion , T@@ ol@@ a and W@@ ar@@ oma had no special reason to conduct an un@@ us@@ u@@ ally exten@@ sive inspec@@ tion .
the bu@@ yers have not neg@@ lec@@ ted their duty to investig@@ ate , stated the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al in its decision .

n@@ one of S@@ S men in Na@@ z@@ i Germany were allowed to have children before they were examin@@ ed by an S@@ S do@@ c@@ tor .
the same was even more true to women , who had to be able to give b@@ ir@@ th to even more than 10 children .
according to An@@ der@@ ss@@ on , women were given g@@ y@@ na@@ ec@@ ological examin@@ ations to confirm this .
the R@@ ace Office chec@@ ked the women &apos;s back@@ grounds by chec@@ king for example the ch@@ ur@@ ch regis@@ ters .
the goal was to ensure that there were no J@@ e@@ ws in the women &apos;s family tre@@ e .
the women also had to be ready to give up their Swedish citiz@@ en@@ ship , and to give the R@@ ace Office their hand@@ written bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ ies , and good refer@@ ences from their next of kin .
the R@@ ace Office wanted guarantees of the women being &quot; f@@ ond of children , &quot; &quot; fru@@ g@@ al , &quot; and &quot; good N@@ ational Socialists , &quot; who could speak German well .
the women who did not fulfil these requirements were not accepted as br@@ id@@ es for the S@@ S men .
the s@@ tory does not tell , what happened to the 14 F@@ inn@@ ish women found from the ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve &apos;s documents .
the S@@ S leaders created a sta@@ te@@ -@@ supported programme known as L@@ eb@@ ens@@ bor@@ n in 19@@ 36 .
the programme for example determined that each S@@ S men should have four children , either in or out of w@@ ed@@ lo@@ ck .
L@@ eb@@ ens@@ bor@@ n hom@@ es took care of the children bor@@ n out of w@@ ed@@ lo@@ ck and their mo@@ th@@ ers .
the programme was not very acti@@ vely promo@@ ted , though , it says on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e of the United States H@@ ol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust M@@ em@@ or@@ ial M@@ use@@ um .
instead , the Na@@ z@@ i population policies were foc@@ used on family and mar@@ ri@@ age .
the state encoura@@ ged mar@@ rying by offer@@ ing lo@@ ans and supported having children .
the C@@ ross of H@@ on@@ or of the German M@@ other was given to women , who had bor@@ ne at least four children .
mar@@ ri@@ ages between &quot; Ar@@ y@@ ans &quot; and &quot; n@@ on@@ -@@ Ar@@ y@@ ans &quot; were for@@ b@@ id@@ den by law in Na@@ z@@ i Germany , it is stated on the m@@ use@@ um we@@ b@@ sit@@ e .
Pe@@ t@@ ä@@ j@@ ä@@ -@@ S@@ ir@@ en si@@ x@@ th , N@@ ir@@ k@@ k@@ o ro@@ se and dro@@ pped
T@@ ap@@ io N@@ ir@@ k@@ k@@ o placed third in the first start of the first Fin@@ n competition day at Ri@@ o Ol@@ ymp@@ ics , but was left the very last in the second start of the day .
N@@ ir@@ k@@ k@@ o ro@@ se to ei@@ gh@@ th place in the total points after five star@@ ts , but the failure in the second start dro@@ pped him to place 14 .
T@@ uu@@ l@@ i Pe@@ t@@ ä@@ j@@ ä@@ -@@ S@@ ir@@ en f@@ ought for places 17 and three in the day &apos;s R@@ S : X clas@@ s &quot; star@@ ts .
Pe@@ t@@ ä@@ j@@ ä@@ -@@ S@@ ir@@ en is si@@ x@@ th in the total points .
in the 4@@ 70 clas@@ s , J@@ o@@ on@@ as and N@@ ik@@ la@@ s L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren were left on place 23 in the opening start of the day .
the L@@ ind@@ gr@@ ens are 19@@ th in the total points .
J@@ ar@@ i S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä &apos;s Sa@@ tu@@ l@@ inn@@ a was rec@@ ord@@ ed after a cou@@ ple of hours s@@ le@@ ep : &quot; I was so hun@@ g@@ -@@ over &quot;
J@@ ar@@ i S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä has been one of the F@@ inn@@ s &quot; fav@@ our@@ ite ar@@ tis@@ ts already for over 20 years .
from a bar@@ man on a cru@@ ise ship to tan@@ go K@@ ing in 1995 , to the bes@@ t@@ -@@ sell@@ ing sol@@ o ar@@ tis@@ t in Fin@@ land and to a sta@@ r of d@@ ance pa@@ vil@@ ions and f@@ esti@@ val - S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä just ke@@ ep@@ s ro@@ ll@@ ing along , and has a great mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m at the moment .
the bo@@ ok , J@@ ar@@ i S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä - Pal@@ ja@@ ana , written by Mar@@ i K@@ opp@@ inen , tell@@ s about the life of the fav@@ our@@ ite sing@@ er and was published today , on Th@@ urs@@ day .
in the bo@@ ok S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä n@@ ar@@ rates his life and care@@ er , be it positive or negative .
S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä &quot; s care@@ er so@@ ared when he w@@ on the cro@@ wn of the tan@@ go K@@ ing at Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki T@@ ang@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ k@@ in@@ at f@@ esti@@ val in 1995 .
in the competition S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä san@@ g tan@@ go@@ s , but already then he had planned somewhat different mu@@ si@@ c for him@@ self .
in the s@@ pr@@ ing of 1995 , Ju@@ k@@ ka K@@ u@@ op@@ pa@@ m@@ ä@@ ki had com@@ posed a tan@@ go for S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä at his request , and K@@ ass@@ u H@@ al@@ on@@ en then ar@@ ran@@ ged it to a sli@@ ghtly different form .
and the s@@ ong &apos; Sa@@ tu@@ l@@ inn@@ a &quot; did become one of the most pop@@ ular s@@ ong@@ s in F@@ inn@@ ish mu@@ si@@ c history .
the bo@@ ok tell@@ s that the rec@@ ord@@ ing of the s@@ ong did not quite go according to plans : S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä had a terri@@ ble han@@ go@@ ver when he san@@ g the s@@ ong on ta@@ pe , and he had only s@@ le@@ p@@ t for a cou@@ ple of hours .
we &apos;@@ d had a party the previous night .
I was so hun@@ g@@ -@@ over !
S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä rec@@ all@@ s in the bo@@ ok .
based on the rec@@ ord@@ ing of the s@@ ong that bec@@ a@@ me an enormous h@@ it , one W@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t gu@@ ess that it was san@@ g while han@@ go@@ ver .
even though I w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t p@@ hy@@ si@@ cally at my best , the result was still good .
I lear@@ ned that you d@@ on &apos;@@ t have to require perfec@@ tion and top result from y@@ our@@ self all the time .
another inc@@ ident , n@@ ar@@ rated in the bo@@ ok and relating to his most pop@@ ular s@@ ong@@ s , happened almost two dec@@ ad@@ es later .
in 20@@ 13 , S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä separ@@ ated from his then part@@ ner , and the inc@@ ident also en@@ ded up in the texts of &apos; S@@ in@@ ä an@@ sa@@ it@@ s@@ et k@@ u@@ l@@ ta@@ a &quot; s@@ ong that was published as a single in 20@@ 14 .
the bo@@ ok relates that the l@@ yr@@ ics that were com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed from S@@ aar@@ a T@@ ö@@ r@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ en w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t what S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä would &apos;@@ ve wanted .
S@@ ill@@ an@@ p@@ ä@@ ä had imag@@ ined he was doing a record that tell@@ s a true s@@ tory of his own life , but the l@@ yr@@ ics of the s@@ ong about bre@@ ak@@ -@@ up w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t true , but written based on a pi@@ ece of ne@@ ws from 7 p@@ ä@@ i@@ v@@ ä@@ ä ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
in the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ar@@ ticle the reason given for the bre@@ ak@@ -@@ up between J@@ ar@@ i and his ex@@ -@@ lo@@ ve was J@@ ar@@ i &apos;s excessive par@@ ty@@ ing and d@@ rin@@ king , but this is pur@@ e n@@ on@@ sense according to J@@ ar@@ i and simply not true .
according to bo@@ ok , J@@ ar@@ i was fu@@ ri@@ ous when he called to the record company and ref@@ used to sing the s@@ ong , but finally decided on sing@@ ing it - and that &apos;s good .
in June the Br@@ its managed to surpris@@ e even themselves by voting their k@@ ing@@ dom out of the EU .
in the end , 5@@ 2 per cent of the vo@@ ters supported the ex@@ it and 48 per cent would have sta@@ yed in the union , even though the opinion p@@ oll@@ s from the vote week anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted an opposite result .
the econom@@ ists and economic institutions of Bri@@ tain were ne@@ arly unanim@@ ous in supporting sta@@ ying in the EU .
not one of the respected research institu@@ tes or univers@@ ities carried the ex@@ it fla@@ g , even though a cou@@ ple of individual res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers d@@ ared to di@@ ffer from the ma@@ ins@@ tre@@ am of their prof@@ ession .
the basic man@@ tra of the W@@ estern politics , the cat@@ ch@@ ph@@ r@@ ase from the election campaign of the ex@@ -@@ US President B@@ ill C@@ lin@@ ton , &quot; I@@ t &apos;s the economy , stu@@ pid , &quot; was sc@@ rap@@ p@@ ed in Bri@@ tain &apos;s B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote .
the econom@@ ists were sho@@ c@@ ked , when their vo@@ ices were not heard .
they were sho@@ c@@ ked , when it seem@@ ed that economy was not the most important thing in politics .
economic cur@@ ly speech
in its latest mon@@ th@@ ly ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire , the C@@ entr@@ e for ma@@ cro@@ econom@@ ics demands answ@@ ers for B@@ re@@ x@@ it disaster from the professional society .
the most typ@@ ical answer is that the econom@@ ists were not lis@@ tened to , because this time the vo@@ ters based their decision on something other than economic grounds .
one econom@@ ist explanation for the los@@ s of economy &apos;s position is that people do not understand the economy .
many still have an im@@ age that the number of jobs does not depen@@ d on the number of working people , so that it is almost constan@@ t .
if an immi@@ grant gets a job , it is taken from a real Bri@@ t .
many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fel@@ l , since it promo@@ tes the ex@@ porting indus@@ tries .
according to the econom@@ ist base , the vo@@ ters did not believe the economic arguments , since the unanim@@ ity of the econom@@ ists did not come up enough .
they were especially an@@ no@@ yed by the B@@ B@@ C im@@ parti@@ ality that gave the same space both to those econom@@ ists supporting the EU ex@@ it that only present a cou@@ ple of per cent of the econom@@ ist base , and the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority .
the press , h@@ os@@ ti@@ le to EU , were not interested in men@@ tioning what i@@ f@@ s , I@@ F@@ M , Bo@@ E , C@@ E@@ P@@ R , L@@ SE , and other power@@ ful economic letter comb@@ in@@ ations thought of the ex@@ it consequences .
those dis@@ tant letter comb@@ in@@ ations spoke fac@@ el@@ ess@@ ly about economic growth , trade relations , national debt , and currency .
and if the econom@@ ists &quot; messa@@ ges were both lis@@ tened to and understood , then they were dis@@ regar@@ ded , because the econom@@ ists present such el@@ ite with which the vo@@ ters do not think to have anything in common .
the big c@@ ity ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ics such as econom@@ ists would have sta@@ yed in the EU , but in small to@@ w@@ ns and in coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side the message was ine@@ ffec@@ tive .
immigration is also economy
the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming w@@ inning argument in the B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote concerned immigration .
an immi@@ grant will take your job , an immi@@ grant will ja@@ m your h@@ os@@ pi@@ tal@@ s , an immi@@ grant will abuse you .
these were the arguments that worked .
every CA@@ F@@ E has foreign employees .
how many more jobs would the Br@@ its have , if they were to leave ?
there are immigrants in every waiting room of every health centre .
how much easier would it be for a Bri@@ t to have a do@@ c@@ tor &apos;s ap@@ poin@@ tment , if they w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t here ?
every scho@@ ol has immigrants &quot; children , too .
how much easier would it be for the children of a true Bri@@ t to have a scho@@ ol place , if we could get ri@@ d of them ?
there are fore@@ ig@@ ners living in every mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity .
how much more space would the na@@ tives have , if they would van@@ ish ?
I feel these are economic questions .
they concern jobs , ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ation , and public services .
the econom@@ ists did not manage to answer them , however , and even if they did , their answ@@ ers did not get any visi@@ bility .
the econom@@ ists did not succeed in expla@@ in@@ ing that thanks to immigrants , the Br@@ its have more jobs , less health centre qu@@ e@@ ues , and more money in education and social security than before .
immigrants , and above all EU immigrants , are net contribu@@ tors to the British public economy , and their spending cre@@ ates jobs .
A@@ ber@@ d@@ een real es@@ ta@@ te fund prepared for B@@ re@@ x@@ it with cas@@ h
one of the funds was A@@ ber@@ d@@ een ass@@ et Man@@ ag@@ ement , whose real es@@ ta@@ te investments are managed by a Fin@@ n Per@@ t@@ ti V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
according to him , A@@ ber@@ d@@ een prepared for B@@ re@@ x@@ it in time by working out A and B plans .
the prepar@@ ation for P@@ l@@ an B , the vic@@ tory of those supporting lea@@ ving EU , beg@@ an more closely a cou@@ ple of weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave .
the concern was that the inves@@ tors would begin to with@@ draw their funds away from the market .
us@@ u@@ ally a real es@@ ta@@ te fund does not have large li@@ qu@@ id ass@@ ets , but now they could be necessary .
we beg@@ an to increase cas@@ h ass@@ ets .
when B@@ re@@ x@@ it happened on the 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d , we had 25 per cent of the fund investments either in cas@@ h or as li@@ qu@@ id ass@@ ets , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en about A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s only daily quo@@ ted real es@@ ta@@ te fund the ne@@ ws concerned .
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , the normal level would be 15@@ -@@ 20 per cent .
the fund value then was £ 3@@ .@@ 5 b@@ n .
us@@ u@@ ally the company &apos;s funds &quot; value is about £ 20 b@@ n .
this is the highest amount in n@@ ine open@@ -@@ end real es@@ ta@@ te funds , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says about all open@@ -@@ end real es@@ ta@@ te funds in Bri@@ tain .
he estima@@ tes that the low@@ est cas@@ h amount in these funds remain@@ ed at 10 per cent or even lower .
so the real es@@ ta@@ te funds had very different strateg@@ ies in preparing for B@@ re@@ x@@ it .
funds clos@@ ing the trade
when the cam@@ p supporting EU ex@@ it w@@ on , Europe w@@ ent ma@@ d .
about two weeks following the vote were , however , very qu@@ i@@ et on the real es@@ ta@@ te market , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
then two things happened that changed the situation .
the first was a speech by Mar@@ k Car@@ ne@@ y , the Govern@@ or of the Bank of Eng@@ land , in which he estima@@ ted that B@@ re@@ x@@ it can be a big risk for commercial real es@@ ta@@ te ac@@ tors .
in addition , the first of the real es@@ ta@@ te funds , S@@ tan@@ d@@ ard Li@@ f@@ e , fro@@ z@@ e its trade .
these together turned the situation up@@ side down , and highli@@ ghted the issue in the head@@ lines of the Finan@@ cial T@@ imes and the B@@ B@@ C .
the situation was immediately compared to years 200@@ 7 and 200@@ 8 , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
this made the inves@@ tors ner@@ v@@ ous .
the institutional inves@@ tors sta@@ yed cal@@ mer , but the private inves@@ tors were ner@@ v@@ ous .
the s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all beg@@ an to ro@@ l@@ l , and a fund after another had to close its do@@ ors .
the A@@ ber@@ d@@ een situation was good because of the collec@@ ted cas@@ h ass@@ ets , but in the end it , too , had to fre@@ ez@@ e its trade for six days .
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , they did not exactly close the trade , but changed the pr@@ ic@@ ing do@@ w@@ n@@ wards .
in practice , the inves@@ tors were given , according to him , time to consider whether they should with@@ draw the money in pan@@ ic .
the message of A@@ ber@@ d@@ een was that if you do not have to with@@ draw your money now , it is not prof@@ itable , because it would result in los@@ ses .
that cal@@ med the situation , and the most can@@ cell@@ ed their no@@ tice .
after that , things have been quite even , and for a cou@@ ple of weeks now , the market has been very cal@@ m , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
he no@@ tes that for example A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s Con@@ tin@@ en@@ tal Europe funds have had no such ag@@ itation .
there were a lot of in@@ qu@@ iri@@ es , though .
excessive attention to real es@@ ta@@ te funds
according to V@@ an@@ han@@ en , the sto@@ ps of real es@@ ta@@ te funds &quot; tra@@ ding got excessive attention .
the open@@ -@@ end funds the clos@@ ing affected control about four per cent of the British es@@ ta@@ tes .
the A@@ ber@@ d@@ een stop las@@ ted six days , and the company sol@@ d less than 10 of its 80 es@@ ta@@ tes loc@@ ated in L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
some other funds are still closed .
this week , A@@ vi@@ va In@@ ves@@ tors war@@ ned its inves@@ tors that it may keep its funds closed until 20@@ 17 .
at the moment there is a lot of un@@ certainty around , and the economy growth pre@@ dic@@ tions have been adjus@@ ted do@@ w@@ n@@ wards , but the situation does not look &quot; w@@ il@@ der &quot; rela@@ tive to A@@ ber@@ d@@ een .
the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est questions now rela@@ te to the future development of British national economy .
despite the un@@ certainty , the situation has brought even new pos@@ sibilities to some real es@@ ta@@ te inves@@ tors , no@@ tes V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the p@@ ound and doll@@ ar rates are low@@ est in 30 years , and there is a 15 per cent dis@@ coun@@ t on the market compared to pre@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote time period .
a doll@@ ar bu@@ yer can now bu@@ y the same es@@ ta@@ te for as much as 30 per cent less .
there are a low of willing bu@@ yers , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it brought dra@@ w@@ bac@@ ks to L@@ on@@ d@@ on proper@@ ty market
at two o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck in the morning , the situation did not yet look too good .
but at four , when Per@@ t@@ ti V@@ an@@ han@@ en , who is in charge of British real es@@ ta@@ te fund A@@ ber@@ d@@ een ass@@ et Man@@ ag@@ ement &apos;s proper@@ ty investments , w@@ o@@ ke up to re@@ chec@@ k the results of the B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote , the situation had changed .
I had to use a s@@ we@@ ar@@ word .
I realis@@ ed that we had to soon rely on plan B , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says in his other home in Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
he head@@ ed for work stra@@ ight away .
L@@ on@@ d@@ on C@@ ity was already full a@@ wa@@ ke , despite it still being the small hours .
the T@@ V s@@ cre@@ ens in the office , us@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ted , were now b@@ lar@@ ing the ne@@ ws , and the people , us@@ u@@ ally lou@@ d , were completely sil@@ ent and lis@@ tening to Prime Minister D@@ avi@@ d Ca@@ mer@@ on as he ste@@ pped in fron@@ t of the ca@@ mer@@ a in the morning to tell about his res@@ ig@@ nation .
when the market open@@ ed , the termin@@ als were all b@@ lin@@ king red .
it was a morning you &apos;@@ d never expect to live , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
not just because , despite the tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ence , A@@ ber@@ d@@ een , one of the larg@@ est real es@@ ta@@ te funds in Bri@@ tain , fin@@ alised two real es@@ ta@@ te de@@ als on the day after the B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote , at M@@ id@@ sum@@ mer .
the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here was conf@@ used .
the company had been preparing well for this alternative , and in that sense , the situation was kind of cal@@ m , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
the B@@ re@@ x@@ it vote beg@@ an a correc@@ tion
a stor@@ m followed the vote .
the p@@ ound coll@@ ap@@ sed , the comm@@ and of Bri@@ tain was changed .
the market beg@@ an to anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate he@@ av@@ y fall in British real es@@ ta@@ te market , and especially in L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
the dec@@ line in L@@ on@@ d@@ on office space was anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted to be as much as 20 per cent in the following years .
soon a number of British real es@@ ta@@ te funds beg@@ an to fre@@ ez@@ e their trade , one after another .
also A@@ ber@@ d@@ een did that for six days .
now the stor@@ m has ab@@ ated , but there is still un@@ certainty in the air .
however , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t show on the face of V@@ an@@ han@@ en , who was spending his final sum@@ mer va@@ c@@ ation days this week in Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
according to him , it is still too early to say much about the consequences of B@@ re@@ x@@ it .
so much is still open : how the ex@@ it will happen , and how Scot@@ land will re@@ act to the situation , for example .
there have already been some early information about the development of L@@ on@@ d@@ on real es@@ ta@@ te market .
the price development data from a real es@@ ta@@ te service company C@@ B@@ R@@ E cover about a third of the market .
according to this data , all the real es@@ ta@@ te prices in L@@ on@@ d@@ on w@@ ent down 3@@ ,@@ 3 per cent from June to July .
in L@@ on@@ d@@ on C@@ ity office buil@@ dings the price dro@@ p was 6@@ ,@@ 1 per cent , lis@@ ts V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the num@@ bers are not so bad , but they are mon@@ th@@ ly changes .
the mon@@ th@@ ly inde@@ x publis@@ hing was beg@@ an in 198@@ 7 , and there have been worse num@@ bers only in five months , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
all the dro@@ ps as big as this co@@ inc@@ id@@ ed with the crisis years of 200@@ 7 and 200@@ 8 .
this is interesting also because B@@ re@@ x@@ it was very quickly compared to L@@ eh@@ man fall and the global economy crisis that beg@@ an from the U@@ .@@ S@@ . real es@@ ta@@ te market .
V@@ an@@ han@@ en thin@@ ks that this compar@@ is@@ on is not quite ap@@ pos@@ ite , because this is a hom@@ es@@ pu@@ n British crisis .
even the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here is different .
there has been no pan@@ ic sell@@ ing like then , but more a will@@ ing@@ ness to sel@@ l in order to improve li@@ qu@@ id@@ ity , V@@ an@@ han@@ en says .
even the financing is normal .
we could have faced a correc@@ tion in any case
as a matter of fact , he thin@@ ks the price correc@@ tion is not a mi@@ rac@@ le , we could have faced that in any case , even without B@@ re@@ x@@ it .
according to A@@ ber@@ d@@ een &apos;s esti@@ mation , the real es@@ ta@@ te prices in L@@ on@@ d@@ on and other number one c@@ ities in the world have been too high already for years .
for two years now , we have said that the C@@ ity and especially the offic@@ es are over@@ pr@@ ic@@ ed , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
therefore the dro@@ p beg@@ an from very high .
there are four reasons , why L@@ on@@ d@@ on prices have cl@@ im@@ b@@ ed up , lis@@ ts V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
the British economy has gro@@ wn strongly , and so has the population in L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
another big tr@@ end is that the real es@@ ta@@ te is the last clas@@ s of ow@@ nership to be glob@@ alised , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
there are new market ac@@ tors from the Middle East and A@@ sia , and more and more institutions and also private inves@@ tors are looking for real es@@ ta@@ te investments ab@@ road .
as a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known c@@ ity , L@@ on@@ d@@ on is an easy target .
in addition , the prices have been f@@ ed by the low interest level that has dri@@ ven for example the pension administration organisations to seek prof@@ its from new targets .
and , on top of that , lo@@ an has been easi@@ ly available , even though V@@ an@@ han@@ en says that the le@@ ver@@ age has been used clearly less than during the bo@@ om before the 200@@ 8 crisis .
di@@ versi@@ fy , di@@ versi@@ fy
the price as@@ cent in L@@ on@@ d@@ on was sta@@ bil@@ ised last sum@@ mer , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
even A@@ ber@@ d@@ een beg@@ an to li@@ gh@@ ten their hol@@ dings in L@@ on@@ d@@ on , and was indeed a net sell@@ er last year .
some kind of a turn was to be expected , and here it is .
what will happen now ?
it depen@@ ds on how British national economy will develop , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
he does not d@@ are to estima@@ te much , but he says that there will probably be no b@@ oun@@ ce .
the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here indic@@ ates that the going will be do@@ w@@ n@@ ward or level .
V@@ an@@ han@@ en has already seen several up and down mo@@ v@@ ements , because he has been in the real es@@ ta@@ te business since 198@@ 8 .
and he is still an optimis@@ t who believes that work will see us through hol@@ es .
if you are well prepared for risks , you have a better position .
he believes in global di@@ versi@@ fication .
if you have inves@@ ted too much in one market , you are its victi@@ m .
if you have di@@ versi@@ fied , also the risks have been di@@ versi@@ fied , says V@@ an@@ han@@ en .
s Group to start regis@@ tering sh@@ opp@@ ing information more closely
soon the S Group will know what you e@@ at , because today the business group declar@@ ed that it will begin to collec@@ t even more precise information about its co@@ -@@ o@@ p members &quot; pur@@ ch@@ ases .
when so far the information ga@@ ther@@ ed has been of the total amount of a rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t , in the beginning of May the Group will ho@@ ard it also about the ite@@ ms pur@@ ch@@ ased .
here the S Group follow@@ s after K@@ es@@ ko , since information about ite@@ ms pur@@ ch@@ ased with a K@@ -@@ P@@ l@@ us@@ sa c@@ ard has been ga@@ ther@@ ed to K@@ es@@ ko &apos;s custom@@ er regis@@ ter already for a cou@@ ple of years .
according to K@@ -@@ P@@ lu@@ s O@@ y Man@@ ag@@ ing Direc@@ tor Is@@ m@@ o Ri@@ i@@ tal@@ a , the fe@@ ed@@ back from the programme has been mainly positive .
I@@ tem@@ -@@ specific information is ga@@ ther@@ ed with the con@@ sent of the custom@@ er , and it is used to market@@ ing subject to per@@ mission .
the most effective chan@@ nel is em@@ ai@@ l .
very few custom@@ ers have for@@ b@@ id@@ den the use of product information , Ri@@ i@@ tal@@ a says to T@@ al@@ ous@@ san@@ om@@ at .
according to him , K@@ es@@ ko will not re@@ act to S Group &apos;s regis@@ tering change .
K@@ es@@ ko classi@@ f@@ ies its regula@@ r custom@@ ers to ten different groups simply based on gro@@ cer@@ ies alone .
the classi@@ fication is up@@ d@@ ated mon@@ th@@ ly .
the regula@@ r custom@@ ers are also classi@@ fied according to the number of pur@@ ch@@ ased ite@@ ms and the money used .
the information is used to target market@@ ing to the custom@@ er .
I@@ tem@@ -@@ specific information is ga@@ ther@@ ed only from K@@ -@@ Group &apos;s own cha@@ ins .
partners , like for example N@@ es@@ te O@@ il , do not give away their information .
L@@ id@@ l Fin@@ land do not have a custom@@ er lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programme , and currently they are not planning for one , either .
Su@@ omen L@@ ä@@ h@@ ik@@ au@@ p@@ pa has its own Y@@ k@@ k@@ ö@@ s@@ b@@ on@@ us custom@@ er lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programme one can join in a Val@@ in@@ ta@@ tal@@ o , S@@ i@@ w@@ a or Euro@@ market .
currently we do not collec@@ t information on product level or on product group level , we sta@@ y at the level of the rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t &apos;s total amount .
so we know where the sh@@ opp@@ ing was done , on what day , and what was the total of the custom@@ er &apos;s rec@@ ei@@ p@@ t .
we have not gone to K@@ -@@ Group &apos;s or S Group &apos;s level , says Bus@@ in@@ ess manag@@ er An@@ u Or@@ a .
according to her , there are plans about re@@ form@@ ing the custom@@ er lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty programme in the future , but L@@ ä@@ h@@ ik@@ au@@ p@@ pa will tell about it later .
however , Or@@ a does not promis@@ e that they would start regis@@ tering item information .
an exper@@ im@@ ent at first
S@@ ok &apos;s co@@ -@@ o@@ p member and custom@@ er regis@@ ter has already thus far been rela@@ tively comprehensive .

v@@ ide@@ o : pu@@ pp@@ y He@@ il@@ a is the new@@ est do@@ g reinfor@@ cement of the F@@ inn@@ ish C@@ us@@ tom@@ s - the pu@@ pp@@ y will be the first explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ g
a b@@ lack L@@ ab@@ rad@@ or re@@ tri@@ ever pu@@ pp@@ y is ener@@ ge@@ tically s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing five similar bo@@ x@@ es , ar@@ ran@@ ged in a row on the ground at Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port .
in no time at all , it decid@@ ed@@ ly sit next to the bo@@ x in the centre .
custom@@ s inspec@@ tor L@@ ass@@ i S@@ un@@ ti@@ o re@@ wards his do@@ g He@@ il@@ a by using its fav@@ our@@ ite to@@ y to play with the do@@ g .
from the bo@@ x He@@ il@@ a s@@ at next to , a can of car@@ tr@@ id@@ ge cases that sm@@ el@@ l like g@@ un@@ pow@@ der gas was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed .
g@@ un@@ pow@@ der gas is the first sc@@ ent we have been now prac@@ tis@@ ing with He@@ il@@ a , says S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , the ow@@ ner of the pu@@ pp@@ y .
security situation and e@@ -@@ commer@@ ce the main reasons
He@@ il@@ a is the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s &quot; first do@@ g speci@@ alised in se@@ ar@@ ching for arms and explo@@ si@@ ves , and it will be placed to Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port next year .
if need be , work du@@ ties might take He@@ il@@ a and S@@ un@@ ti@@ o also to other points of entry and to har@@ b@@ our .
the air@@ port will , however , be He@@ il@@ a &apos;s main work place , since the international security situation has changed on account of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe .
the attacks in Par@@ is and Brussels caused the custom@@ s to take measures , and after the attacks , control has been strength@@ ened , says Su@@ per@@ vision Direc@@ tor M@@ ik@@ ko G@@ rö@@ n@@ ber@@ g from the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s .
another main reason for training an arms and explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ g for the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s , are the pos@@ tal ite@@ ms that are carried via Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port .
with the gro@@ wn on@@ line sal@@ es , there are up to about 40 million pos@@ tal ite@@ ms carried via Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port every year , and these may include arms equipment and explo@@ sive materi@@ als ord@@ ered from ab@@ road .
in recent years , the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s has dis@@ covered about 300 fin@@ dings related to g@@ un@@ s , gu@@ n parts , am@@ mun@@ ition and explo@@ sive materi@@ als and their basic materi@@ als from the Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port .
He@@ il@@ a will work across Hel@@ sin@@ ki air@@ port .
it will examine regis@@ tered lu@@ gg@@ age and pos@@ tal ite@@ ms .
it will be a great advantage at har@@ bour@@ s in the future , as it can se@@ ar@@ ch large c@@ rate areas and mark those areas that require a more thorou@@ gh investig@@ ation , says G@@ rö@@ n@@ ber@@ g .
based on how He@@ il@@ a will per@@ form , the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s decid@@ es whether they will tra@@ in more arms and explo@@ si@@ ves do@@ gs in the future .
G@@ rö@@ n@@ ber@@ g is h@@ ope@@ ful about that .
a scho@@ ol at K@@ ir@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ um@@ mi
pu@@ pp@@ y He@@ il@@ a &apos;s training is coordin@@ ated by the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s D@@ o@@ g Tra@@ in@@ ing C@@ entr@@ e , loc@@ ated at K@@ ir@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ um@@ mi .
S@@ un@@ ti@@ o and He@@ il@@ a will also be train@@ ed by the Pol@@ ice and F@@ inn@@ ish D@@ ef@@ ence For@@ ces experts .
the Pol@@ ice have strong experience on do@@ g training , and the D@@ ef@@ ence For@@ ces on explo@@ si@@ ves .
the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s decide together with other authorities what sc@@ ents He@@ il@@ a is tau@@ ght to recognise .
He@@ il@@ a will be further train@@ ed as is necessary , says G@@ rö@@ n@@ ber@@ g .
He@@ il@@ a &apos;s colleagues at Hel@@ sin@@ ki A@@ ir@@ port are the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s &quot; six dru@@ g do@@ gs and the money and dru@@ g do@@ g M@@ ass@@ i .
L@@ ab@@ rad@@ or re@@ tri@@ ever He@@ il@@ a has been ch@@ os@@ en from a l@@ itte@@ r of ten pu@@ pp@@ ies .
when cho@@ os@@ ing a do@@ g for air@@ port , the selec@@ tion criteria include acti@@ veness , hun@@ ting ins@@ t@@ inc@@ t , and cal@@ m@@ ness , because the do@@ g will deal with g@@ un@@ s , explo@@ si@@ ves , and stre@@ am@@ s of people .
He@@ il@@ a , who lives with S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , is a close fellow wor@@ ker of the custom@@ s inspec@@ tor , but also a family member .
you can &apos;@@ t go any@@ where at home without He@@ il@@ a , lau@@ gh@@ s S@@ un@@ ti@@ o .
sub@@ t@@ le orders cl@@ ic@@ k with He@@ il@@ a at the first go .
the ca@@ mer@@ a@@ man from I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at los@@ es his ca@@ mer@@ a M@@ I@@ C cover to the f@@ ast do@@ g , but He@@ il@@ a gives the cover that loo@@ ks like a so@@ ft to@@ y back immediately after hear@@ ing the comm@@ and &quot; let go . &quot;
hard competition for u@@ til@@ ity do@@ gs
H@@ ella &apos;s early training will be ready next year .
there still are pla@@ cement tes@@ ts ahead , the next one in October , when it will be assess@@ ed whether the training is adequate for the exac@@ ting work tasks .
if everything goes according to plans , He@@ il@@ a can be seen working at Hel@@ sin@@ ki A@@ ir@@ port next year .
unfortunately the passeng@@ ers cannot p@@ et the do@@ g we@@ aring a work w@@ est , remin@@ ds S@@ un@@ ti@@ o .
one u@@ til@@ ity do@@ g &apos;s expen@@ ses for the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s are about 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ 7@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s per year .
their work age is about s@@ even to eight years , possibly even ten , after which they re@@ ti@@ re to their ow@@ ner &apos;s care .
the work days can be long , from eight to ten hours , but the active work sec@@ tions only last from ten minu@@ tes to a cou@@ ple of hours .
there is hard competition at the C@@ us@@ tom@@ s for the ow@@ nership of u@@ til@@ ity do@@ gs .
about 20@@ -@@ 30 C@@ us@@ tom@@ s workers applied to be H@@ ella &apos;s ow@@ ner .
the lu@@ ck@@ y one was S@@ un@@ ti@@ o , who has not had a work do@@ g before , but he has a long experience with do@@ gs and C@@ us@@ tom@@ s &quot; super@@ vision tasks .

we were looking for a strik@@ er with good capac@@ ities , who would sett@@ le in easi@@ ly to Fin@@ land and to Ro@@ van@@ i@@ em@@ i .
together with 10 pla@@ yer ag@@ ents we w@@ ent through over 50 pla@@ yers from all over the world .
little by little , Pro@@ sa beg@@ an to stand out as a good option , said Ro@@ P@@ S co@@ ach J@@ uh@@ a Mal@@ inen in a press rele@@ ase .
Pro@@ sa , 25 , come to Ro@@ P@@ S from a T@@ all@@ in@@ n te@@ am F@@ lor@@ a , where he s@@ co@@ red a total of 51 goals in 10@@ 9 mat@@ ches .
he has also played for the Es@@ ton@@ ian national te@@ am .

w@@ in@@ ter was p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed in H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood this week we@@ aring ho@@ t pan@@ ts that d@@ on &apos;@@ t leave much to the imag@@ ination .
the shor@@ ts re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed not only the ac@@ t@@ ress &quot; leg@@ s , but also her behind .
18@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ old W@@ in@@ ter has la@@ tely at@@ trac@@ ted attention by changing her sty@@ le and behaviour to consider@@ ably more d@@ aring .
the sta@@ r has published pic@@ tures of her pos@@ ing while we@@ aring very little in the social media , and she has taken several ta@@ t@@ to@@ os .
the young w@@ oman has also been seen we@@ aring extremely s@@ k@@ im@@ p@@ y out@@ f@@ its .
w@@ in@@ ter , who is on the th@@ res@@ hold of ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood , has la@@ tely also published several pic@@ tures of her@@ self par@@ ty@@ ing .
if the im@@ age is@@ n &apos;@@ t visi@@ ble , you can see it here .
earlier this sum@@ mer F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws asked some experts , why W@@ in@@ ter has changed her public im@@ age in such a rad@@ ical way .
back then , the foun@@ der and C@@ E@@ O of P@@ ow@@ er@@ w@@ omen@@ T@@ V , A@@ my Pal@@ mer , sus@@ pec@@ ted that W@@ in@@ ter is experienc@@ ing a &quot; typ@@ ical H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood trans@@ for@@ mation &quot; from a child sta@@ r to an ad@@ ult .
she has been on television for ne@@ arly her whole life , and she has gro@@ wn up in the Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an er@@ a .
she has lear@@ n@@ t that the more you show b@@ are s@@ kin , the more pub@@ lic@@ ity and attention you get in H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood , Pal@@ mer said to F@@ o@@ x ne@@ ws ad@@ ding that this exactly same phen@@ omen@@ on has already been seen coun@@ t@@ less time before .
w@@ in@@ ter beg@@ an in M@@ od@@ er@@ n F@@ am@@ ily when she was only 11 years old .
the ac@@ tor has an@@ no@@ yed some of her l@@ ong@@ -@@ time f@@ ans with this change in her im@@ age .
it is not difficult to gu@@ ess , where she will be in ten years , since the do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill is already this ste@@ ep , one women stated on W@@ in@@ ter &apos;s In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m account .
some of her f@@ ans instead defend the ac@@ t@@ ress , saying that she sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t care about the cr@@ iti@@ que .
you look a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing !
it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t matter what other people say .
you are an ins@@ pi@@ ration to many women , a young w@@ oman p@@ ra@@ ises .
the Jap@@ an@@ ese pre@@ fer Fin@@ land from the Nor@@ di@@ c countries - tou@@ ris@@ ts are temp@@ ted with a@@ uro@@ ra@@ s : in the autu@@ m@@ n it is possible to see a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r a@@ uro@@ ra
the purpose of the campaign is to temp@@ t the Jap@@ an@@ ese to begin their a@@ uro@@ ra tri@@ ps already early in the autu@@ m@@ n , V@@ is@@ it Fin@@ land says in a press rele@@ ase .
the main at@@ trac@@ tions for the Jap@@ an@@ ese a@@ uro@@ ra travel are In@@ ar@@ i and L@@ ev@@ i .
the a@@ uro@@ ra bo@@ re@@ al@@ is are the main ass@@ ets for our w@@ in@@ ter travel , and they are strongly connec@@ ted with mid@@ w@@ in@@ ter and s@@ no@@ w@@ y lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ es .
there is a good demand for w@@ inter@@ y a@@ uro@@ ra tri@@ ps to L@@ ap@@ land , but now we attempt to increase the sal@@ es of autu@@ m@@ n tri@@ ps .
not many know that the a@@ uro@@ ra se@@ as@@ on beg@@ ins already early in the autu@@ m@@ n and continues until late in the s@@ pr@@ ing .
during autu@@ m@@ n it is possible to see the so@@ -@@ called mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r a@@ uro@@ ra , where the sur@@ face of a la@@ ke reflec@@ ts the a@@ uro@@ ra , thus making the vision tw@@ ice as f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic , ac@@ ting Mar@@ ket@@ ing manag@@ er A@@ nne L@@ in@@ d descri@@ b@@ es in the press rele@@ ase .
the main target group for V@@ is@@ it Fin@@ land &apos;s a@@ uro@@ ra campaign are the we@@ al@@ thy , c@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ living Jap@@ an@@ ese women between 25 and 35 years , who dre@@ am about tra@@ v@@ elling and new experi@@ ences .
they are already interested in Fin@@ land , its nature and des@@ ign .
tou@@ ris@@ ts are at@@ trac@@ ted to Fin@@ land using for example on@@ line adver@@ tis@@ ing .
res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers from A@@ al@@ to Uni@@ versity and from univers@@ ities of Tur@@ k@@ u and T@@ o@@ ky@@ o carried out a sur@@ ve@@ y , according to which Fin@@ land &apos;s country im@@ age is excep@@ tion@@ ally strong and positive among the Jap@@ an@@ ese when compared to other Nor@@ di@@ c countries .
however , the Jap@@ an@@ ese do wish for cle@@ ar@@ er uni@@ que at@@ trac@@ tions from Fin@@ land , and this is where a@@ uro@@ ra have enormous potential , according to L@@ in@@ d .
the over@@ night sta@@ ys of Jap@@ an@@ ese tou@@ ris@@ ts have gro@@ wn signific@@ antly more in Fin@@ land than in other Nor@@ di@@ c countries .
last year they over@@ ni@@ ghted in Fin@@ land over tw@@ ice more than in Sweden , Denmark or Nor@@ way .
from the point of view of F@@ inn@@ ish travel , the Jap@@ an@@ ese as a target group are interesting , because they spen@@ d over 80 million euro@@ s in Fin@@ land .
on average , the Jap@@ an@@ ese spent 18@@ 3 euro@@ s a day in Fin@@ land , says L@@ in@@ d .
Bri@@ tain sett@@ le for sil@@ ver in ru@@ g@@ by s@@ ev@@ ens after F@@ ij@@ i mas@@ ter@@ clas@@ s se@@ es them take g@@ old
great Bri@@ tain &apos;s im@@ pres@@ sive run in the Ru@@ g@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a cr@@ as@@ hing hal@@ t at the final h@@ ur@@ dle by F@@ ij@@ i in the final on Th@@ urs@@ day night when they were comprehen@@ sively be@@ a@@ ten 4@@ 3@@ -@@ 7 at the D@@ e@@ od@@ or@@ o Sta@@ di@@ um here in Ri@@ o .
F@@ ij@@ i gave a mas@@ ter@@ clas@@ s in hand@@ ling , off@@ -@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing , si@@ de@@ -@@ ste@@ pp@@ ing , support play , running lines and bru@@ te streng@@ th to w@@ in g@@ old - their first Ol@@ ymp@@ ic med@@ al of any col@@ our .
de@@ fe@@ at came with the n@@ on@@ -@@ too sha@@ b@@ by con@@ sol@@ ation of sil@@ ver - Bri@@ tain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be pro@@ ud of their efforts in the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral Ol@@ ymp@@ ic 7@@ s t@@ our@@ na@@ ment in which they be@@ at New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ar@@ gent@@ ina and South Africa along the way .
the bru@@ ising be@@ ating of the Bo@@ ks , 7@@ -@@ 5 in the sem@@ i@@ -@@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to b@@ ite them in the final .
but , regar@@ d@@ less , F@@ ij@@ i on this form would have be@@ a@@ ten a f@@ it as a f@@ iddle 15@@ -@@ man te@@ am .
it may be some con@@ sol@@ ation to G@@ B - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a g@@ old med@@ al around his nec@@ k tomorrow : F@@ ij@@ i &apos;s head co@@ ach is B@@ en R@@ y@@ an , the former Eng@@ land b@@ os@@ s from W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ on .
it has been some jour@@ ne@@ y for G@@ B .
eight years ago , under R@@ y@@ an , they lost every ga@@ me at the A@@ dela@@ ide s@@ ev@@ ens .
here , they lost just one .
this ha@@ m@@ mer@@ ing will h@@ ur@@ t but the progress is star@@ t@@ ling .
F@@ ij@@ i started ma@@ g@@ nific@@ ently , b@@ oun@@ cing off G@@ B tac@@ kl@@ es for fu@@ n .
it was like running into a series of moving bus@@ es for cap@@ tain T@@ om M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l and co and the World Ser@@ ies cha@@ mp@@ ions w@@ ent 5@@ -@@ 0 up when O@@ sea K@@ ol@@ inis@@ a@@ u di@@ ved over in the cor@@ ner .
with four minu@@ tes on the c@@ lo@@ ck j@@ er@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another down the right wing , which was conver@@ ted .
12@@ -@@ 0 and G@@ B had har@@ dly tou@@ ched the b@@ all .
a super@@ b M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l tackle sto@@ pped the man@@ -@@ moun@@ tain Le@@ one N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a from sc@@ or@@ ing a third but it was only dela@@ ying F@@ ij@@ i .
on s@@ even minu@@ tes J@@ as@@ a Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a tou@@ ched down in the right cor@@ ner and G@@ B were 17@@ -@@ 0 to the bad .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a added another from the res@@ tar@@ t and there was still over a minu@@ te on the c@@ lo@@ ck ... in the first half .
V@@ a@@ tem@@ o R@@ av@@ ou@@ vo@@ u then bur@@ st through some more lim@@ p G@@ B tac@@ kl@@ ing and stor@@ med to the line to sc@@ or@@ e .
the conver@@ sion made it 2@@ 9@@ -@@ 0 at the break .
it was as if F@@ ij@@ i had been bor@@ n to play 7@@ s , while G@@ B are still learning the trade .
which is pre@@ tty much how it is .
G@@ B made wh@@ oles@@ ale changes at hal@@ f@@ -@@ time and they plu@@ g@@ ged the F@@ ij@@ ian d@@ am ... for all of four minu@@ tes , which by fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ half standards was good , until J@@ os@@ ua Tu@@ is@@ o@@ va w@@ ent over after some bri@@ lli@@ ant F@@ ij@@ ian inter@@ play .
D@@ an Nor@@ ton gra@@ b@@ bed a try for G@@ B , tou@@ ching down in the left cor@@ ner to make it 3@@ 6@@ -@@ 7 but the ga@@ me was long gone the way of the South Se@@ a Is@@ lan@@ ders whose f@@ ans san@@ g , wa@@ ved fla@@ gs and d@@ an@@ ced in the stands .
it was hard not to ad@@ mi@@ re F@@ ij@@ i &apos;s whole jo@@ y@@ ful approach .
M@@ a@@ ta V@@ ili@@ a@@ me ic@@ ed the F@@ ij@@ ian ca@@ ke that d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t need ic@@ ing with another try in the d@@ ying mom@@ ents .
the wh@@ ist@@ le w@@ ent , the F@@ ij@@ ians emb@@ rac@@ ed and G@@ B h@@ it the tur@@ f , thorou@@ gh@@ ly be@@ a@@ ten .
earlier in the day , F@@ ij@@ i had be@@ a@@ ten Jap@@ an 20@@ -@@ 5 in their sem@@ i@@ -@@ final and G@@ B ed@@ ged South Africa in a ti@@ ght sem@@ i@@ -@@ final of one try each - Bri@@ tain &apos;s conver@@ sion the difference .
Ky@@ le Bro@@ wn put the Bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but D@@ an Nor@@ ton with some da@@ zz@@ ling foot@@ work bro@@ ke the line and s@@ co@@ red under the pos@@ ts in the second half .
a bri@@ lli@@ ant late tackle from Mar@@ c@@ us Wat@@ son , bro@@ ther of Eng@@ land &apos;s 15@@ -@@ asi@@ de te@@ am , An@@ th@@ on@@ y , secu@@ red the w@@ in - and ultimately the sil@@ ver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning ins@@ pi@@ red to ro@@ wing vic@@ tory by co@@ ach &apos;s canc@@ er b@@ attle
there will not be a more em@@ o@@ tive g@@ old at these g@@ am@@ es , and that is saying something .
from the first s@@ tro@@ ke to the last , 2@@ 20 pun@@ is@@ hing he@@ a@@ ves into history , Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning found added mean@@ ing in their g@@ ol@@ den moment at the E@@ sta@@ ci@@ o da L@@ ag@@ oa .
though they were the two pu@@ ll@@ ing on the o@@ ars , there were three vo@@ ices in that bo@@ at , the ech@@ o of co@@ ach R@@ ob@@ in W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s ever present as they pow@@ ered to a second succ@@ es@@ sive Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ old in the women &apos;s pa@@ ir@@ s , the first f@@ em@@ al@@ es in the ann@@ als of British sport to scale such a he@@ ight .
their domin@@ ance was absolu@@ te , after all this was their 3@@ 9@@ th ou@@ ting un@@ be@@ a@@ ten , again un@@ preced@@ ented .
what we see , two bri@@ lli@@ ant a@@ th@@ le@@ tes s@@ ka@@ ting over the sur@@ face with the el@@ e@@ gan@@ ce of s@@ w@@ ans , does not wh@@ oll@@ y reflect the nature of the tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
behind every ro@@ wing g@@ old is a b@@ atta@@ li@@ on of willing hands contribu@@ ting the inc@@ re@@ mental gain@@ s that make the difference , and no hands were more instru@@ mental than those of a co@@ ach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when di@@ ag@@ nos@@ ed with canc@@ er .
as he said , it was tou@@ ch and go .
I had bla@@ d@@ der canc@@ er which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they d@@ on &apos;@@ t it goes every@@ where .
it would have been a pre@@ tty bad situation .
it al@@ ters your out@@ look a bit .
W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s was di@@ ag@@ nos@@ ed in December 20@@ 13 .
the tri@@ o were for@@ tun@@ ate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 20@@ 14 out of se@@ as@@ on , keeping the dis@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in h@@ os@@ p@@ ital and I was w@@ al@@ king around the ward - 20@@ ft , 3@@ 0@@ ft 5@@ 0@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it star@@ ts off .
ro@@ wing in itself is a jour@@ ne@@ y but that makes it a bit b@@ ig@@ ger .
in the im@@ medi@@ acy of vic@@ tory their first thou@@ ghts were for W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s , who had spent a ner@@ v@@ y morning talking a little more than us@@ ual in an attempt to process his own an@@ xi@@ eties .
S@@ tan@@ ning , a cap@@ tain in the Ro@@ y@@ al arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ im@@ ent with a t@@ our of Afghanistan behind her , said &quot; I &apos;@@ ve been an em@@ o@@ tional w@@ rec@@ k this week , ma@@ y@@ be that &apos;s a bit extre@@ me , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reite@@ rates how much this means to me , how much me and Hel@@ en have worked and R@@ ob@@ in as well .
it &apos;s been a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic three years back with Hel@@ en and R@@ ob@@ in .
without R@@ ob@@ in we would be no@@ body , so a mas@@ sive thanks to him he &apos;s the best co@@ ach in the world .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have asked for a better person to tra@@ in with , or a better co@@ ach .
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ a@@ ther S@@ tan@@ ning ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t lost a ra@@ ce in five years .
the pa@@ ir set a pun@@ is@@ hing r@@ hy@@ th@@ m that their ri@@ val@@ s could never mat@@ ch .
even in the final 500 met@@ res when the cre@@ ws from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and Denmark beg@@ an to close , S@@ tan@@ ning and G@@ lo@@ ver had too much in reser@@ ve .
we were very much in the moment .
Hel@@ en was calling &apos; sta@@ y in the process , sta@@ y in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t looking to do anything a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing .

M@@ T@@ K &apos;s Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen on the for@@ est gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion : over 80 perc@@ ent of the for@@ est ow@@ ners outside
the for@@ est gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion is one of the tax changes in the next year &apos;s budget proposal by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance .
a tax d@@ educ@@ tion to the income tax law is proposed . the d@@ educ@@ tion would be granted on the basis of for@@ est proper@@ ty succ@@ ession gi@@ ft tax .
in the proposal by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance , this for@@ est gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion has four goals : to promote generation changes in for@@ est hol@@ dings , to make for@@ est ow@@ ners &quot; age structure youn@@ ger , to increase the holding siz@@ es , and to increase the w@@ ood supply .
the goal of the Minis@@ try is to promote ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ uri@@ al fores@@ try .
a for@@ est ow@@ ner would make the d@@ educ@@ tion from the pur@@ e income from for@@ est capital .
generally speaking , the idea of doing a to@@ ol such as this to promote for@@ est proper@@ ties &quot; gener@@ ational change is good , com@@ men@@ ted the For@@ es@@ try Direc@@ tor J@@ uh@@ a Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen of the Central Union of Agricul@@ tural Pro@@ duc@@ ers and For@@ est O@@ w@@ ners ( M@@ T@@ K ) .
however , Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen did find points of criticism from the tax change proposal .
the for@@ est gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion is proposed to be made from the pur@@ e capital income of the for@@ est ow@@ ner .
it is capital income from which all the other d@@ educ@@ tions have been d@@ educ@@ ted .
according to M@@ T@@ K and Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen , the effectiveness of the tax d@@ educ@@ tion would be greater , if the d@@ educ@@ tion could be made stra@@ ight from the w@@ ood sal@@ es proceed@@ s .
the starting point for the Mo@@ F proposal is that by making the d@@ educ@@ tion from the fores@@ try &apos;s pur@@ e capital income , it is possible to prevent fores@@ try capital income los@@ ses based on the d@@ educ@@ tion that then would be d@@ educ@@ ted elsewhere in taxation .
in this case a person would get a tax benefit even without sell@@ ing w@@ ood .
the cal@@ c@@ ulation model is un@@ necess@@ arily compl@@ icated .
an average for@@ est ow@@ ner is not able to pi@@ ece it together , says Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen .
in addition , he says , the model only affec@@ ts a small part of for@@ est ow@@ ners .
the proposed limit of tax d@@ educ@@ tion that is ti@@ ed to the for@@ est &apos;s prof@@ its is 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 euro@@ s .
Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen thin@@ ks this is too high .
according to him , as such it will elimin@@ ate 8@@ 2 per cent of F@@ inn@@ ish for@@ est ow@@ ners away from the reduction sp@@ here .
this model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of for@@ est ow@@ ners , he says .
Mo@@ F se@@ es the limit as supporting the goal of increasing holding siz@@ es .
according to Ha@@ k@@ k@@ ar@@ a@@ inen , for@@ est gi@@ ft d@@ educ@@ tion has been tal@@ ked about for dec@@ ad@@ es .
the reason behind it is the ag@@ ing of for@@ est ow@@ ners .
according to M@@ T@@ K , at the moment , the average age of for@@ est ow@@ ners is over 60 years , and about half of for@@ est ow@@ ners are pen@@ sioners .

F@@ inn@@ ish study can help in improving the effect of canc@@ er treat@@ ments
the new study results from res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers in Uni@@ versity of Tur@@ k@@ u can help in developing more effective canc@@ er treat@@ ments .
the obser@@ vations by Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y of Fin@@ land res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er Joh@@ ann@@ a I@@ vas@@ ka &apos;s research group show that the har@@ d@@ ness of a canc@@ er tu@@ m@@ our increas@@ es the canc@@ er mal@@ ig@@ n@@ an@@ cy .
many human t@@ issues , like bre@@ ast t@@ issue , are very so@@ ft , and the t@@ issue cell@@ s gro@@ w as us@@ ual in an environment such as this .
according to I@@ vas@@ ka , it was possible to stop the canc@@ er growth in a lab@@ or@@ atory environment by re@@ turning the t@@ issue sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing the canc@@ er to cor@@ respond to normal , so@@ ft t@@ issue .
in the future it may be possible to improve med@@ ical canc@@ er treat@@ ments &quot; effectiveness by foc@@ us@@ sing on the communication between cell@@ s and sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing t@@ issue in addition to canc@@ er cell@@ s in treat@@ ments .

both were Com@@ po@@ s men@@ ti@@ s at the time of the crime
according to the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t Court , in last July the two 17@@ -@@ year old young men kill@@ ed a man who worked as a super@@ vis@@ or at a fos@@ ter home under a re@@ for@@ ma@@ tory scho@@ ol .
according to the Court &apos;s ra@@ tion@@ ale for the sen@@ tence , the 17@@ -@@ year old who was sen@@ ten@@ ced for mur@@ der atta@@ c@@ ked the super@@ vis@@ or from behind , as this was sitting on the living room S@@ O@@ F@@ A .
the super@@ vis@@ or managed to dis@@ en@@ tan@@ g@@ le him@@ self from the hold , leading the young person to his room , when the other of young person h@@ it him with a va@@ c@@ uu@@ m cle@@ an@@ er pi@@ pe .
the super@@ vis@@ or was also str@@ ang@@ led with a cor@@ d , h@@ it , and k@@ ic@@ ked to the head .
according to the mental examin@@ ation , both of the condem@@ ned were of sound mind in the time of the crime .
according to the Court , the y@@ outh had planned an es@@ cap@@ e from the fos@@ ter home at least since the previous day .

the sea ch@@ ur@@ ns fa@@ te@@ fully , but the true ti@@ d@@ al wa@@ ve h@@ its among Mad@@ ri@@ d &apos;s cro@@ w@@ ds - the day of rec@@ k@@ on@@ ing with the past can begin .
that is the cor@@ e of the s@@ tory in P@@ ed@@ ro Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r &apos;s new@@ est .
the previous fil@@ m Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r direc@@ ted , I &apos;@@ m S@@ o ex@@ ci@@ ted ( 20@@ 13 ) , was a somewhat c@@ amp@@ y and rather racy sa@@ ti@@ r@@ ical com@@ ed@@ y , the one prec@@ eding that , The s@@ kin I live I@@ n ( 20@@ 11 ) , one of the cul@@ min@@ ations of the Spanish vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o &apos;s care@@ er .
as to its level , Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta ( 20@@ 16 ) is placed some@@ where in between those two works .
it is conven@@ tion@@ ally ser@@ ene lo@@ ve , relationship and family dra@@ ma , in the centre of which is a mo@@ ther@@ -@@ d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter relationship .
the s@@ tory is a simple one , and largely told in f@@ las@@ h@@ bac@@ ks .
life seems to be going well for the mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ aged tit@@ le charac@@ ter ( E@@ m@@ ma Su@@ ar@@ e@@ z ) , but then all threa@@ ten@@ s to fall apart .
in the wa@@ ke of a ran@@ dom en@@ counter , a new part@@ ner ( D@@ ar@@ io G@@ ran@@ d@@ in@@ et@@ ti ) is as@@ ton@@ ished all the way to the final sta@@ ges of the fil@@ m .
in the form of a f@@ las@@ h@@ back and a long letter , Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta rec@@ oun@@ ts her life s@@ tory to her grow@@ n@@ up d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter .
she beg@@ ins from the time before the d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter was bor@@ n , from the mom@@ ents she met the future fa@@ ther of the g@@ ir@@ l ( Dan@@ i@@ el G@@ ra@@ o ) .
at the same time , A@@ dra@@ ina U@@ gar@@ te , who is fam@@ ili@@ ar from the T@@ V series The T@@ ime in B@@ et@@ w@@ een ( 20@@ 13@@ -@@ 20@@ 14 ) , ris@@ es to the role of the other leading la@@ d@@ y : Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta as a young te@@ ac@@ her .
Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta &apos;s ag@@ ing has been realis@@ ed in a way that can be considered as c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y , but I myself would say that it is kind of f@@ un@@ n@@ y and li@@ ter@@ ally done in one fel@@ l s@@ w@@ o@@ o@@ p .
Ju@@ li@@ e@@ ta has long dis@@ tance to the s@@ par@@ kl@@ ing , including hu@@ m@@ our , that so often character@@ ises Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r &apos;s fil@@ ms .
it is even@@ ly ac@@ ted , com@@ posed , contain@@ ing good mu@@ si@@ c here and there , and rather mel@@ an@@ ch@@ ol@@ ic fil@@ m that has ing@@ redi@@ ents for an el@@ e@@ gy the way it is .
instead the vis@@ ual sa@@ tu@@ ration that is typ@@ ical for the Spanish direc@@ tor is still ex@@ tant , and it exists in a way it s@@ low@@ ly beg@@ ins to s@@ tic@@ k out more as a pur@@ e techn@@ ic@@ ality than a func@@ tional dra@@ matic effect .
the charac@@ ters in the fil@@ m are tes@@ ted by ill@@ n@@ esses , de@@ a@@ ths , or su@@ d@@ den los@@ ses for no particular reason , but the sur@@ face remains dec@@ or@@ ative .
this is true especially when it comes to cos@@ tu@@ mes : in the case of the titu@@ la@@ r charac@@ ter the cos@@ tu@@ mes change from one sc@@ ene to another , and the same is true for the fla@@ m@@ bo@@ y@@ ant ear@@ r@@ ings .
Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r is particular in these things , but the main thing , the set@@ -@@ up@@ s of each sc@@ ene , do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t really improve by this .
as it is mechan@@ ically repe@@ ated , the impression is deta@@ ched and sli@@ ghtly sp@@ ir@@ it@@ less .
Al@@ mod@@ ó@@ va@@ r has written the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t based on three short stor@@ ies by Al@@ ice M@@ un@@ ro , a Can@@ ad@@ ian who received the N@@ o@@ be@@ l pri@@ z@@ e for li@@ te@@ ra@@ ture in 20@@ 13 .

the government attemp@@ ts a vote tric@@ k - K@@ ans@@ an U@@ ut@@ is@@ et
there will be no new cu@@ ts , the ministers keep on saying , so that the F@@ inn@@ s Party would not completely coll@@ ap@@ se .
though there are pl@@ enty of cu@@ ts decided in s@@ pr@@ ing that are made .
there will be no new cu@@ ts .
the already decided cu@@ ts of 4 billion are enough .
this is what the Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä ( C@@ entr@@ e ) and the Minister of Fin@@ ance P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ po ( Co@@ al@@ ition ) assure before the government budget session .
this hol@@ ds true in the sense that there are no new cu@@ ts in the Mo@@ F &apos;s proposal , since the social security cu@@ ts were decided already in the spending limits session of s@@ pr@@ ing .
child benefit , national pension , basic unemployment security , and ne@@ arly all the other benefits ti@@ ed to national pension inde@@ x are being cut 0.@@ 8@@ 5 per cent .
the d@@ ura@@ tion of ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s@@ -@@ related unemployment security will shor@@ ten from 500 days to 4@@ 00 days .
the education cu@@ ts continue .
the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections are ha@@ un@@ ting
why are the ministers so eag@@ er to emphasise the very fact that there will be no new cu@@ ts on top of these ?
because next year is an election year .
the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections are in April , and they , not the p@@ oll@@ s , are the most important ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter of the elec@@ tor@@ al term .
it has been seen already before that the government parties &quot; di@@ ver@@ ging mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al election results ru@@ in the government at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here for a long time .
however , the p@@ oll@@ s show that there is a be@@ ating waiting the government party F@@ inn@@ s , even though its previous election result , 12@@ .@@ 3 per cent , was mod@@ est compared to general election .
four years ago the F@@ inn@@ s Party got 7@@ 5@@ 2 new mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , most of whom will see the cost of working in a ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ wing government realis@@ ed next s@@ pr@@ ing .
the lif@@ elin@@ e of this government of about three equ@@ al@@ -@@ sized parties h@@ ing@@ es on whether the F@@ inn@@ s party has the ner@@ ve .
now it has@@ n &apos;@@ t , but over half of the party &apos;s vo@@ ters were f@@ ed up with the government policies already during the first year .
the first sig@@ ns of the party &apos;s parliamentary group &apos;s state of tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ence have sur@@ faced .
&apos;@@ T@@ here will be no new cu@@ ts &quot; r@@ het@@ or@@ ic is used firstly to ob@@ sc@@ ure the fact that next year there will be har@@ s@@ h cu@@ ts , and secondly to so@@ f@@ ten the b@@ low that is coming to the F@@ inn@@ s Party .
major cu@@ ts in 20@@ 18 ?
in a year everything will most likely be different - if S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä &quot; s government is still standing .
the government &apos;s goal is to break the inc@@ ur@@ ring of deb@@ ts during this parliamentary term , but in P@@ et@@ ter@@ i Or@@ po &apos;s budget proposal there is 5@@ .@@ 9 billion euro@@ s more debt contrac@@ ted next year than this year .
after the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al elections , the government has two op@@ tions .
the first is to put their hands up already hal@@ f@@ way through the elec@@ tor@@ al term and to ad@@ mit that the government is unable to follow their own pro@@ gra@@ m : the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness is not bro@@ ken or even s@@ low@@ ed down .
the second is to hold on to their pro@@ gra@@ m .
that means even har@@ der cu@@ ts on top of the previous ones in the 20@@ 17 government budget session .
the budget would be forced at least close to a balance during 20@@ 18 , and then , in the s@@ pr@@ ing , it would be just accep@@ ting whatever is coming in the general elections .
with these actions , the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness will not be bro@@ ken .
it is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the in@@ deb@@ te@@ d@@ ness , no matter how much J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä attemp@@ ts to wh@@ i@@ p up a positive at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here .
the gra@@ ph@@ s presented by the State Secre@@ tary Mar@@ t@@ ti H@@ e@@ te@@ m@@ ä@@ ki in the budgetary press conference prove it in@@ dispu@@ tably :
the world economy &apos;s growth pre@@ dic@@ tions have , again and again , turned out to be over@@ ly positive , so there will be no support from international economy .
F@@ inn@@ ish national economy has not r@@ isen much since the cr@@ as@@ h in 200@@ 8 , excep@@ t tempor@@ arily during the sti@@ mu@@ lu@@ s policy in the beginning of the 20@@ 10@@ s .
during this dec@@ ade , unemployment has increased 35 per cent and is pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ed from 34 to 35 weeks on average .
unemployment now costs 3 billion euro@@ s more ann@@ u@@ ally than it did in 200@@ 8 .
the gra@@ ph@@ s presented by H@@ e@@ te@@ m@@ ä@@ ki show that the general government debt that c@@ ros@@ sed 60 per cent limit in 20@@ 14 will gro@@ w to 70 per cent hal@@ f@@ way through next dec@@ ade .
what is responsible ?
in s@@ pr@@ ing 20@@ 15 , the debt recovery proposed by the L@@ ef@@ t A@@ lli@@ ance was rejected , because it was considered to be ir@@ responsible .
next year the main@@ ten@@ ance of unemployment costs about 6 billion euro@@ s , the su@@ m that is practic@@ ally fully covered by contrac@@ ting new debt .
this is the C@@ entr@@ e Party &apos;s , the Co@@ al@@ ition Party &apos;s , and the F@@ inn@@ s Party &apos;s idea of what is responsible .
a sur@@ ve@@ y : people want to leave a lot of tasks to mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ities
three out of four thin@@ ks that organis@@ ing children &apos;s day care , y@@ outh work , and p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal education should be a mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity &apos;s responsibilities , re@@ ve@@ als a study by K@@ A@@ K@@ S - K@@ un@@ n@@ all@@ is@@ al@@ an keh@@ it@@ t@@ ä@@ mis@@ s@@ ä@@ ä@@ ti@@ ö ( The F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for M@@ un@@ ic@@ ip@@ al Development ) .
a clear majority of the people shi@@ f@@ ts the responsibility on to a single mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ity also when it comes to li@@ br@@ aries , culture , ad@@ ult education cent@@ res , super@@ vision of building , up@@ per secon@@ d@@ ary scho@@ ol education , and waste management .
as for the prov@@ in@@ ce , the cle@@ ar@@ est hop@@ ed@@ -@@ for tasks are regional land use planning , speci@@ alised health care , vo@@ ca@@ tional education , pol@@ y@@ techn@@ ics , and institutional care for men@@ tally disab@@ led .
n@@ one of tasks that are mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ities &quot; responsibilities should be trans@@ fer@@ red to the state .

S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect I@@ s C@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ iz@@ ed as A@@ sian car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at says this fil@@ ter is ins@@ pi@@ red by an@@ ime , but some obser@@ vers say it &apos;s ra@@ ci@@ ally ins@@ ens@@ itive .
with its l@@ ens to@@ ol , S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at allows some 1@@ 50 million daily users to al@@ ter reality and play with id@@ entity in ways that border on the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn y@@ our@@ self into a p@@ ine@@ app@@ le , a do@@ g or a charac@@ ter be@@ f@@ it@@ ting a Ro@@ y L@@ ic@@ h@@ ten@@ ste@@ in pain@@ ting .
the l@@ ens@@ es are b@@ l@@ un@@ t , fe@@ atu@@ re@@ -@@ war@@ ping to@@ ols that gener@@ ate more than 30 million enhan@@ ced sel@@ f@@ ies a day .
any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record .
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at l@@ ens@@ es have drawn criticism in the past with acc@@ us@@ ations that the A@@ P@@ P was promoting bla@@ ck@@ face or encouraging wh@@ i@@ tened s@@ kin ton@@ es as an ide@@ al of be@@ au@@ ty .
so when it pus@@ hed a l@@ ens to some users this week that gave them s@@ lan@@ ted e@@ yes , distor@@ ted teet@@ h and pu@@ ff@@ y che@@ e@@ ks , some critic@@ s called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture of A@@ sian people - &quot; y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face . &quot;
and they won@@ der@@ ed if these repe@@ ated contro@@ versi@@ es pointed to a larg@@ er problem that the company has with diversity .
the ne@@ ws and the ou@@ tra@@ ge w@@ ent wide on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , with reports by The ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at said it had dis@@ man@@ t@@ led the fe@@ a@@ ture .
the company offer@@ ed an explanation : the l@@ ens was me@@ ant as hom@@ age to an@@ ime charac@@ ters , not as a car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture of A@@ sian people .
but for obser@@ vers who have experienc@@ ed racism , the l@@ ens remin@@ ded them of h@@ ur@@ t@@ ful ste@@ re@@ o@@ types in action .
others ro@@ und@@ ly rejected the an@@ ime compar@@ is@@ on .
in an em@@ ai@@ l , G@@ ra@@ ce S@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Kore@@ an American ar@@ t stud@@ ent whose tw@@ eet about the p@@ ho@@ to@@ s was wid@@ ely shared , said that the l@@ ens was &quot; h@@ ur@@ t@@ ful and un@@ com@@ for@@ table to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to ar@@ gue with the side by side compar@@ is@@ on of the very gro@@ s@@ s A@@ sian car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture and the fil@@ ter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the fil@@ ter is@@ n &apos;@@ t just y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face , but y@@ ell@@ ow@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extre@@ me .
S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at is not the only company to cross these cultural tri@@ p@@ wi@@ res .
American culture seems involved in an end@@ less str@@ u@@ gg@@ le over diversity and inclu@@ sion , from cor@@ por@@ ate bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms to H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood and the dev@@ ices we all carry in our hands .
and S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &apos;s huge au@@ di@@ ence of youn@@ ger people - who are more ra@@ ci@@ ally di@@ ver@@ se than their ol@@ der coun@@ ter@@ parts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sens@@ iti@@ vity .
when one of S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at &apos;s l@@ ens@@ es cre@@ ates an im@@ age that is in@@ sul@@ ting to a us@@ er , 2@@ 5@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old K@@ ati@@ e Z@@ h@@ u said in an inter@@ view on Th@@ urs@@ day , &quot; it &apos;s much har@@ der for these types of things to go un@@ no@@ tic@@ ed like they did before . &quot;
on Th@@ urs@@ day , M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , a product manag@@ er and eng@@ ine@@ er who works for Med@@ i@@ um , decided to del@@ ete her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account and encoura@@ ged others to do the same .
in an es@@ say for Med@@ i@@ um and in a tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one inter@@ view , she said she believ@@ ed that the rac@@ e@@ -@@ related contro@@ versi@@ es reflec@@ ted a lack of diversity in h@@ ir@@ ing practices at S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at .
M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u critic@@ iz@@ ed the company &apos;s m@@ os@@ tly wh@@ ite , all@@ -@@ m@@ ale lead@@ ership and en@@ ded her es@@ say with a has@@ h@@ ta@@ g : # Del@@ e@@ te@@ S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no di@@ ver@@ se repres@@ entation of people of col@@ or on their staff to the point where they &apos;@@ re able to make decisions like this , &quot; M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , who is C@@ hin@@ es@@ e@@ -@@ American , said , &quot; or they do have some people of col@@ or who are working there , but they &apos;@@ re not on positions where they feel safe or com@@ for@@ table to speak up . &quot;
other obser@@ vers share her view , a compla@@ in@@ t that S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at has left largely un@@ answ@@ ered .
the company does not rele@@ ase figures about diversity on its staff , no@@ ting its status as a private company .
on Th@@ urs@@ day , S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at dec@@ lined to discuss the ra@@ cial back@@ grounds of its staff , but according to a spo@@ kes@@ man , the company recently hi@@ red a rec@@ ru@@ ite@@ r to focus on under@@ represented pop@@ ula@@ tions and on dri@@ ving inclu@@ sion efforts inter@@ n@@ ally .
for her part , M@@ S@@ . Z@@ h@@ u said she would keep her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account closed , ad@@ ding , &quot; I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O@@ .@@ K@@ . &quot;
military O@@ ffici@@ als distor@@ ted I@@ S@@ I@@ S I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence , C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al P@@ an@@ el says
officials from the United States Central Comm@@ and al@@ tered intell@@ ig@@ ence reports to por@@ tra@@ y a more optimis@@ tic pic@@ ture of the war against the Isla@@ mic State in Iraq and S@@ y@@ ria than events on the ground war@@ ran@@ ted , a C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al pan@@ el said in a report issu@@ ed Th@@ urs@@ day .
the inte@@ ri@@ m report , from a task force established by the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an cha@@ ir@@ men of the House Ar@@ med Ser@@ vic@@ es Committee , I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence Committee and D@@ ef@@ en@@ se appropriations S@@ ub@@ committee , found &quot; wid@@ es@@ pread dis@@ satisfac@@ tion &quot; among Central Comm@@ and intell@@ ig@@ ence analys@@ ts , who said su@@ peri@@ ors were do@@ c@@ tor@@ ing their assess@@ ments of American efforts to de@@ fe@@ at the Isla@@ mic State .
Central Comm@@ and , known as C@@ ent@@ co@@ m , is the military head@@ quar@@ ters in T@@ amp@@ a , F@@ l@@ a . , that over@@ se@@ es American military operations across the Middle East and Central A@@ sia .
&quot; intell@@ ig@@ ence products approved by sen@@ i@@ or C@@ ent@@ co@@ m leaders typ@@ ically provided a more positive de@@ pic@@ tion of U@@ .@@ S@@ . anti@@ terrorism efforts than was war@@ ran@@ ted by facts on the ground and were consisten@@ tly more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intell@@ ig@@ ence community , &quot; a ne@@ ws rele@@ ase about the report said .
&quot; what happened at C@@ ent@@ co@@ m is unacceptable - our war fi@@ gh@@ ters su@@ ffer when bad analysis is presented to sen@@ i@@ or policy ma@@ kers , &quot; said R@@ ep@@ res@@ enta@@ tive K@@ en C@@ al@@ ver@@ t , Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia .
the lead@@ ership fa@@ ilu@@ res at C@@ ent@@ co@@ m reach to the very top of the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation .
the 10@@ -@@ pa@@ ge report detailed per@@ sis@@ tent problems in 20@@ 14 and 20@@ 15 in Central Comm@@ and &apos;s descri@@ p@@ tion and analysis of American efforts to tra@@ in Iraqi forces .
although it off@@ ers no defin@@ itive evidence that sen@@ i@@ or O@@ b@@ am@@ a administration officials ord@@ ered the reports to be do@@ c@@ to@@ red , it descri@@ b@@ es analys@@ ts as feel@@ ing as though they were under pressure from C@@ ent@@ co@@ m leaders to present a more optimis@@ tic view of the threat posed by the Isla@@ mic State , also known as I@@ S@@ I@@ S or I@@ S@@ I@@ L .
&quot; throughout the first half of 20@@ 15 , many Central Comm@@ and press rele@@ ases , statements and C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ ies were signific@@ antly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a C@@ ent@@ co@@ m official stated pub@@ lic@@ ly that a major military assa@@ ult to take back Mos@@ u@@ l could begin as early as April or May 20@@ 15 .
Mos@@ u@@ l , Iraq &apos;s secon@@ d@@ -@@ larg@@ est c@@ ity , remains under the control of the Isla@@ mic State .
&quot; after months of investig@@ ation , this much is very clear , &quot; R@@ ep@@ res@@ enta@@ tive M@@ ik@@ e P@@ om@@ pe@@ o , Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an of K@@ an@@ sa@@ s , said in a statement .
from the m@@ iddle of 20@@ 14 to the m@@ iddle of 20@@ 15 , the United States Central Comm@@ and &apos;s most sen@@ i@@ or intell@@ ig@@ ence leaders man@@ ipu@@ lated the comm@@ and &apos;s intell@@ ig@@ ence products to do@@ w@@ n@@ play the threat from I@@ S@@ I@@ S in Iraq .
Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans created the task force after learning that analys@@ ts had raised concerns that intell@@ ig@@ ence about the Isla@@ mic State was being man@@ ipu@@ lated .
the report rele@@ ased Th@@ urs@@ day is to be followed up by more exten@@ sive fin@@ dings as the investig@@ ation continues .
there is an additional , on@@ going investig@@ ation of C@@ ent@@ co@@ m intell@@ ig@@ ence by the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se inspec@@ tor general .
democratic members of the House I@@ nte@@ ll@@ ig@@ ence Committee rele@@ ased their own fin@@ dings on Th@@ urs@@ day that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an task force .
&quot; between 20@@ 14 and 20@@ 15 , C@@ ent@@ co@@ m created an over@@ ly in@@ su@@ la@@ r process for producing intell@@ ig@@ ence assess@@ ments on I@@ S@@ I@@ L and Iraqi Security For@@ ces , &quot; R@@ ep@@ res@@ enta@@ tive A@@ d@@ am B@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff , the committee &apos;s top Democ@@ rat , said in a statement .
this process , M@@ r@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff said , &quot; sta@@ ll@@ ed the rele@@ ase of intell@@ ig@@ ence products , &quot; h@@ ur@@ t mor@@ ale among analys@@ ts and &quot; in@@ sufficiently ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ated dis@@ s@@ enting views . &quot;
but M@@ r@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure C@@ ent@@ co@@ m analys@@ ts to f@@ it their conclusions to a &quot; pres@@ et or political n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive . &quot;
the pre@@ l@@ imin@@ ary results of the C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al investig@@ ation were re@@ ported Tu@@ es@@ day by The D@@ a@@ ily be@@ ast .
last A@@ ug@@ ust , The New Yor@@ k T@@ imes re@@ ported the existence of the P@@ enta@@ g@@ on inspec@@ tor general investig@@ ation , open@@ ed after compla@@ ints by C@@ ent@@ co@@ m analys@@ ts .
L@@ t@@ . C@@ m@@ d@@ r@@ . Pat@@ ric@@ k E@@ van@@ s , a P@@ enta@@ g@@ on spo@@ kes@@ man , said in a statement that the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ e@@ part@@ ment would not comment on the C@@ ong@@ res@@ sion@@ al report while the inspec@@ tor general &apos;s investig@@ ation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes dis@@ agree on the interpre@@ tation of complex data , and the intell@@ ig@@ ence community and D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se welcome heal@@ thy dialogue on these vital national security to@@ pic@@ s . &quot;
the investig@@ ation has re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions beyond the question of whether the Americ@@ an@@ -@@ led bom@@ b@@ ing campaign in Iraq and S@@ y@@ ria is succ@@ eed@@ ing ( an as@@ ser@@ tion now made by a growing number of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se officials ) .
but last year &apos;s all@@ eg@@ ations called into question how much President O@@ b@@ am@@ a could rely on Central Comm@@ and for hon@@ est assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Li@@ by@@ a and other crisis spo@@ ts .
the cr@@ iti@@ qu@@ es on the Isla@@ mic State intell@@ ig@@ ence mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r dispu@@ tes of more than a dec@@ ade ago , when a C@@ ent@@ co@@ m intell@@ ig@@ ence analys@@ t , G@@ reg@@ ory H@@ o@@ ok@@ er , w@@ ro@@ te a research paper saying that the administration of President Geor@@ ge W@@ . Bush , over many analys@@ ts &quot; objec@@ tions , advoc@@ ated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 in@@ va@@ sion .
M@@ r@@ . H@@ o@@ ok@@ er also played a key part in the in@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion over the Isla@@ mic State intell@@ ig@@ ence .
last year , officials said , M@@ r@@ . H@@ o@@ ok@@ er &apos;s te@@ am concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , air@@ strik@@ es against Isla@@ mic Sta@@ te@@ -@@ held re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies had not signific@@ antly wea@@ ken@@ ed the terrorist group &apos;s finan@@ ces because it had buil@@ t ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies to sel@@ l oil on the b@@ lack market .
but the finding was not distribu@@ ted outside Central Comm@@ and , The T@@ imes re@@ ported in September .
C@@ ent@@ co@@ m &apos;s com@@ man@@ der then , Gen@@ . L@@ lo@@ y@@ d J@@ . Aus@@ tin I@@ II , came under criticism last year after S@@ en@@ ate tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ y vie@@ wed by many law@@ ma@@ kers as being an over@@ ly positive assessment of the war .
general Aus@@ tin re@@ ti@@ red in April and was re@@ placed at Central Comm@@ and by Gen@@ . J@@ os@@ ep@@ h l@@ . V@@ o@@ te@@ l .
U@@ .@@ S@@ . w@@ ins 4@@ th S@@ tra@@ ight in W@@ omen &apos;s field ho@@ c@@ key , setting U@@ p show@@ down W@@ it@@ h Bri@@ tain
one day after sc@@ or@@ ing three goals in a 6@@ -@@ 1 vic@@ tory over Jap@@ an , K@@ ati@@ e B@@ am s@@ co@@ red the first two goals for the United States women &apos;s field ho@@ c@@ key te@@ am on Th@@ urs@@ day as the Americ@@ ans de@@ fe@@ ated In@@ dia , 3@@ -@@ 0 .
five goals in two g@@ am@@ es should be a m@@ em@@ or@@ able fe@@ at , but B@@ am , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; I have no c@@ lu@@ e , &quot; she said .
I &apos;@@ m not really one of those people who ke@@ ep@@ s tra@@ ck of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americ@@ ans are 4@@ -@@ 0 in the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic t@@ our@@ na@@ ment and are ti@@ ed for first place in their group with Bri@@ tain , which remain@@ ed un@@ be@@ a@@ ten after de@@ fe@@ ating Jap@@ an , 2@@ -@@ 0 , on Th@@ urs@@ day .
Bri@@ tain and the United States will meet on Sa@@ tur@@ day in the last ga@@ me of the first round .
both te@@ am@@ s have qualified for the quar@@ ter fin@@ als , and the ga@@ me will decide who fin@@ is@@ hes first in their si@@ x@@ -@@ te@@ am b@@ rac@@ ket and who fin@@ is@@ hes second .
the fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ place fin@@ is@@ her will avoid the power@@ ful D@@ ut@@ ch , the leaders of the other b@@ rac@@ ket , for a bit longer when the quar@@ ter fin@@ als begin .
however Sa@@ tur@@ day &apos;s ga@@ me tur@@ ns out , the Americ@@ ans have created a sti@@ r with their surpris@@ ing run here , four years after fin@@ is@@ hing last among 12 te@@ am@@ s at the L@@ on@@ d@@ on G@@ am@@ es .
B@@ am was on that te@@ am .
she gre@@ w up in B@@ lu@@ e bel@@ l , P@@ a . , first pic@@ ked up a field ho@@ c@@ key s@@ tic@@ k when she was 3 ( her tw@@ in ol@@ der sis@@ ters played the sport at D@@ re@@ x@@ el ) and join@@ ed the national te@@ am when she was 16 , becoming its youn@@ g@@ est pla@@ yer ever .
she mis@@ sed out on the 200@@ 8 Ol@@ ymp@@ ics when she did not make the cut for the final ros@@ ter .
then came 20@@ 12 , when nothing much w@@ ent right for her and her te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes .
the next year , C@@ ra@@ i@@ g Par@@ n@@ ha@@ m , an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man , was na@@ med the co@@ ach , and things beg@@ an to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the work rate in L@@ on@@ d@@ on that we have now .
we &apos;@@ ve made a complete tur@@ n@@ around .
on Th@@ urs@@ day night , B@@ am open@@ ed the sc@@ or@@ ing in the first half with a back@@ hand sho@@ t from close in .
In@@ dia had come into the ga@@ me without a vic@@ tory in the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment , but the te@@ am proved surpris@@ ingly tou@@ gh and kept the sc@@ or@@ e 1@@ -@@ 0 until late in the third period , when B@@ am took charge .
she made a long run with the b@@ all down the left side of the field , then cur@@ led into the m@@ iddle and wh@@ ip@@ p@@ ed the b@@ all into the goal to give the Americ@@ ans a 2@@ -@@ 0 lead .
M@@ el@@ is@@ sa G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z added the final goal mid@@ way through the four@@ th period .
the s@@ hu@@ t@@ out was the first of the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment for the United States go@@ ali@@ e , J@@ ac@@ ki@@ e Bri@@ gg@@ s , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three vic@@ tor@@ ies .
she is on a ro@@ l@@ l .
so is B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re in a good place right now , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ha@@ m said , but just how good it is will depen@@ d on the result of Sa@@ tur@@ day &apos;s ga@@ me .
a@@ mid the fur@@ y of the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics , the Z@@ en of the Tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine
wh@@ er@@ ever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics .
the events in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ eir@@ o feel constan@@ t and in@@ es@@ capable , a fu@@ ri@@ ous rela@@ y of competition and s@@ tri@@ ving .
it is as if the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself were a fla@@ ming b@@ aton , passed from Ar@@ ch@@ er to s@@ w@@ im@@ mer to g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast to tri@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;@@ t turn on a television , read a new@@ s@@ paper or lis@@ ten in on your neigh@@ b@@ or &apos;s conver@@ sa@@ tion in a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e@@ -@@ sho@@ p line without hear@@ ing about S@@ im@@ one B@@ il@@ es , K@@ ati@@ e L@@ ed@@ ec@@ ky or the fe@@ ud between M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ help@@ s and C@@ had le C@@ lo@@ s .
and then there is L@@ og@@ an D@@ o@@ ole@@ y .
M@@ r@@ . D@@ o@@ ole@@ y , a fir@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ time Ol@@ ymp@@ ian and a d@@ impl@@ ed hear@@ t@@ th@@ ro@@ b in the making , may well be among those hou@@ se@@ hold na@@ mes being show@@ c@@ ased in pr@@ ime time , bu@@ o@@ yed by s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ships and feel@@ -@@ good T@@ V commer@@ ci@@ als , if he were a s@@ w@@ im@@ mer , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or even a f@@ enc@@ er .
but M@@ r@@ . D@@ o@@ ole@@ y , 28 , of La@@ ke For@@ est , C@@ al@@ if . , is compet@@ ing for the g@@ old in Ol@@ ymp@@ ic tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic fla@@ me does not ill@@ u@@ min@@ ate each event equally .
further from the cen@@ ter , partly in sha@@ do@@ w , are those s@@ ports not univers@@ ally acknowled@@ ged : air@@ -@@ p@@ is@@ to@@ l sho@@ ot@@ ing , ar@@ ch@@ ery , b@@ ad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ e@@ k@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the b@@ reas@@ t@@ s@@ tro@@ ke , and long may it re@@ ign .
but if I may make a mod@@ est case for my particular fav@@ or@@ ite , let me call attention to the dis@@ cre@@ et char@@ m of the tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
though tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine has been an Ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it deb@@ u@@ ted at the S@@ yd@@ ne@@ y G@@ am@@ es , it has spent the interven@@ ing 16 years so bar@@ ely acknowled@@ ged that many I sur@@ ve@@ yed did not re@@ ali@@ z@@ e it was an Ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignor@@ ance .
despite sen@@ ding a@@ th@@ le@@ tes to compet@@ e , the United States has never w@@ on a med@@ al in tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine and did not have an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete advan@@ ce to the fin@@ als until 20@@ 12 .
the C@@ hin@@ ese and the Rus@@ si@@ ans ten@@ d to sp@@ li@@ t the pri@@ z@@ es for the men , and the C@@ hin@@ ese and the Can@@ ad@@ ians for the women .
d@@ ong d@@ ong of China and Ro@@ si@@ e Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an of Can@@ ad@@ a will be def@@ en@@ ding their L@@ on@@ d@@ on g@@ old med@@ als this year .
but there is an under@@ do@@ g char@@ m to tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , in part because it s@@ oun@@ ds , to the un@@ en@@ li@@ gh@@ tened e@@ ar , f@@ itte@@ r for c@@ lo@@ wn coll@@ e@@ ge than the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics .
here I should conf@@ ess that I am no exper@@ t , just an ear@@ th@@ b@@ ound en@@ thu@@ si@@ ast .
it does have com@@ ic potential - the car@@ to@@ on qu@@ a@@ ver of its ne@@ ver@@ -@@ en@@ ding b@@ oun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ ce of g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ tics and di@@ ving , the two s@@ ports it essentially comb@@ ines .
the word &quot; tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine &quot; der@@ iv@@ es from the Spanish el tra@@ m@@ pol@@ í@@ n , mean@@ ing &quot; di@@ ving board . &quot;
as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing cha@@ mp@@ ions j@@ um@@ p on a gi@@ ant tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , sho@@ ot@@ ing up to ne@@ arly 30 fe@@ et in the air , and are called upon to per@@ form a series of tu@@ m@@ b@@ ling mo@@ ves ( tw@@ ists , p@@ ik@@ es and s@@ om@@ er@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts ) before even@@ tually lan@@ ding on their fe@@ et .
they are jud@@ ged on execu@@ tion , difficul@@ ty and &quot; f@@ light time , &quot; according to the official Ol@@ ymp@@ ic pro@@ gra@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ two a@@ th@@ le@@ tes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compet@@ e in Ri@@ o .
the most common Ol@@ ymp@@ ic v@@ ec@@ tor is stra@@ ight ahead .
med@@ al hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ s must go f@@ ar@@ ther , fas@@ ter , up and over , in their ques@@ t for g@@ old , sometimes to the fin@@ ish , other times back and for@@ th up and down the court .
they are ch@@ as@@ ing not only the fin@@ ish line or the starting w@@ all but also , in the tel@@ ev@@ ised cover@@ age , another ta@@ un@@ ting line : that of the world , or Ol@@ ymp@@ ic , record .
this sing@@ le@@ -@@ min@@ ded pursu@@ it is no@@ ble , ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble , even f@@ an@@ atic - and it is enough to bring even a spec@@ ta@@ tor to te@@ ars .
but it is also what I find sli@@ ghtly ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ting about even w@@ at@@ ching the G@@ am@@ es .
from this , tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine off@@ ers a res@@ pite .
the tra@@ m@@ pol@@ in@@ er &apos;s v@@ ec@@ tor is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she re@@ b@@ oun@@ ds , seem@@ ing w@@ ei@@ gh@@ t@@ less as an as@@ tr@@ on@@ a@@ ut , going up , then down , then ef@@ for@@ t@@ less@@ ly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficul@@ ty , but for the d@@ ura@@ tion of a rou@@ tin@@ e , there is no fran@@ tic charge to@@ ward the end , no va@@ ul@@ ting into the dis@@ tance , just the dre@@ am@@ y , gra@@ ce@@ ful sus@@ pension of time and gra@@ vity .
it is as close to Z@@ en as Ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition gets .

in the mid@@ st of Ol@@ ymp@@ ic man@@ ia , they promis@@ e a qu@@ i@@ et , lo@@ vely moment , one likely to be over@@ lo@@ ok@@ ed in the general mel@@ ee .

American military and intell@@ ig@@ ence services work closely with the E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians to combat terrorist thre@@ ats across the region , especially in S@@ om@@ al@@ ia , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much W@@ estern aid .
E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s economy has been ex@@ pan@@ ding at an im@@ pres@@ sive c@@ li@@ p .
its infrastructure has improved d@@ ras@@ tically - there is even a new com@@ mu@@ ter tra@@ in in the capital , A@@ d@@ d@@ is A@@ b@@ ab@@ a .
and its stre@@ ets are typ@@ ically qu@@ i@@ et , safe and cle@@ an .
though E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia has har@@ dly been a par@@ ag@@ on of democracy - human rights groups have constantly ci@@ ted the government &apos;s repres@@ si@@ veness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dis@@ sid@@ ents effectively sil@@ enc@@ ed .
many have been ex@@ iled , ja@@ iled , kill@@ ed or dri@@ ven to the far reac@@ hes of the deser@@ t .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ate people and they d@@ on &apos;@@ t have any other op@@ tions but to prote@@ st , it brea@@ ks out , &quot; said Se@@ y@@ ou@@ m T@@ es@@ home , a uni@@ versity lec@@ tu@@ re@@ r in central E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
the whole y@@ outh is prote@@ s@@ ting .
a generation is prote@@ s@@ ting .
the compla@@ ints are many , cover@@ ing everything from land use to the govern@@ ing co@@ al@@ ition &apos;s str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold on power .
after a wid@@ ely critic@@ iz@@ ed election last year , the govern@@ ing party and its all@@ ies got the last se@@ at the opposition had held and now control 100 perc@@ ent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions are ris@@ ing along the border with E@@ r@@ it@@ re@@ a ; a b@@ attle along that j@@ ag@@ ged , dispu@@ ted line claim@@ ed hund@@ re@@ ds of lives in June .
analys@@ ts fear that separ@@ at@@ ist groups that had been more or less van@@ qu@@ ished in recent years , like the O@@ ro@@ m@@ o Liber@@ ation F@@ ron@@ t or the O@@ g@@ ad@@ en N@@ ational Liber@@ ation F@@ ron@@ t , may try to explo@@ it the tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ence and re@@ arm .
several factors explain why b@@ itte@@ r feel@@ ings , after years of si@@ m@@ mer@@ ing bene@@ ath the sur@@ face , are explo@@ ding now .
the first is seem@@ ingly inno@@ cu@@ ous : s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es .
only in the last cou@@ ple of years have large num@@ bers of E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians been able to commun@@ icate using social media as che@@ aper s@@ mar@@ t@@ p@@ hon@@ es bec@@ a@@ me common and inter@@ net service improved .
even when the government s@@ hu@@ ts down access to F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok and T@@ wit@@ ter , as it frequ@@ ently does , especially during prote@@ s@@ ts , many people are still able to commun@@ icate via inter@@ net pro@@ x@@ ies that m@@ ask where they are .
several young E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians said this was how they ga@@ ther@@ ed for prote@@ s@@ ts .
second , there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as , E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s two larg@@ est ethnic groups .
O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural all@@ ies .
for e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as from E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s pre@@ domin@@ antly Christian hi@@ gh@@ lands f@@ lou@@ ris@@ hed in politics and business , explo@@ iting the O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s , many of whom are Mus@@ li@@ m and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordin@@ ate under one um@@ bre@@ lla , &quot; said M@@ ula@@ t@@ u G@@ em@@ ech@@ u , an O@@ ro@@ m@@ o lead@@ er .
the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est prote@@ s@@ ts have been in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ m@@ o areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mo@@ s feel E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia is un@@ fair@@ ly domin@@ ated by members of the Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ an ethnic group , which makes up about 6 perc@@ ent of the population and domin@@ ates the military , the intell@@ ig@@ ence services , commer@@ ce and politics .
the third reason behind the un@@ rest is the los@@ s of M@@ el@@ es Z@@ en@@ aw@@ i .
M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es , a former re@@ be@@ l lead@@ er , was E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s pr@@ ime minis@@ ter for 17 years , until his death from an und@@ is@@ closed ill@@ ness in 20@@ 12 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ i@@ us , a man who could see around cor@@ ners .
analys@@ ts say he was especially ad@@ ep@@ t at de@@ te@@ c@@ ting early sig@@ n@@ als of dis@@ content and using emis@@ s@@ aries to mas@@ sa@@ ge and def@@ an@@ g op@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; the current regime la@@ cks that ground sa@@ v@@ v@@ y , &quot; M@@ r@@ . A@@ b@@ di , the conflict analys@@ t , said .
E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new pr@@ ime minis@@ ter , Ha@@ il@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ am D@@ es@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was plu@@ c@@ ked from rela@@ tive ob@@ s@@ cur@@ ity to f@@ ill M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es &apos;s sho@@ es .
un@@ like M@@ r@@ . M@@ el@@ es , who came from the Ti@@ gra@@ y region of nor@@ thern E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , M@@ r@@ . Ha@@ il@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ am is a sou@@ ther@@ ner .
analys@@ ts say he does not have the trust of the Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ an@@ -@@ controll@@ ed security services .
the result , many fear , is more blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ed .
the last time E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia experienc@@ ed such tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands prote@@ s@@ ted over what analys@@ ts have said appe@@ ared to be an election the government b@@ un@@ g@@ led and then st@@ ole .
in the en@@ su@@ ing c@@ rac@@ k@@ down , many prote@@ s@@ ters were kill@@ ed , though fe@@ wer than in recent months , and that period of un@@ rest passed rela@@ tively quickly .
development experts have p@@ raised E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s leaders for visi@@ on@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new com@@ mu@@ ter tra@@ in , and me@@ as@@ ura@@ ble str@@ id@@ es in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not sto@@ pped the internal res@@ ent@@ ment of E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s government from inten@@ si@@ fying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic sha@@ pe .
last month , prote@@ s@@ ters in G@@ on@@ d@@ ar , an Am@@ har@@ a to@@ wn , atta@@ c@@ ked businesses ow@@ ned by Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ ans , and anti@@ -@@ Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ an ha@@ t@@ red is becoming more common in social media .
analys@@ ts say the prote@@ s@@ ts are putting the United States and other W@@ estern all@@ ies in an aw@@ k@@ ward position .
the American government has used E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia as a base for d@@ r@@ one f@@ li@@ ghts over neigh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ om@@ al@@ ia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the W@@ est clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already vol@@ ati@@ le region to cr@@ um@@ ble .
&quot; that , &quot; M@@ r@@ . A@@ b@@ di said , &quot; is a very ti@@ ght ro@@ pe to w@@ al@@ k . &quot;
D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p expla@@ ins H@@ is O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ F@@ oun@@ d@@ ed@@ -@@ I@@ S@@ I@@ S claim as &quot; s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
D@@ on@@ al@@ d J@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tried to qu@@ as@@ h the latest contro@@ vers@@ y eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing his campaign on F@@ rid@@ ay by claim@@ ing that he was not serious when he ins@@ is@@ ted several times this week that President O@@ b@@ am@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton were the &quot; foun@@ ders &quot; of the Isla@@ mic State terrorist group .
the clari@@ fication raised new questions about the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an presid@@ ential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e &apos;s ability to commun@@ icate clearly to the American public .
it also put his sur@@ ro@@ ga@@ tes , who have stra@@ ined to defend him during a tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous stre@@ t@@ ch , in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the sugges@@ tion at a r@@ ally on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day night , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p doub@@ led down on the as@@ ser@@ tion on Th@@ urs@@ day , ins@@ is@@ ting in inter@@ views that he really did intend to say that the presid@@ ent and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton had created I@@ S@@ I@@ S .
but in an ear@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ morning T@@ wit@@ ter post on F@@ rid@@ ay , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p said that he was just being s@@ ar@@ cas@@ tic .
the post was a re@@ vers@@ al from just a day ago , when M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p said in a number of inter@@ views that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the con@@ serva@@ tive radi@@ o h@@ ost Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t tried to help M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p so@@ f@@ ten the re@@ mark by remin@@ ding him that M@@ r@@ . O@@ b@@ am@@ a wants to destro@@ y I@@ S@@ I@@ S , the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an presid@@ ential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e would not have it .
the latest fi@@ restor@@ m comes as M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has been trying to ref@@ oc@@ us his campaign on the economy a@@ mid dec@@ lin@@ ing pol@@ l num@@ bers .
M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton gave du@@ el@@ ing economic speec@@ hes in M@@ ic@@ hi@@ g@@ an this week .
on F@@ rid@@ ay , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to T@@ wit@@ ter , he war@@ ned that M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech bor@@ ing .
M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has used the s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m D@@ ef@@ en@@ se before .
in late July , after he dre@@ w wid@@ es@@ pread criticism by appe@@ aring to suggest that the Rus@@ si@@ ans should ha@@ ck M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s em@@ a@@ ils , he later expla@@ ined his remarks by saying , &quot; O@@ f course I &apos;@@ m being s@@ ar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
the approach allows M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p to pus@@ h the limits of political speech and di@@ al it back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s a pat@@ tern of him tes@@ ting certain messa@@ ges that res@@ on@@ ate with his f@@ ans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clari@@ fying &quot; one way or another depen@@ ding on the re@@ action , &quot; said Ru@@ th S@@ her@@ man , a commun@@ ications exper@@ t who has been monitoring the language used by both candid@@ ates .
but I also think he &apos;s cle@@ ver about his statements and knows they are va@@ gue enough to be fil@@ tered through various l@@ ens@@ es .
instead of ton@@ ing things down for a general election au@@ di@@ ence , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p has taken an even more ca@@ us@@ tic t@@ one in recent days as his pol@@ l num@@ bers have continued to tu@@ m@@ ble .
a new N@@ B@@ C / W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal / Mar@@ ist pol@@ l rele@@ ased on F@@ rid@@ ay show@@ ed M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tra@@ il@@ ing M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton by large mar@@ g@@ ins in North Car@@ ol@@ ina , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia and C@@ ol@@ or@@ ad@@ o and loc@@ ked in a ti@@ ght ra@@ ce in F@@ lor@@ ida .
while M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p generally tries to avoid a@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ z@@ ing for pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive things that he says , he often acc@@ uses his critic@@ s of mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ing his words or mis@@ understanding his sense of hu@@ m@@ or .
but as he fac@@ es he@@ i@@ gh@@ tened scru@@ tin@@ y during the final months of the presid@@ ential campaign , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s jo@@ kes have put his lo@@ y@@ al all@@ ies in the un@@ com@@ for@@ table position of having to pub@@ lic@@ ly stand up for him no matter how pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive his remarks .
R@@ ud@@ ol@@ p@@ h W@@ . G@@ i@@ u@@ li@@ ani , the former New Yor@@ k C@@ ity ma@@ y@@ or who is one of M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s most pro@@ min@@ ent sur@@ ro@@ ga@@ tes , w@@ ent to great l@@ eng@@ ths to defend the candidate in an inter@@ view with C@@ N@@ N on Th@@ urs@@ day .
&quot; I think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political com@@ mentary , &quot; M@@ r@@ . G@@ i@@ u@@ li@@ ani said when ques@@ tioned about the ver@@ ac@@ ity of M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s as@@ ser@@ tion about M@@ r@@ . O@@ b@@ am@@ a and M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton having foun@@ ded the Isla@@ mic State .
it is true in a sense that before O@@ b@@ am@@ a , I@@ S@@ I@@ S was an almost un@@ known , small little Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation , he who called it the ja@@ y@@ ve@@ e , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he with@@ dre@@ w the tro@@ op@@ s from Iraq .
most ma@@ ins@@ tre@@ am Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the O@@ b@@ am@@ a administration , in which M@@ r@@ s@@ . C@@ lin@@ ton ser@@ ved as secre@@ tary of state , allowed I@@ S@@ I@@ S to f@@ es@@ ter by fail@@ ing to ag@@ g@@ res@@ sively manage the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of r@@ all@@ ies in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia on F@@ rid@@ ay , M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p continued to las@@ h out on T@@ wit@@ ter at the ne@@ ws media for har@@ ping on his every word and for being bi@@ ased against him .
he mo@@ c@@ ked the &quot; poor , pa@@ the@@ tic &quot; television pun@@ d@@ its who try to figure him out and said , &quot; T@@ he@@ y can &apos;@@ t ! &quot;
some Democrats s@@ co@@ ff@@ ed at M@@ r@@ . tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s exc@@ use as more evidence that he is un@@ f@@ it to be presid@@ ent .
once pr@@ ic@@ ed O@@ ut , a C@@ af@@ e re@@ tur@@ ns in Gre@@ en@@ point
ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e was a sha@@ b@@ by , c@@ ash@@ -@@ only space in W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s@@ burg that had no W@@ i@@ -@@ F@@ i but ser@@ ved good co@@ ff@@ ee for 15 years .
naturally , it got pr@@ ic@@ ed out of its B@@ ed@@ for@@ d a@@ ven@@ ue sto@@ ref@@ ron@@ t .
the stor@@ e that re@@ placed the ver@@ b in the sum@@ mer of 20@@ 14 , so@@ a@@ p C@@ her@@ i@@ e , sell@@ s so@@ ap@@ s in the sha@@ pe of c@@ up@@ ca@@ kes .
loc@@ als b@@ em@@ o@@ an@@ ed it as the latest los@@ s in a gent@@ ri@@ fying c@@ ity .
the ar@@ tis@@ t M@@ oll@@ y C@@ ra@@ b@@ app@@ le w@@ ro@@ te on T@@ wit@@ ter , &quot; New Yor@@ k is change , I know , but still , can &apos;@@ t believe C@@ B@@ G@@ B &apos;s is de@@ ad and the C@@ hel@@ sea H@@ o@@ te@@ l is gu@@ t@@ ted and ver@@ b is now a so@@ a@@ p sho@@ p . &quot;
but if New Yor@@ k is change , it is also re@@ in@@ vention .
a re@@ vi@@ ved ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e open@@ ed last November in Gre@@ en@@ point , less than a mil@@ e nor@@ th of the original loc@@ ation .
the new ver@@ b has W@@ i@@ -@@ F@@ i and accep@@ ts cre@@ dit c@@ ards but has some of the same employees and a similar un@@ pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous vi@@ be .
the co@@ ff@@ ee is still good , too .
leading the new ver@@ b is C@@ is@@ co R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z , a l@@ ong@@ time employe@@ e at the old CA@@ F@@ E who is an ow@@ ner and the general manag@@ er at the new place .
he started at ver@@ b in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a custom@@ er offer@@ ed to ban@@ k@@ ro@@ l@@ l him in a new out@@ post , he said he was ex@@ ci@@ ted to do it .
M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
ver@@ b uses the same distribu@@ tor for the b@@ ag@@ els and b@@ ought the same model of es@@ pres@@ so ma@@ ch@@ ine .
it even re@@ used the li@@ ghts from the old ver@@ b .
but M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he also wanted to exper@@ im@@ ent .
he introduced new ing@@ redi@@ ents .
B@@ ac@@ on@@ -@@ eg@@ g@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ che@@ ese san@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ hes are on the men@@ u , and to@@ pp@@ ings like ca@@ per@@ s and sa@@ ut@@ é@@ ed on@@ ions are available .
there are bro@@ w@@ n@@ -@@ ric@@ e b@@ ow@@ ls .
the CA@@ F@@ E no longer ser@@ ves be@@ er but now makes f@@ res@@ h ju@@ ices .
n@@ ine months in , M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he had no@@ tic@@ ed a ste@@ ad@@ y stre@@ am of old reg@@ ul@@ ars .
&quot; a lot of former custom@@ ers got pr@@ ic@@ ed out of W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s@@ burg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent S@@ und@@ ay , Re@@ bec@@ c@@ a O@@ li@@ ve@@ ir@@ a was one such custom@@ er .
M@@ S@@ . O@@ li@@ ve@@ ir@@ a , 34 , used to live in W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s@@ burg and w@@ ent to ver@@ b frequ@@ ently .
even after she mo@@ ved to Gre@@ en@@ point , she would still make the tre@@ k .
after ver@@ b closed , she said , she gave up d@@ rin@@ king co@@ ff@@ ee for a while .
&quot; I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed it was the co@@ ff@@ ee and the culture at ver@@ b that I lik@@ ed , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on co@@ ff@@ ee , although that day , instead of her us@@ ual ic@@ ed co@@ ff@@ ee , she w@@ ent with a b@@ len@@ ded cha@@ i d@@ rin@@ k , another new addition .
T@@ om R@@ os@@ en@@ th@@ al , another l@@ ong@@ time custom@@ er , w@@ ent fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully to ver@@ b starting in 2003 .
he &apos;@@ d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quar@@ ter past s@@ even , every day , like c@@ loc@@ k@@ work , I &apos;@@ d come in and they were making my everything b@@ ag@@ el with bu@@ tter , &quot; he said .
p@@ ho@@ to M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he wanted to exper@@ im@@ ent and introduced new ing@@ redi@@ ents to the men@@ u .
these days , M@@ r@@ . R@@ os@@ en@@ th@@ al still gets his regula@@ r order , but sometimes he &apos;@@ l@@ l s@@ wit@@ ch things up with the bac@@ on , eg@@ g and che@@ ese on an everything b@@ ag@@ el .
M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he had no hard feel@@ ings about the so@@ a@@ p sho@@ p taking over the old space .
in fact , the so@@ a@@ p C@@ her@@ i@@ e ow@@ ners offer@@ ed to make special so@@ a@@ p for ver@@ b , using the CA@@ F@@ E &apos;s col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed co@@ ff@@ ee as an ing@@ redi@@ ent .
&quot; I think we still might take them up on it , &quot; M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said .
and Gre@@ en@@ point &apos;s traditional Pol@@ ish resid@@ ents have emb@@ rac@@ ed the CA@@ F@@ E as well .
one of these new custom@@ ers trans@@ lated the men@@ u into Pol@@ ish , and M@@ r@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he planned to find a spo@@ t to dis@@ play it soon to make his new neigh@@ b@@ ors feel welcome .
the new loc@@ ation has other per@@ ks .
a local ju@@ ice spo@@ t wants to b@@ ot@@ t@@ le and sel@@ l the col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed co@@ ff@@ ee .
there is a chance the CA@@ F@@ E will ex@@ p@@ and into an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent building .
for many custom@@ ers , a new ver@@ b to get their old fav@@ or@@ ite@@ s is enough .
J@@ os@@ ep@@ h Wh@@ it@@ t was a regula@@ r and said he was hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken when they closed .
when the new space open@@ ed , M@@ r@@ . Wh@@ it@@ t said , w@@ al@@ king in and getting a co@@ ff@@ ee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ om@@ ing .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve needed to sm@@ el@@ l that , &quot; he said .

J@@ e@@ wish fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker s@@ la@@ ms Berl@@ in ho@@ te@@ l for remo@@ ving Israel di@@ al cod@@ e after Ara@@ b &quot; request &quot; - R@@ T Ne@@ ws
a French fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker of J@@ e@@ wish origin un@@ le@@ as@@ hed a media f@@ uro@@ r after he re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l ho@@ te@@ l in Berl@@ in does not list Israel &apos;s di@@ al cod@@ e , with employe@@ e c@@ iting &quot; requests &quot; from Ara@@ b@@ ic custom@@ ers .
C@@ la@@ ude Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n , an auth@@ or of H@@ ol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust docu@@ mentary &quot; S@@ ho@@ a@@ h , &quot; ven@@ ted his f@@ r@@ ustra@@ tion at the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l H@@ o@@ te@@ l in Berl@@ in , wr@@ iting an open letter in the German out@@ let F@@ A@@ Z .
during his recent sta@@ y , Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n tried to find Israel in the list of di@@ al cod@@ es provided by the ho@@ te@@ l .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 20@@ 16 in Berl@@ in , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was elimin@@ ated and er@@ ad@@ icated ?
Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n w@@ ro@@ te .
instead , K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki B@@ ris@@ to@@ l off@@ ers an opportunity to di@@ al Israel via an own call cen@@ ter .
seeking explanation , the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker addressed the issue at the ho@@ te@@ l &apos;s rec@@ ep@@ tion .
the answer he got there , Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n w@@ ro@@ te &quot; sho@@ c@@ ked him . &quot;
the ho@@ te@@ l &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k said that the measure was &quot; a deliber@@ ate decision by the management of K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki@@ -@@ H@@ o@@ tel@@ s . &quot;
the reason behind the move tri@@ gg@@ ered even more ou@@ tra@@ ge by the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker .
&quot; the majority of our gu@@ es@@ ts are Ara@@ bs and they deman@@ ded Israel &apos;s cod@@ e to be del@@ e@@ ted , &quot; the employe@@ e was quo@@ ted as saying by Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n .
Israeli amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or to Germany Y@@ a@@ ko@@ v H@@ ad@@ as@@ -@@ H@@ an@@ del@@ sman called the case a &quot; great sha@@ me , &quot; S@@ ud@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Z@@ e@@ it@@ un@@ g reports .
we were app@@ all@@ ed and sho@@ c@@ ked by the inc@@ ident .
it is in itself a great sha@@ me .
the fact that it has oc@@ cur@@ red in Germany and at that very ho@@ te@@ l cha@@ in , is an even greater dis@@ gra@@ ce .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the ho@@ te@@ l dra@@ ws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the inc@@ ident tri@@ gg@@ ered quite a response on@@ line , with people calling it a s@@ cand@@ al .
some all@@ eg@@ ed that the K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki ho@@ te@@ l simply &quot; ca@@ ved in &quot; to the all@@ eg@@ ed demands of Ara@@ b@@ ic custom@@ ers .
&quot; sha@@ me on you , &quot; another post stated , poin@@ ting out that the ho@@ te@@ l , loc@@ ated in the no@@ ble K@@ ur@@ fur@@ s@@ ten@@ d@@ am@@ m stre@@ et stands ne@@ ar a S@@ yn@@ ago@@ gue .
the ho@@ te@@ l itself was quic@@ k to br@@ us@@ h off any acc@@ us@@ ations , calling what happened an &quot; over@@ si@@ ght &quot; and &quot; a@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ z@@ ing &quot; to Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n , D@@ er S@@ pi@@ e@@ ge@@ l reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the f@@ ast di@@ al list , &quot; S@@ ud@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Z@@ e@@ it@@ un@@ g quo@@ ted a K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki representative as saying .

the tro@@ u@@ ble started when law en@@ for@@ cement offic@@ ers tried to dis@@ per@@ se the stud@@ ents , which led to the police using ru@@ b@@ ber bu@@ ll@@ ets and te@@ ar gas .
several hund@@ red stud@@ ents took part in the demonstra@@ tion to express their dis@@ may at the plans .

trade between Russia &a@@ mp@@ ; Iran sur@@ ges 7@@ 1 % - R@@ T Bus@@ in@@ ess
with the lif@@ ting of sanctions , trade tur@@ no@@ ver between Mos@@ co@@ w and T@@ eh@@ ran has gro@@ wn 7@@ 0.@@ 9 perc@@ ent in ye@@ ar@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year terms , according to Russia &apos;s amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or to Iran , L@@ ev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an .
since international sanctions against Iran were lif@@ ted , there has been a sur@@ ge in interest from Russian fir@@ ms in doing business in the country , the amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or said .
Russian companies are res@@ um@@ ing existing ties with Iran , while new fir@@ ms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further ex@@ pan@@ sion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an said .
he noted that in the first five months of 20@@ 16 the trade tur@@ no@@ ver between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 perc@@ ent compared to the same period of 20@@ 15 and amoun@@ ted to $ 8@@ 5@@ 6 million .
in particular , Russian ex@@ ports to Iran ju@@ mp@@ ed by 9@@ 1.@@ 5 perc@@ ent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 9@@ 7 million .
Russian impor@@ ts from Iran increased by 16 perc@@ ent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the bo@@ ost in trade was achieved by sup@@ p@@ lies of ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or said .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ y@@ an is also expec@@ ting a record number of Iran@@ ian tou@@ ris@@ ts to visit Russia this year .
last year , the Russian diplom@@ atic mission in Iran issu@@ ed about 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 vis@@ as , m@@ os@@ tly travel , to Iran@@ ian citizens .
in addition , for the first time Iran ente@@ red the top 20 countries by number of tou@@ ris@@ ts vis@@ iting Russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of Iran@@ ian tou@@ ris@@ ts vis@@ iting Russia will be bro@@ ken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , rela@@ tively few Rus@@ si@@ ans are vis@@ iting Iran , something the amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or hop@@ es will change .
&quot; I can personally recom@@ mend to visit the c@@ ities of Is@@ fa@@ han , S@@ hi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ a@@ z@@ d that have preser@@ ved mon@@ u@@ ments of an@@ ci@@ ent Per@@ sian civil@@ iz@@ ation in good condition , &quot; he said .

the G@@ las@@ we@@ gian 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old was in the an@@ ch@@ or role that his fellow Scot@@ sman S@@ ir Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ o@@ y made his own and the youn@@ g@@ s@@ ter did the leg@@ end pro@@ ud as he stor@@ med home to s@@ n@@ at@@ ch vic@@ tory from the fav@@ ou@@ red New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and out@@ f@@ it .
Bri@@ tain claim@@ ed a sho@@ ck vic@@ tory four years ago to w@@ in as H@@ o@@ y claim@@ ed the fif@@ th of his six Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ ol@@ ds .
and they repe@@ ated the tric@@ k after fin@@ is@@ hing a low@@ ly si@@ x@@ th at March &apos;s T@@ rac@@ k World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in L@@ on@@ d@@ on , despite H@@ o@@ y having since re@@ ti@@ red .
the issue between B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and L@@ on@@ d@@ on was re@@ pla@@ cing speci@@ alist star@@ ter J@@ a@@ mi@@ e Sta@@ ff .
they did so just in time as H@@ ind@@ es emer@@ ged .
H@@ o@@ y &apos;s re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment also created a vo@@ id which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and M@@ at@@ t C@@ ra@@ mp@@ ton tried to f@@ ill .
S@@ k@@ inn@@ er was the man Bri@@ tain &apos;s co@@ ac@@ hes stu@@ ck with , seeing potential in the S@@ co@@ t which has now been realis@@ ed .
H@@ ind@@ es , K@@ enn@@ y - cha@@ mp@@ ions with H@@ o@@ y four years ago - and S@@ k@@ inn@@ er set an Ol@@ ymp@@ ic record in quali@@ fying , but the standard was over@@ taken by New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and in the first round .
and the British tri@@ o w@@ on the du@@ el for g@@ old .
H@@ ind@@ es was n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly behind after his la@@ p , but K@@ enn@@ y pus@@ hed the te@@ am in fron@@ t and S@@ k@@ inn@@ er held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the trans@@ for@@ mation , with H@@ ind@@ es rid@@ ing a b@@ ig@@ ger ge@@ ar to s@@ low him down and allow K@@ enn@@ y and , in particular , S@@ k@@ inn@@ er to keep p@@ ace .
H@@ o@@ y w@@ at@@ ched on from his position as a B@@ B@@ C pun@@ dit and cau@@ ght the e@@ ye of S@@ k@@ inn@@ er , K@@ enn@@ y and H@@ ind@@ es when they ste@@ pped on to the po@@ di@@ um .
the 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old S@@ k@@ inn@@ er , from G@@ las@@ go@@ w , said : &quot; it &apos;s a fla@@ t@@ tering compar@@ is@@ on . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an Ol@@ ymp@@ ic record in the final and be@@ at the world cha@@ mp@@ ions .
it was just inc@@ redi@@ ble .
there &apos;s no better way to w@@ in it .
after tri@@ u@@ mp@@ hing at L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 al@@ ong@@ side K@@ enn@@ y and H@@ o@@ y , H@@ ind@@ es ad@@ mitted to deliber@@ ately fall@@ ing to the tra@@ ck following a poor start .
he later re@@ trac@@ ted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Bri@@ tain &apos;s ri@@ val@@ s .
there was no such issue this time around in a su@@ pre@@ me vic@@ tory .
H@@ ind@@ es said : &quot; it felt like L@@ on@@ d@@ on , with all the G@@ B fla@@ gs in the stand . &quot;
we all as a te@@ am came together in the last three months .
we &apos;@@ ve been los@@ ing out on so many world tit@@ les , so to w@@ in the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics again is just a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing .
that is one event , one g@@ old med@@ al for the nation which w@@ on s@@ even out of 10 tra@@ ck tit@@ les in both B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
if that is a bar@@ om@@ e@@ ter of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me a@@ wa@@ its .
with the form K@@ enn@@ y demonstrated , it is not beyond the re@@ al@@ ms of possibility to imag@@ ine him repe@@ ating H@@ o@@ y &apos;s fe@@ at of w@@ inning three Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ ol@@ ds in one G@@ am@@ es .
that would see K@@ enn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years youn@@ ger than H@@ o@@ y , who is also bor@@ n on 23 March ( that seem@@ ingly sa@@ c@@ red date in British sport which is also the b@@ ir@@ th@@ day of S@@ te@@ ve R@@ ed@@ gra@@ ve , M@@ o F@@ ar@@ a@@ h and R@@ og@@ er B@@ ann@@ is@@ ter ) - take his tally to six g@@ old med@@ als and one sil@@ ver .
that would be the same as H@@ o@@ y &apos;s .
K@@ enn@@ y next compe@@ tes in the s@@ prin@@ t , which beg@@ ins on today and pla@@ ys out over three days .
the 2@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old from B@@ ol@@ ton said : &quot; I &apos;@@ m just enjo@@ ying this one for now .
the te@@ am event is always the best .
you get to w@@ in it with your ma@@ tes .
it &apos;s a bit l@@ on@@ ely w@@ inning on your own to be hon@@ est .
H@@ ind@@ es said : &quot; if he w@@ ins another two g@@ old med@@ als , he should get a k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only med@@ al event , but there was further good ne@@ ws for Bri@@ tain .
S@@ ir B@@ rad@@ le@@ y W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , E@@ D C@@ lan@@ cy , S@@ te@@ ven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in D@@ ou@@ l@@ l qualified fas@@ test in the four@@ -@@ man , four@@ -@@ kil@@ omet@@ res te@@ am pursu@@ it .

the world record , set in w@@ inning g@@ old at L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 , is 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 5@@ 9 .
the first round and final ( 10@@ .@@ 4@@ 2@@ p@@ m ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispu@@ te with com@@ mis@@ sa@@ i@@ res yesterday ahead of the quali@@ fication r@@ ide , when officials sum@@ mon@@ ed him to measure his he@@ ight .
in the cor@@ respon@@ ding women &apos;s event , which res@@ um@@ es and conclu@@ des tomorrow , La@@ ur@@ a T@@ ro@@ t@@ t , J@@ o@@ ann@@ a R@@ ow@@ sel@@ l S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ ati@@ e Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ b@@ al@@ d of M@@ il@@ n@@ ga@@ vi@@ e advan@@ ced in a world record time , c@@ loc@@ king 4 : 13@@ .@@ 2@@ 60 .
te@@ am G@@ B have come to rely on its mi@@ gh@@ ty tra@@ ck cy@@ cl@@ ing s@@ qu@@ ad to take ow@@ nership of the m@@ iddle period of an Ol@@ ymp@@ ic G@@ am@@ es and del@@ iv@@ er a h@@ ost of med@@ als .
after truly excep@@ tional show@@ ings of ut@@ ter domin@@ ance at B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and L@@ on@@ d@@ on , expectations have been played down in the lead@@ -@@ up to Ri@@ o .
there have been dra@@ mas in the back@@ ground , not least the res@@ ig@@ nation of technical direc@@ tor S@@ han@@ e S@@ ut@@ ton in April a@@ mid sex@@ ism and bu@@ ll@@ ying all@@ eg@@ ations , and the re@@ ti@@ re@@ ments of gi@@ ant figures like H@@ o@@ y and V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s rac@@ ing in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me , it loo@@ ks like G@@ B &apos;s now leg@@ end@@ ary re@@ pu@@ tation for pe@@ a@@ king at the perfec@@ t time could be about to be repe@@ ated once again .
Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter &apos;s future in doubt with a@@ x@@ ing of power contrac@@ t
the future of the Por@@ t@@ land alu@@ min@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter in V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia - and the jobs of hund@@ re@@ ds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which sup@@ p@@ lies the pl@@ ant dis@@ clos@@ ing one of the pl@@ ant &apos;s ow@@ ners is to termin@@ ate a supply contrac@@ t , with all supply contracts expected to be a@@ xed .
the move follow@@ s the decision of the V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the pl@@ ant in operation .
a 20@@ -@@ year fi@@ xed sub@@ sid@@ y ex@@ pi@@ res in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s Por@@ t@@ land pl@@ ant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and in@@ direct - could be at risk with any clos@@ ure .
and there could be additional kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on effects since the sm@@ el@@ ter consum@@ es around 10 per cent of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s entire electricity out@@ put .
in 20@@ 14 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Po@@ in@@ t H@@ en@@ ry sm@@ el@@ ter which led to the clos@@ ure last year of the Ang@@ l@@ es@@ e@@ a power pl@@ ant .
Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter is los@@ ing money and risks clos@@ ure .
the mo@@ ves follow@@ s spec@@ ulation about the future of the pl@@ ant for several years now , initi@@ ally in the wa@@ ke of the strong Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ian doll@@ ar and more recently due to the price for the out@@ put from the pl@@ ant .
A@@ G@@ L , which sup@@ p@@ lies the big alu@@ min@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter with electricity from its L@@ o@@ y Y@@ an@@ g A power pl@@ ant in the Lat@@ ro@@ be V@@ alle@@ y , said it ex@@ pects the other three ow@@ ners will also move to termin@@ ate their agreements .
the pl@@ ant is majority ow@@ ned by a joint ven@@ ture of Al@@ co@@ a and A@@ lu@@ min@@ a , with China &apos;s C@@ I@@ T@@ I@@ C and Jap@@ an &apos;s Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding small@@ er shar@@ es .
&quot; A@@ G@@ L ex@@ pects the Por@@ t@@ land fac@@ ility to continue to operate , mean@@ ing p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal demand for electricity from the sm@@ el@@ ter will continue , &quot; it said .
A@@ G@@ L said the contracts are so@@ -@@ called &apos; h@@ ed@@ ging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from November 20@@ 16 .
the contracts have a 12@@ -@@ month termin@@ ation period so they will actually fin@@ ish in 20@@ 17 .
&quot; as such , A@@ G@@ L continues to expect the contracts to contribute to ear@@ n@@ ings in fis@@ cal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential ear@@ n@@ ings impact on A@@ G@@ L from F@@ Y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong fu@@ tures market out@@ look for wh@@ oles@@ ale electricity prices .
A@@ G@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accoun@@ ts by $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anti@@ ci@@ pation of a termin@@ ation event . &quot;
Al@@ co@@ a said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s ... ability to operate the sm@@ el@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the sm@@ el@@ ter . &quot;
the US company said it ente@@ red into a 20@@ -@@ year contrac@@ t with L@@ o@@ y Y@@ an@@ g in 2010 , which was due to com@@ men@@ ce from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pu@@ ll@@ ed out of the contrac@@ t .
analys@@ ts have been w@@ ary of the possible clos@@ ure of both of the Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter in V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia and also the T@@ om@@ ago pl@@ ant ne@@ ar Ne@@ w@@ cas@@ t@@ le due to the poor econom@@ ics of the industry .
addres@@ sing analys@@ ts earlier in the week , A@@ G@@ L &apos;s head of operations , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en M@@ ik@@ kel@@ sen said Por@@ t@@ land uses around 6@@ 00 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of power ann@@ u@@ ally and T@@ om@@ ago around 9@@ 00 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts .
if both of those plan@@ ts go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a gener@@ a@@ tor that W@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an reality T@@ V sta@@ r , K@@ end@@ all &apos;s on the cover of September &apos;s vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enn@@ er , 20 , model and four@@ th d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter of mo@@ ther@@ -@@ manag@@ er K@@ r@@ is &apos;s Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ J@@ enn@@ er cl@@ an , is on the cover of US vo@@ gue &apos;s co@@ ve@@ ted September issue .
K@@ end@@ all , who is an E@@ ste@@ e La@@ ud@@ er br@@ and amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or and has w@@ al@@ ked in M@@ il@@ an , Par@@ is and New Yor@@ k fas@@ hi@@ on weeks , announced the ne@@ ws on her In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m account on Th@@ urs@@ day .
&quot; in a room with a b@@ un@@ ch of people I lo@@ ve , looking at this cover made me cr@@ y , &quot; K@@ end@@ all w@@ ro@@ te .
the cover re@@ vel@@ ation was followed by a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( or simply keeping U@@ p with the Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ ans@@ -@@ es@@ que ? ) , sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted reality v@@ ide@@ o that fe@@ atu@@ red the entire Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ J@@ enn@@ er family ( b@@ ar tro@@ ub@@ lem@@ ak@@ ers Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ y@@ n , and join@@ ed by everyone &apos;s fav@@ our@@ ite show@@ bi@@ z unc@@ le , keeping U@@ p produc@@ er R@@ y@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) for@@ getting about their sis@@ ter &apos;s cover , only to end with the classi@@ c tw@@ ist : they were all planning a surpris@@ e party .
it &apos;s the cl@@ ic@@ he plo@@ t line of ne@@ arly every &quot; b@@ ir@@ th@@ day &quot; ep@@ is@@ od@@ e of a children &apos;s television show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest deli@@ vers the line , &quot; Y@@ o@@ u thought we for@@ got about you ? , &quot; with the sinc@@ er@@ ity of a car@@ to@@ on ra@@ b@@ bit in an 8@@ am ti@@ m@@ es@@ lot ) , but K@@ r@@ is had to get her other g@@ ir@@ ls in on this pub@@ lic@@ ity some@@ how .
because , with a spo@@ t on vo@@ gue &apos;s September issue , we have surely ente@@ red a new er@@ a of Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sis@@ ter Ki@@ m may have be@@ a@@ ten her to the cover of vo@@ gue ( she shared it with h@@ us@@ b@@ and K@@ any@@ e W@@ est in April 20@@ 14 ) , but the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine &apos;s September cover is a le@@ ag@@ ue un@@ to itself .
the September issue is vo@@ gue &apos;s highest sell@@ ing ed@@ ition of the year .
with a th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness more closely res@@ emb@@ ling a co@@ ff@@ ee table bo@@ ok than a fas@@ hi@@ on ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , the issue at@@ trac@@ ts a huge number of adver@@ tis@@ ers ( F@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ is@@ ta coun@@ ted 6@@ 15 of last year &apos;s 8@@ 3@@ 2@@ -@@ pa@@ ge tom@@ e as adver@@ tis@@ ing content ) .
the re@@ vel@@ ation of its cover sta@@ r is so ho@@ tly anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted that , in the past two years , pic@@ tures of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine have been le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announ@@ cement .
previous women to fe@@ a@@ ture on the cover include Na@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bel@@ l , L@@ ind@@ a E@@ van@@ g@@ el@@ is@@ ta and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , the cover has certainly fe@@ atu@@ red more &quot; cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities who model &quot; than &quot; mod@@ els who are cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities . &quot;
O@@ sc@@ ar w@@ inn@@ er and Di@@ or amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence was fe@@ atu@@ red in 20@@ 13 , the year after L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a had the hon@@ our .
but , even on the off@@ -@@ chance that M@@ s J@@ enn@@ er - who is described by the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine as the &quot; bre@@ ak@@ out model &quot; of her generation - fall@@ s into the former category , she is in pre@@ tty good company .
these cel@@ e@@ br@@ ities are not rela@@ tives of fam@@ ous people , or reality star@@ s , or kid@@ s these days who know how to make a good S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at v@@ ide@@ o ( although J@@ enn@@ er is all of these things ) .
they are legitim@@ ately tal@@ ented women , excell@@ ing in the enter@@ tain@@ ment industry .
B@@ e@@ y@@ once , who appe@@ ared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strong@@ est years of her care@@ er with the rele@@ ase of L@@ em@@ on@@ ade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position within the fas@@ hi@@ on world was always going to be f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght .
in June , original V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Secre@@ t model S@@ te@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Se@@ y@@ m@@ our critic@@ ised J@@ enn@@ er and her colleague G@@ ig@@ i H@@ ad@@ id , calling them the &quot; b@@ it@@ ches of the moment . &quot;
this s@@ enti@@ ment has bo@@ iled up again with the ne@@ ws of J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s vo@@ gue cover appe@@ ar@@ ance .
but d@@ w@@ elling on the dis@@ content seems bes@@ ide the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enn@@ er is on the cover of the September issue of vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model , in the pu@@ rest sense of the word .
she &apos;s w@@ al@@ king for Mar@@ c J@@ ac@@ ob@@ s .
she &apos;s sell@@ ing you E@@ ste@@ e La@@ ud@@ er found@@ ation .
she , and all of her sis@@ ters , are sell@@ ing you pic@@ tures of themselves on their respective pay@@ w@@ all@@ ed app@@ s .
she &apos;s sell@@ ing pic@@ tures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ ra@@ w@@ for@@ d &apos;s d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter she p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed to lo@@ ve ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
and , in her do@@ w@@ n@@ time , possibly just as a way still to see sis@@ ter K@@ our@@ t@@ ne@@ y and her kid@@ s , she &apos;s on reality television .
Community legal cent@@ res turn away 16@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 people a year
more than 16@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 of the nation &apos;s most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able are turned away from community legal cent@@ res every year , with the sector b@@ rac@@ ing itself for the impact further funding cu@@ ts will have on al@@ read@@ y@@ -@@ stre@@ t@@ ched operations .
in Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - m@@ os@@ tly the el@@ der@@ ly , immigrants , v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight un@@ fair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and repres@@ entation .
Community legal services , already stre@@ t@@ ched beyond limits , are b@@ rac@@ ing for further cu@@ ts .
from June next year , those legal cent@@ res are s@@ lated to lose another 30 per cent of their feder@@ al funding .
Direc@@ tor of Community Legal C@@ ent@@ res Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land J@@ am@@ es F@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l said the latest N@@ ational As@@ soci@@ ation of Community Legal C@@ ent@@ res cen@@ su@@ s Re@@ port found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
Mr F@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l said without a re@@ vers@@ al of the feder@@ al government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community legal cent@@ res are ch@@ ron@@ ically under@@ fund@@ ed , mean@@ ing thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people lea@@ ving viol@@ ent relation@@ ships , people with un@@ manag@@ e@@ able and cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing deb@@ ts , families going through separ@@ ation , workers who are un@@ fair@@ ly sa@@ c@@ ked - all of these people have problems with legal d@@ im@@ ensi@@ ons , and this report shows that they &apos;@@ re not able to get the help they need .
the feder@@ al government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 20@@ 17 , which means thousands more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ lan@@ ders will be forced to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the A@@ t@@ tor@@ ne@@ y@@ -@@ General , and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land S@@ en@@ a@@ tor Geor@@ ge B@@ ran@@ d@@ is to immediately re@@ ver@@ se these funding cu@@ ts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;@@ re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government deli@@ ver@@ ed on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal cent@@ res and their c@@ li@@ ent communities , and for the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ z@@ u@@ k government to inv@@ est in this important work .
D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p campaign su@@ ed after sta@@ ffer all@@ eg@@ ed@@ ly pu@@ ll@@ ed a gu@@ n
new Yor@@ k : D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign was su@@ ed for all@@ eg@@ ed@@ ly doing nothing after being told that the direc@@ tor of its North Car@@ ol@@ ina operations pu@@ ll@@ ed a gu@@ n on a sta@@ ffer as they dro@@ ve in a J@@ e@@ ep in February .
the inc@@ ident was described in a law@@ su@@ it f@@ iled on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day in state court in Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te by V@@ inc@@ ent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former so@@ f@@ tw@@ are train@@ er for the state campaign .
B@@ ordin@@ i said he wa@@ ited for months for the situation to be hand@@ led inter@@ n@@ ally before realis@@ ing &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the direc@@ tor , E@@ ar@@ l P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p , &quot; produced a p@@ is@@ to@@ l , put his right inde@@ x fin@@ ger on the tri@@ gg@@ er , and dro@@ ve the bar@@ re@@ l into V@@ inc@@ ent &apos;s k@@ ne@@ e ca@@ p , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ in@@ t .
after compla@@ in@@ ing to local and regional campaign lead@@ ership , B@@ ordin@@ i lear@@ ned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with P@@ h@@ ill@@ i@@ p , according to the fil@@ ing .
&quot; g@@ un@@ s d@@ on &apos;@@ t have to fir@@ e to inf@@ lic@@ t damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ in@@ t .
the su@@ it comes just two days after the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an presid@@ ential n@@ om@@ ine@@ e caused a f@@ uro@@ re when tell@@ ing a cro@@ w@@ d in North Car@@ ol@@ ina that the &quot; Sec@@ ond Amendment people &quot; -@@ - understood to be gu@@ n ow@@ ners and gu@@ n en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ ts -@@ - could take action if his ri@@ val H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton were elected and gets her pic@@ k of jud@@ ges .

Bri@@ tain must chan@@ nel the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and ex@@ p@@ and He@@ a@@ th@@ row
He@@ a@@ th@@ row will also del@@ iv@@ er reg@@ ener@@ ation and prosper@@ ity not just in our local communities and across L@@ on@@ d@@ on , but across the country .
for me , this was the great at@@ trac@@ tion of He@@ a@@ th@@ row , just as it was with L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions bene@@ fi@@ ted from the G@@ am@@ es .
the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics achieved huge benefits for S@@ tra@@ t@@ for@@ d and the East En@@ d .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and fir@@ ms close to He@@ a@@ th@@ row .
for our local communities alone we &apos;@@ l@@ l create 10@@ ,@@ 000 new ap@@ pr@@ en@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 new jobs and bring an end to y@@ outh unemployment around the air@@ port .
just as there were ahead of L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 , there will be those that think the challenge of He@@ a@@ th@@ row ex@@ pan@@ sion is too great .
I was told that Bri@@ tain would be never be ready for the G@@ am@@ es and that we would be embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong on 20@@ 12 and they will be proved wrong on He@@ a@@ th@@ row .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but He@@ a@@ th@@ row is answ@@ ering every question asked of it .
like the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics , He@@ a@@ th@@ row is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
ex@@ pan@@ sion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11@@ b@@ n in economic growth , lea@@ ving a leg@@ acy of s@@ kill@@ s and employment both around the air@@ port and across the UK .
we have a great te@@ am at He@@ a@@ th@@ row who have implemented an £ 11@@ b@@ n programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T@@ 5 - voted the world &apos;s best air@@ port termin@@ al five years in a row , to T@@ 2 , buil@@ t in the m@@ iddle of the world &apos;s bu@@ si@@ est two run@@ ways .
now they stand ready to del@@ iv@@ er a third run@@ way , bac@@ ked by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 12 G@@ am@@ es were a great success for the UK and I am conf@@ ident that He@@ a@@ th@@ row ex@@ pan@@ sion will be too .
it is time for us to chan@@ nel that Ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and ex@@ p@@ and He@@ a@@ th@@ row , sec@@ uring our tra@@ ding future and creating a leg@@ acy of s@@ kill@@ s and employment that Bri@@ tain can be pro@@ ud of .

for companies that make money from on@@ line adver@@ tis@@ ing , attemp@@ ts to circum@@ v@@ ent ad@@ -@@ b@@ loc@@ king so@@ f@@ tw@@ are amount to a &quot; cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ m@@ ouse ga@@ me , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
on Th@@ urs@@ day , just two days after F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok announced it would be b@@ loc@@ king ad B@@ loc@@ kers on its des@@ k@@ top sit@@ e , A@@ d@@ blo@@ ck P@@ lu@@ s published a blo@@ g post saying that users could up@@ date their fil@@ ters in its pro@@ gra@@ m to blo@@ ck ads on the social network once again .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok said that its des@@ k@@ top we@@ b@@ sit@@ e would change the cod@@ ing around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad B@@ loc@@ kers to de@@ te@@ c@@ t which parts of a pa@@ ge are ads .
but A@@ d@@ blo@@ ck now says it has g@@ ot@@ ten around the new cod@@ es .
in a blo@@ g post , A@@ d@@ blo@@ ck spo@@ kes@@ person B@@ en W@@ ill@@ i@@ am@@ s w@@ ro@@ te that &quot; this sort of back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th b@@ attle between the open source ad@@ -@@ b@@ loc@@ king community and circum@@ ven@@ ters has been going on since ad b@@ loc@@ king was in@@ ven@@ ted , &quot; and that it is possible F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok would come up with its own fi@@ x soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s larg@@ est social media company has ente@@ red the fight is a strong ind@@ ication of just how big a concern ad B@@ loc@@ kers have become for the industry .
glob@@ ally , rou@@ gh@@ ly 200 million people use ad B@@ loc@@ kers , according to a study last year from P@@ ag@@ e@@ fair and A@@ do@@ be ; ne@@ arly qu@@ ad@@ rup@@ le the number who used such so@@ f@@ tw@@ are in 20@@ 13 .
with 1.@@ 0@@ 3 billion daily active users acc@@ essing F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok via mo@@ b@@ ile dev@@ ices , mo@@ b@@ ile adver@@ tis@@ ing now accoun@@ ts for 8@@ 4 per cent of F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok &apos;s adver@@ tis@@ ing re@@ ven@@ ue .
the company is going after ad B@@ loc@@ kers on des@@ k@@ top however , because mo@@ b@@ ile ad B@@ loc@@ kers are not effective in F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok &apos;s mo@@ b@@ ile app@@ s for the social network and In@@ sta@@ gra@@ m , a spo@@ kes@@ person said .
D@@ es@@ k@@ top ads still account for enough re@@ ven@@ ue that F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok jud@@ ged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on Tu@@ es@@ day , F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok said it would be up@@ d@@ ating its &quot; ad prefer@@ ences &quot; to@@ ol to give people more control over how ads are tar@@ ge@@ ted to them .
on Th@@ urs@@ day F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok claim@@ ed that A@@ d@@ blo@@ ck &apos;s new fil@@ ters were concerning because they would also blo@@ ck some n@@ on@@ -@@ adver@@ tis@@ ing content on the sit@@ e .
&quot; this is@@ n &apos;@@ t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok spo@@ kes@@ person said in an e@@ -@@ ma@@ iled statement .
ad B@@ loc@@ kers are a b@@ l@@ un@@ t instrument , which is why we &apos;@@ ve instead foc@@ used on building to@@ ols like A@@ d P@@ refer@@ ences to put control in people &apos;s hands .
w@@ oman run over on Sw@@ is@@ s mot@@ or@@ way in appar@@ ent su@@ ic@@ ide
the victi@@ m was lying on the mot@@ or@@ way in the m@@ iddle of the night .
police are appe@@ al@@ ing for wit@@ n@@ esses after a w@@ oman was run over by several vehicles on a mot@@ or@@ way in the early hours of Th@@ urs@@ day in an appar@@ ent act of su@@ ic@@ ide .
the inc@@ ident happened on the A@@ 1 ne@@ ar Mor@@ ges in the can@@ ton of V@@ au@@ d just after mid@@ night on Th@@ urs@@ day .
a w@@ oman la@@ y down in the d@@ ar@@ k on the road &quot; in a des@@ per@@ ate act &quot; and was h@@ it by several vehicles , V@@ au@@ d police said in a statement .
clearly looking to k@@ ill her@@ self , the victi@@ m , a Sw@@ is@@ s w@@ oman aged 4@@ 9 , was h@@ it by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry .
she di@@ ed at the sc@@ ene .
several of the dri@@ vers involved have already been inter@@ vie@@ wed but some are still un@@ identi@@ fied , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the inc@@ ident to come forward .
a criminal investig@@ ation has been open@@ ed , a &quot; log@@ ical &quot; step in a situation like this , law@@ yer G@@ ill@@ es H@@ of@@ s@@ te@@ t@@ ter told L@@ e T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the dri@@ vers involved will face char@@ ges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecu@@ tor must determin@@ e , &quot; said H@@ of@@ s@@ te@@ t@@ ter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that dri@@ vers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person w@@ al@@ king on the mot@@ or@@ way in the d@@ ar@@ k - it was jud@@ ged that mot@@ or@@ ists cannot expect to come across a pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an on the mot@@ or@@ way in the m@@ iddle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police offic@@ er was acqu@@ it@@ ted of ca@@ using death by neg@@ li@@ gence after she h@@ it and kill@@ ed a man who was lying on the A@@ 1 ne@@ ar Pa@@ y@@ ner@@ ne one night in A@@ ug@@ ust 20@@ 14 .
the 2@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old victi@@ m had been d@@ rin@@ king and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ w@@ oman -@@ - who was respon@@ ding to an emergency call -@@ - was dri@@ ving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely excep@@ tional and un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table situation , &quot; the jud@@ ge said .
anyone with information about Th@@ urs@@ day &apos;s inc@@ ident ne@@ ar Mor@@ ges should call police on 02@@ 1 6@@ 44 8@@ 3 4@@ 6 or 02@@ 1 6@@ 44 44 44 .
N@@ A@@ S@@ A climate model : V@@ en@@ us was once ha@@ b@@ itable
V@@ en@@ us was likely once ha@@ b@@ itable , according to the pro@@ jec@@ tions of a new N@@ A@@ S@@ A climate model .
sci@@ ent@@ ists at N@@ A@@ S@@ A &apos;s G@@ od@@ d@@ ard In@@ stitu@@ te for S@@ p@@ ace S@@ tu@@ dies developed a model to expl@@ or@@ e V@@ en@@ us &apos; past using to@@ ols and al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms similar to those employed by climate sci@@ ent@@ ists .

the model produced a s@@ tory of V@@ en@@ us similar to the ev@@ olution pre@@ viously hy@@ po@@ th@@ esi@@ z@@ ed by plan@@ e@@ tary sci@@ ent@@ ists .

C@@ ol@@ or@@ ad@@ o execu@@ tive vice presid@@ ent / general manag@@ er J@@ o@@ e Sa@@ ki@@ c confirmed the move and noted that the c@@ lu@@ b will begin a se@@ ar@@ ch for a new co@@ ach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , I have carried out my du@@ ties as head co@@ ach and vice presid@@ ent of ho@@ c@@ key operations for the C@@ ol@@ or@@ ad@@ o a@@ val@@ an@@ ch@@ e with energy , pas@@ sion and determination , &quot; the 5@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Ro@@ y said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the sum@@ mer about how I might improve this te@@ am to give it the de@@ p@@ th it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the co@@ ach and V@@ P@@ -@@ ho@@ c@@ key operations needs to be perfectly al@@ ig@@ ned with that of the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the te@@ am &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sa@@ ki@@ c , who hi@@ red Ro@@ y on May 23 , 20@@ 13 , than@@ ked Ro@@ y for his contributions to the te@@ am .
&quot; Pat@@ ric@@ k informed me of his decision today , &quot; Sa@@ ki@@ c said .
we appreci@@ ate all he has done for our Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation and wish him the best of lu@@ ck in the future .

North Se@@ a oil workers res@@ u@@ me talks , suspen@@ d strik@@ e
L@@ ab@@ or strik@@ es over pay for North Se@@ a oil workers are suspen@@ ded while all parties to the dispu@@ te sit down for a new round of talks , lead negoti@@ ators said .
strik@@ es against o@@ il@@ field services company W@@ ood Group have been sta@@ ged s@@ por@@ ad@@ ically on pla@@ t@@ forms in the North Se@@ a oper@@ ated by Ro@@ y@@ al D@@ ut@@ ch S@@ hel@@ l .
&quot; w@@ ood Group and the U@@ n@@ ite and R@@ M@@ T union@@ s can confirm we have agreed to res@@ tar@@ t the process for resolution of the current dispu@@ te , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of fu@@ ll@@ -@@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a f@@ res@@ h look at the issues .
the lab@@ or union@@ s said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in prote@@ st of potential pay cu@@ ts of up to 30 perc@@ ent .
w@@ ood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Se@@ a contrac@@ tors by about 9 perc@@ ent because of negative market pres@@ su@@ res .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follow@@ s a 10 perc@@ ent dec@@ reas@@ e for on@@ shor@@ e contrac@@ tors in 20@@ 14 .
the company said additional cu@@ ts would give the company the room needed to move through the market do@@ w@@ n@@ turn .
sh@@ el@@ l , for its part , has tr@@ im@@ med thousands of people from its pay@@ ro@@ l@@ l and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stre@@ am@@ lines its operations in the wa@@ ke of its me@@ ga@@ -@@ mer@@ ger with British energy company B@@ G Group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower cr@@ ude oil prices , an economic situation comp@@ oun@@ ded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scot@@ t@@ ish Member of Parliament D@@ a@@ ve An@@ der@@ son met with lab@@ or leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est lab@@ or dispu@@ tes to strik@@ e the North Se@@ a in a generation .
the North Se@@ a , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Se@@ a and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.@@ 4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Se@@ a is expected in 20@@ 16 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er measures sp@@ in rates of star@@ s in P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es cl@@ us@@ ter
the latest mission by the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ c@@ ope has help@@ ed as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ers collec@@ t the most complete ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ g of sp@@ in rates among the star@@ s of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es cl@@ us@@ ter .
the new data is helping as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ers understand why star@@ s in the cl@@ us@@ ter sp@@ in at var@@ ying rates , as well as how ro@@ tation perio@@ ds rela@@ te to plan@@ et for@@ mation .
&quot; we hope that by compar@@ ing our results to other sta@@ r cl@@ us@@ ters , we will learn more about the relationship between a sta@@ r &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its sol@@ ar system , &quot; Lu@@ isa Re@@ b@@ ul@@ l , a research sci@@ ent@@ ist at C@@ al@@ te@@ ch &apos;s inf@@ r@@ ared Proc@@ essing and An@@ al@@ y@@ sis C@@ enter in P@@ as@@ ad@@ ena , said in a ne@@ ws rele@@ ase .
the P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es cl@@ us@@ ter is sit@@ u@@ ated 4@@ 45 li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ years from E@@ ar@@ th .
many of the star@@ s in the cl@@ us@@ ter are just now reaching ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood , having been bor@@ n rou@@ gh@@ ly 1@@ 25 million years ago .
they &apos;@@ re sp@@ inning as f@@ ast as they ever will .
at their pe@@ a@@ k sp@@ in rates , these ma@@ turing star@@ s e@@ ject large amounts of s@@ tell@@ ar w@@ in@@ d .
as these w@@ in@@ ds travel across the star@@ s &apos; ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic fields , they en@@ act a b@@ ra@@ king effect on the star@@ s .
as a sta@@ r ages , its sp@@ in rate beg@@ ins to s@@ low down .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er measures each sta@@ r &apos;s sp@@ in rate by trac@@ king the time between the appe@@ ar@@ ance of rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ able star@@ spo@@ ts -@@ - like su@@ n@@ spo@@ ts .
the latest ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ g of sp@@ in rates sugges@@ ts more mas@@ sive star@@ s sp@@ in more s@@ low@@ ly than less mas@@ sive star@@ s .
Re@@ b@@ ul@@ l lik@@ ens the star@@ s to d@@ an@@ c@@ ers , larg@@ er ones pi@@ rou@@ etting more s@@ low@@ ly than small@@ er ones .
&quot; in the &apos; b@@ all@@ et &apos; of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es , we see that s@@ low ro@@ ta@@ tors ten@@ d to be more mas@@ sive , where@@ as the fas@@ test ro@@ ta@@ tors ten@@ d to be very light star@@ s , &quot; said Re@@ b@@ ul@@ l .
because the P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es cl@@ us@@ ter is so close , it ser@@ ves as an ide@@ al cos@@ mic lab@@ or@@ atory to compar@@ e s@@ tell@@ ar qu@@ alities with sp@@ in rates .
&quot; the P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es sta@@ r cl@@ us@@ ter provides an an@@ ch@@ or for the@@ ore@@ tical mod@@ els of s@@ tell@@ ar ro@@ tation going both direc@@ tions , youn@@ ger and ol@@ der , &quot; said Re@@ b@@ ul@@ l .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why star@@ s s@@ low their sp@@ in rates and han@@ g up their &apos; d@@ ance sho@@ es , &apos; so to speak .
Re@@ b@@ ul@@ l and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of P@@ le@@ i@@ ad@@ es sp@@ in rates in three new paper@@ s , soon to be published in the as@@ tr@@ onom@@ ical J@@ our@@ nal .
