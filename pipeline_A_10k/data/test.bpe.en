Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er wanted to change her gender , was di@@ ag@@ nos@@ ed with a mental ill@@ ness and is now making ar@@ t on the them@@ e - &quot; People should have the right to their own body &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of pati@@ ent reports are han@@ ging from the c@@ eil@@ ing of the Pro@@ ject Ro@@ om g@@ all@@ ery of the Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts .
the name of Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er is written on every one of them .
the reports tell a long s@@ tory of what kind of an interpre@@ tation other people have written of A@@ u@@ er and her id@@ entity -
decided on who she is on her behalf .
&quot; I wanted to dis@@ close my personal med@@ ical history to highlight the violence of the whole process , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
here , &quot; process &quot; ref@@ ers to her se@@ x reas@@ sig@@ n@@ ment procedure .
it is a man@@ y@@ -@@ year examin@@ ation period , including meetings with p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ists , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ris@@ ts , n@@ ur@@ ses and p@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans .
the process star@@ ts with a refer@@ ral to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose a gender id@@ entity dis@@ order . these di@@ ag@@ nos@@ es are per@@ for@@ med in Tamper@@ e and Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
A@@ u@@ er &apos;s process started four years ago .
before this , she had already been using o@@ es@@ tro@@ gen ord@@ ered from the inter@@ net and was also otherwise far in her own reas@@ sig@@ n@@ ment procedure .
even though she felt like a w@@ oman , F@@ inn@@ ish legislation states that an individual must under@@ go a reas@@ sig@@ n@@ ment procedure before the gender can also be al@@ tered legally .
the Ac@@ t on the Legal R@@ ec@@ og@@ n@@ ition of the G@@ ender of Trans@@ sex@@ u@@ als ( 5@@ 6@@ 3 / 2002 ) , or the tr@@ ans act , obli@@ ga@@ tes trans@@ gender people to a compulsory ster@@ il@@ isation so that their correct gender can be regis@@ tered , for example , in the P@@ op@@ ulation R@@ eg@@ is@@ ter C@@ entr@@ e and their pass@@ port .
currently , each person about to change their gender is required to have a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis and a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate of their in@@ ability to re@@ produce .
people should have the right to decide on their own body .
&quot; this situation is in@@ toler@@ able and in viol@@ ation of human rights , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
amendments to the F@@ inn@@ ish tr@@ ans act have been on the table for long .
the UN Human Rights Council has issu@@ ed eight concerns regarding the act , and the European Court of Human Rights has a preced@@ ent that obli@@ ga@@ tes parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to ad@@ here to the right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination .
the former Government of Fin@@ land prepared the amendments to the act under S@@ us@@ ann@@ e H@@ u@@ o@@ v@@ inen , the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health .
after the following elections , the F@@ inn@@ s Party received se@@ ats in the Government .
now , the amendments are again at a stand@@ still
due to internal dis@@ agreements that are not even related to this particular act .
&quot; the Government is not willing to han@@ dle the act , as there are dis@@ agreements over the amendments within the Government , &quot; says Fran@@ k Joh@@ ans@@ son , direc@@ tor of Am@@ nes@@ ty Fin@@ land .
the fron@@ t of the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition area is domin@@ ated by two large ins@@ tall@@ ations .
one of these is made of the packa@@ ges and ins@@ truc@@ tions of medic@@ in@@ al products used by A@@ u@@ er .
any vis@@ itor to the pati@@ ent record ins@@ tall@@ ation can read , for example , the interpre@@ tation a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ist working in the trans@@ gender de@@ part@@ ment of Tamper@@ e Uni@@ versity H@@ os@@ p@@ ital has made of A@@ u@@ er .
the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ist met Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er two times and , on the basis of these meetings , w@@ ro@@ te a report that would define A@@ u@@ er &apos;s rights to receive treatment and assistance .
the pati@@ ent &apos;s sense of reality is re@@ ported to be close to sha@@ king .
the pati@@ ent &apos;s concep@@ tion of her@@ self seems to be dis@@ organised as a b@@ ord@@ er@@ line case and the un@@ sta@@ ble fe@@ a@@ tures of her person@@ ality are emphas@@ ised .
A@@ u@@ er does not recognise her@@ self from these reports .
&quot; it was sho@@ cking to hear that I was di@@ ag@@ nos@@ ed as men@@ tally ill , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
what was even more sho@@ cking was that A@@ u@@ er was not given access to gender reas@@ sig@@ n@@ ment sur@@ ger@@ y .
according to the n@@ ur@@ sing staff , she did not have sufficient resources to start the process .
her own id@@ entity was d@@ eni@@ ed from her .
on that day on 11 February 20@@ 15 , A@@ u@@ er w@@ al@@ ked out of the meeting and s@@ mas@@ hed a T@@ V in the waiting room of the trans@@ gender de@@ part@@ ment .
later , that T@@ V ev@@ ol@@ ved into a mon@@ u@@ ment for the exclu@@ ded , a work of ar@@ t through which A@@ u@@ er reflec@@ ts on her experi@@ ences in power and how it is exerc@@ ised .
&quot; it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y that anyone defined as a w@@ oman at b@@ ir@@ th can have their b@@ reas@@ ts enlarg@@ ed . but , to have b@@ reas@@ ts remo@@ ved al@@ together , a di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis is needed , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
you do not own your body if you feel that your gender is not the one defined at b@@ ir@@ th .
unfortunately , A@@ u@@ er &apos;s experience is not uni@@ que .
for many , a gender reas@@ sig@@ n@@ ment process is tou@@ gh@@ er men@@ tally than p@@ hy@@ si@@ cally as a result of med@@ ical operations .
anyone who under@@ goes the process meet@@ s do@@ z@@ ens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender id@@ entity .
&quot; it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y that treatment is d@@ eni@@ ed from people who need help and support by saying that they d@@ on &apos;@@ t have sufficient resources , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
many applying for the process have suffer@@ ed from mental dis@@ orders : de@@ pression , an@@ xi@@ ety and possibly bu@@ ll@@ ying .
by appe@@ al@@ ing to these , the n@@ ur@@ sing staff can decide that the process cannot be started .
&quot; if people are not given access to treatment and assistance , their situation may even become worse than it was before the process , &quot; says A@@ u@@ er .
A@@ u@@ er &apos;s personal ex@@ hi@@ bit also de@@ als with an@@ xi@@ ety and thou@@ ghts of su@@ ic@@ ide .
in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition bro@@ ch@@ ure , A@@ u@@ er w@@ ri@@ tes : &quot; I &apos;@@ ve had su@@ ic@@ id@@ al thou@@ ghts throughout my ad@@ ult life , and this is something people find hard to accept . &quot;
A@@ u@@ er has received medic@@ ine for her de@@ pression . when she started to take hor@@ mon@@ es , she also started to feel better .
she was finally able to put into words the feel@@ ings she had had since her child@@ ho@@ od and te@@ en@@ age -
why her wide ch@@ in did not seem to be quite right for her body and why her pec@@ tor@@ al mus@@ cles were round instead of f@@ l@@ at .
A@@ u@@ er has always found it important that she has people who can truly see her close to her .
being seen is a basic need .
&quot; I need to explain my existence through my words , c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , voice and mo@@ tions , &quot; she says .
currently , A@@ u@@ er fe@@ els that she is seen , and exists as a w@@ oman .
however , in the first p@@ has@@ es of the process , ran@@ dom comments by people close to her h@@ ur@@ t .
what h@@ ur@@ ts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incor@@ rec@@ tly .
&quot; they should know who I am , and they do know it , but they ref@@ use to accept it or can &apos;@@ t accept it , &quot; she continues .
however , not all trans@@ gender people want p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal al@@ te@@ ra@@ tions .
they do not su@@ ffer from the body d@@ ys@@ mor@@ p@@ hi@@ c dis@@ order , where@@ by their body or its parts can cause an@@ xi@@ ety or even p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal pain .
without the use of hor@@ mon@@ es or a l@@ eng@@ thy examin@@ ation process , it is not possible to have an official status for one &apos;s own gender .
&quot; there is no med@@ ical basis for these examin@@ ations , &quot; A@@ u@@ er says .
this is true .
for example , in Denmark , Parliament approved a new procedure for identi@@ fying the legal gender in June 20@@ 14 .
the new legislation is based on the right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination when it comes to the legal gender .
an ad@@ ult applic@@ ant needs to f@@ ile a written application for a new personal id@@ entity cod@@ e , indic@@ ating that they feel like they represent the other gender .
after a re@@ consideration period of six months , the applic@@ ant needs to confirm their application in wr@@ iting , after which the minis@@ try will provide the applic@@ ant with a new personal id@@ entity cod@@ e .
a similar right of sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination is also deman@@ ded in Fin@@ land , and this is also what character@@ ises A@@ u@@ er &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition .
the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition has not been any ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic experience for the ar@@ tis@@ t ; it is a political and ar@@ tis@@ tic collec@@ tion .
&quot; I want to believe that ar@@ t still matters and it help@@ s to achieve political changes , during a time when politicians have for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten about human rights . &quot;
Ca@@ mi@@ lle A@@ u@@ er &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition An@@ ti@@ p@@ hall@@ ic D@@ ic@@ k at the Pro@@ ject Ro@@ om of the Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts on 4@@ -@@ 28 July 20@@ 17 .
civil rights group issues travel war@@ ning for M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i
the N@@ ational As@@ soci@@ ation for the advan@@ cement of C@@ ol@@ o@@ red People has put out an al@@ er@@ t for people of col@@ or tra@@ vel@@ ing to M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i because of the state &apos;s discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the N@@ A@@ ACP Tra@@ vel A@@ d@@ vis@@ ory for the state of M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i , effective through A@@ ug@@ ust 2@@ 8@@ th , 20@@ 17 , calls for African American tra@@ vel@@ ers , vis@@ itors and M@@ is@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extre@@ me cau@@ tion when tra@@ vel@@ ing throughout the state given the series of ques@@ tion@@ able , rac@@ e@@ -@@ based inc@@ idents oc@@ curr@@ ing sta@@ te@@ wide recently , and noted there@@ in , &quot; the group &apos;s statement read@@ s .
a recent M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i law making it har@@ der for people to w@@ in discrimination law@@ su@@ its , as well as the state &apos;s law en@@ for@@ cement dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately tar@@ g@@ et@@ ing minorities pro@@ mp@@ ted the group to issue the travel al@@ er@@ t , the N@@ A@@ ACP said .
&quot; you have viol@@ ations of civil rights that are happening to people .
they &apos;@@ re being pu@@ ll@@ ed over because of their s@@ kin col@@ or , they &apos;@@ re being be@@ a@@ ten up or kill@@ ed , &quot; the presid@@ ent of the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i N@@ A@@ ACP , R@@ od Cha@@ pe@@ l , told The K@@ an@@ sa@@ s C@@ ity Sta@@ r .
&quot; we are hear@@ ing compla@@ ints at a rate we ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t heard before . &quot;
it is the first such war@@ ning that the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has issu@@ ed for a state in the US .
the group ci@@ ted inc@@ idents such as ra@@ cial s@@ lu@@ rs against b@@ lack stud@@ ents at the Uni@@ versity of M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ and@@ ers , 28 , a b@@ lack man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers di@@ ed under ques@@ tion@@ able circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while tra@@ vel@@ ing through the state , and was taken into cus@@ tod@@ y by M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i police without being acc@@ used of a crime .
the advis@@ ory also points to a recent report by the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i A@@ t@@ tor@@ ne@@ y General &apos;s Office show@@ ing that b@@ lack dri@@ vers in the state were 75 perc@@ ent more likely to be pu@@ ll@@ ed over than wh@@ ite@@ s .
&quot; the advis@@ ory is for people to be aware , and war@@ n their families and friends and co@@ -@@ workers of what could happen in M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i , &quot; Cha@@ pe@@ l said .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it &apos;s bringing b@@ ai@@ l money with them , or l@@ etting rela@@ tives know they are tra@@ vel@@ ing through the state . &quot;
M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i rec@@ ord@@ ed 100 ha@@ te crimes in 20@@ 15 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I &apos;s ha@@ te crime re@@ porting pro@@ gra@@ m , ran@@ king the state at 16@@ th in the country in terms of the number of such viol@@ ations .
the travel war@@ ning is also a response to a new M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a business for h@@ ous@@ ing or employment discrimination .
pre@@ viously , the American C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issu@@ ed travel advis@@ or@@ ies for T@@ ex@@ as and A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona after the states passed immigration en@@ for@@ cement laws requ@@ ir@@ ing local law en@@ for@@ cement to de@@ tain people on immigration viol@@ ations which the AC@@ L@@ U said would increase ra@@ cial prof@@ il@@ ing .
travel war@@ n@@ ings are us@@ u@@ ally issu@@ ed by the State D@@ e@@ part@@ ment for other countries , but la@@ tely , advoc@@ acy groups have res@@ or@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and tr@@ ends in@@ side the US .
Y@@ le : L@@ in@@ til@@ ä asked Fin@@ na@@ ir to clarify the C@@ E@@ O &apos;s additional pension
Y@@ le reports that M@@ ik@@ a L@@ in@@ til@@ ä ( C@@ entr@@ e Party ) , Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of Government ow@@ nership ste@@ ering , has asked Fin@@ na@@ ir to clarify the additional pension paid to C@@ E@@ O Pe@@ k@@ ka V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o .
according to L@@ in@@ til@@ ä , this is in conflict with the Government &apos;s defin@@ itions .
V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o &apos;s additional pension of EUR 13@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 h@@ it the ne@@ ws this week when Hel@@ sing@@ in S@@ anom@@ at re@@ ported on the development on inc@@ enti@@ ves paid to direc@@ tors of lis@@ ted companies .
Su@@ omen K@@ u@@ val@@ eh@@ ti re@@ ported on V@@ au@@ ra@@ m@@ o &apos;s additional pension in February .
Fin@@ na@@ ir announced its intention to dis@@ continue additional pensions in 20@@ 13 .
the Government has defined that no additional pensions should be used as inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the state hol@@ ds more than half of Fin@@ na@@ ir .
according to the company , this decision is in line with last year &apos;s decisi@@ on@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ principle on ow@@ nership ste@@ ering .
sanctions immediately resul@@ ted in he@@ ated talks
some time ago , it still seem@@ ed that US@@ -@@ Russia relations were turning from c@@ old to ho@@ t .
when meeting at the G@@ 20 summit in H@@ am@@ burg , D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p , the President of the USA , and V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ ir P@@ u@@ tin , the President of Russia , seem@@ ed to get along n@@ ic@@ ely .
later on , the relationship has become no@@ tably col@@ der .
Russia show@@ ed a b@@ itte@@ r response to the new economic sanctions approved last week by the US C@@ ong@@ ress and signed by tr@@ um@@ p on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
so far , the most s@@ tunn@@ ing response has been heard from Prime Minister D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ved@@ e@@ v who said that the sanctions b@@ ill signed by tr@@ um@@ p will result in a &quot; fu@@ ll@@ -@@ scale trade war . &quot;
even if the Russian respon@@ ses were sh@@ ru@@ g@@ ged off merely as ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations and ag@@ gra@@ vations bel@@ ong@@ ing to political r@@ het@@ or@@ ic , the increased ten@@ sion between the USA and Russia is a fact , following the short h@@ one@@ y@@ mo@@ on after tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s election .
in the USA , pass@@ ing the sanctions act concerning Russia , Iran and North Korea was no simple process .
then again , the US C@@ ong@@ ress was remar@@ ka@@ bly unanim@@ ous in pass@@ ing the b@@ ill . however , it was told that accep@@ ting the b@@ ill was much more difficult for the presid@@ ent .
soon after sig@@ ning the b@@ ill , tr@@ um@@ p critic@@ ised it as being &quot; signific@@ antly in@@ complete . &quot;
the sul@@ kin@@ ess of President tr@@ um@@ p was probably caused by Russia , even though it must have also felt dis@@ agre@@ e@@ able to sign a b@@ ill that limits the presid@@ ent &apos;s own power .
as is wid@@ ely known , the USA is investig@@ ating Russia &apos;s possible involvement in the presid@@ ential election and any lin@@ ks between tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign and Russia .
after a short h@@ one@@ y@@ mo@@ on , the relationship between the USA and Russia has turned decid@@ ed@@ ly col@@ der .
as the tur@@ no@@ ver of White House staff has been high and different s@@ cand@@ al@@ ous tw@@ ists and tur@@ ns have been re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ne@@ arly every day , it seems to be more appar@@ ent that US foreign policy is not run by the presid@@ ent , but regar@@ d@@ less of the presid@@ ent .
such a situation is in no sense a prefer@@ able one .
if the Russian relations are a tric@@ ky business in the USA , the same goes with the European Union .
in addition to economic sanctions , the inten@@ si@@ fied security situation in the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a region ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ s the relationship .
the EU has visi@@ bly highli@@ ghted the situation in Ukra@@ ine in its relationship with Russia and deman@@ ded the execu@@ tion of the M@@ ins@@ k Protocol .
even though the EU has remain@@ ed uni@@ fied , at least visi@@ bly , in its Russian policy , its member states have fair@@ ly differ@@ ing interests .
for a member state such as Fin@@ land that trad@@ es frequ@@ ently with Russia , economic sanctions are a constan@@ t nu@@ is@@ ance .
the impact of the new US sanctions act remains un@@ clear .
the EU has fe@@ ared that sanctions will make the life of many European companies difficult .
in Fin@@ land , the act may have an impact , for example , on the Nor@@ d S@@ tre@@ am 2 gas pi@@ p@@ elin@@ e project and the F@@ en@@ no@@ vo@@ im@@ a nuclear power pl@@ ant project .
another cause of s@@ our@@ ness in Europe is that li@@ qu@@ e@@ fied natural gas , which is important for US finan@@ ces , has been exclu@@ ded from the sanctions .
trade sanctions are a global way of show@@ ing dis@@ approval .
however , economic sanctions must be w@@ ell@@ -@@ considered and acc@@ ura@@ te ,
or they become har@@ m@@ ful rather than useful .
is nothing sa@@ c@@ red ?
now tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s White House is tar@@ g@@ et@@ ing the Sta@@ tu@@ e of Liber@@ ty
the su@@ rest mark of regime change is when they start atta@@ cking the sta@@ tu@@ es .
Americ@@ ans appreci@@ ate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully sta@@ ge@@ -@@ man@@ ged top@@ pl@@ ing of Saddam Hussein in F@@ ir@@ do@@ s s@@ qu@@ are in B@@ ag@@ hd@@ ad in 2003 .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en M@@ ill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ ol@@ o@@ gu@@ es of the tr@@ um@@ p regime , surely k@@ new what he was doing when he took a symb@@ ol@@ ic a@@ x@@ e to the Sta@@ tu@@ e of Liber@@ ty in a he@@ ated argument with C@@ N@@ N &apos;s J@@ im Ac@@ osta over the presid@@ ent &apos;s proposals to d@@ ras@@ tically limit legal immigration .
in fair@@ ness , M@@ ill@@ er did not attack the sta@@ tu@@ e itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ -@@ tri@@ p ow@@ ners and Liber@@ ty im@@ person@@ ators would have l@@ yn@@ ched him if he did .
but he did attack its mean@@ ing , and in particular the mean@@ ing as@@ cri@@ bed to it when E@@ m@@ ma La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s fam@@ ous po@@ e@@ m was added to its base in 19@@ 0@@ 3 , 17 years after the mon@@ u@@ ment itself was comple@@ ted .
as M@@ ill@@ er sc@@ ol@@ ded Ac@@ osta : &quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the Sta@@ tu@@ e of Liber@@ ty is ... a sym@@ bo@@ l of American liber@@ ty li@@ ghting the world .
the po@@ e@@ m that you &apos;@@ re referring to , that was added later and is not part of the original Sta@@ tu@@ e of Liber@@ ty . &quot;
M@@ ill@@ er is fac@@ tually correct , but as he put it him@@ self , this is not really about history .
it is about the con@@ temporary res@@ on@@ ance of La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s star@@ t@@ ling words , the only ones in which a state has appe@@ ared to inv@@ ite not just any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your ti@@ red , your poor , / Y@@ our hu@@ d@@ d@@ led m@@ ass@@ es ye@@ ar@@ ning to brea@@ the free , / The w@@ re@@ t@@ ched ref@@ use of your te@@ em@@ ing shor@@ e . &quot;
there has never been a time when the &quot; w@@ re@@ t@@ ched ref@@ use &quot; has been more visi@@ ble on our s@@ cre@@ ens .
M@@ ill@@ er was not eng@@ ag@@ ing in li@@ ter@@ ary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s USA .
this conflict about the mean@@ ing of a sta@@ tu@@ e is part of a wid@@ er political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the mean@@ ing of America .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us - and her friends who campa@@ ig@@ ned to place her words at the base after her death - k@@ new very well that they were eng@@ ag@@ ing in a highly political act .
the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was intended to mark the connec@@ tions between French and American re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an@@ ism by repres@@ enting in a w@@ ell@@ -@@ wor@@ n classi@@ cal tro@@ pe , the f@@ em@@ ale emb@@ od@@ im@@ ent of Liber@@ ty .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us changed that mean@@ ing : in her po@@ e@@ m the f@@ em@@ ale figure is no longer ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t - she has a voice .
and she gives her@@ self a very different name : mo@@ ther of Ex@@ il@@ es .
the mar@@ rying of the po@@ e@@ m to the im@@ age is a bri@@ lli@@ ant f@@ em@@ inis@@ t cou@@ p and a dev@@ asta@@ ting attack on American na@@ ti@@ vis@@ m .
and just as La@@ z@@ ar@@ us changed the mean@@ ing of the sta@@ tu@@ e , ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ing@@ ers have long wanted to change it back .
the great lou@@ d@@ mouth Rus@@ h L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh , a kind of Joh@@ n the B@@ ap@@ tis@@ t for the coming of tr@@ um@@ p , argu@@ ed in 2010 that Liber@@ ty is not inv@@ iting anyone in , but is rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , taking the American fla@@ me out to the ben@@ i@@ ghted world : &quot; la@@ d@@ y Liber@@ ty is ste@@ pp@@ ing forward .
she is me@@ ant to be car@@ rying the tor@@ ch of liber@@ ty from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to light the way to the United States . &quot;
rather un@@ us@@ u@@ ally , L@@ im@@ b@@ au@@ gh actually h@@ it on something .
the mean@@ ing of the sta@@ tu@@ e is entirely a matter of the ang@@ le of perc@@ ep@@ tion .
La@@ z@@ ar@@ us &apos;s great imag@@ in@@ ative act was to see it as it would be seen by ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , w@@ re@@ t@@ ched but h@@ ope@@ ful people on the dec@@ ks of ships after long and often d@@ read@@ ful jour@@ ne@@ ys .
it is li@@ ter@@ ally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refu@@ ge and a chance to better their lives .
her sta@@ tu@@ e spea@@ ks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective M@@ ill@@ er and tr@@ um@@ p want ever to recognise .
their tor@@ ch is me@@ ant not to light the way , but to inf@@ la@@ me the ha@@ tre@@ ds that are their only source of power .

a record number of Scot@@ t@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have been selec@@ ted for L@@ on@@ d@@ on 20@@ 17 , which star@@ ts on F@@ rid@@ ay .
b@@ lack believes &quot; there &apos;s something special ev@@ ol@@ ving &quot; in Scot@@ land and UK a@@ th@@ le@@ tics must learn from that .
&quot; we emb@@ ra@@ ce it and we &apos;@@ re trying to understand it and we &apos;@@ l@@ l pus@@ h on that until we work it out , &quot; B@@ lack said .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scot@@ t@@ ish In@@ stitu@@ te of S@@ port and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
Scot@@ t@@ ish A@@ th@@ le@@ tics think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
British a@@ th@@ le@@ tics : it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
and the gu@@ y on the cor@@ ner stre@@ et , too .
whatever the comb@@ ination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely bri@@ lli@@ ant . &quot;
several of the Scot@@ t@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are med@@ al con@@ ten@@ ders , including La@@ ur@@ a M@@ u@@ ir and An@@ dre@@ w B@@ ut@@ char@@ t - who will ra@@ ce against S@@ ir M@@ o F@@ ar@@ a@@ h in the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ m , while E@@ il@@ id@@ h D@@ o@@ y@@ le was voted by the s@@ qu@@ ad to be te@@ am cap@@ tain .
&quot; E@@ il@@ id@@ h is sli@@ ghtly mod@@ est .
her cap@@ tain &apos;s speech was inc@@ redi@@ ble , &quot; says B@@ lack .
&quot; a number of a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , whether they were Scot@@ t@@ ish or wh@@ er@@ ever they live or tra@@ in , w@@ al@@ ked out of that room feel@@ ing hu@@ g@@ ely pro@@ ud and really mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted .
the pas@@ sion and real feel@@ ing that E@@ il@@ id@@ h naturally put into it were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ we@@ alth sil@@ ver med@@ all@@ ist , who will compet@@ e in the 4@@ 00@@ m h@@ ur@@ d@@ les at her fif@@ th World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships , says it &apos;s &quot; inc@@ redi@@ ble &quot; 16 S@@ co@@ ts are in the British te@@ am .
Scot@@ land &apos;s previous best total of a@@ th@@ le@@ tes at the wor@@ l@@ ds was s@@ even , achieved in 198@@ 3 and 20@@ 15 .
M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ dis@@ tance run@@ ner M@@ u@@ ir is leading the way , having set five British and two European rec@@ or@@ ds in the past year .
she will go in the 15@@ 00@@ m and the 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ m .
Ch@@ r@@ is O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who run@@ s in the 15@@ 00@@ m , is another S@@ co@@ t to w@@ at@@ ch , following a great se@@ as@@ on that included vic@@ tory at the British T@@ e@@ am tri@@ als and the An@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary G@@ am@@ es .
D@@ o@@ y@@ le re@@ members her first world cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships , when the only other S@@ co@@ t in the te@@ am was L@@ ee Mc@@ C@@ onn@@ el@@ l .
the te@@ am cap@@ tain says she &apos;s &quot; hu@@ g@@ ely pro@@ ud &quot; of the fact so many of her comp@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ ts have not only made the te@@ am , but , in some cases , will be challeng@@ ing for med@@ als and compet@@ ing to make fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being te@@ am cap@@ tain is that it was voted for by the other members of the te@@ am , so that it was such a huge hon@@ our any@@ way but to know that your te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes have voted for you and ch@@ os@@ en you made it extra@@ -@@ special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I &apos;@@ m very pro@@ ud of all the S@@ co@@ ts who &apos;@@ ve made the te@@ am .
it just shows how far we &apos;@@ ve come .
and they &apos;@@ re here as w@@ ell@@ -@@ established a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , a@@ th@@ le@@ tes that are going to be looking to get on po@@ di@@ u@@ ms .
as for my cap@@ tain &apos;s speech ?
Y@@ e@@ a@@ h , I think it w@@ ent well .
I just dre@@ w on the fact that we &apos;@@ re very lu@@ ck@@ y in this situation in that we &apos;@@ ve got a home World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships .
so it &apos;s really just the importance of drawing on that home support and th@@ ri@@ ving on the fact that we &apos;@@ re back at the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic Sta@@ di@@ um .
I &apos;@@ m getting a second chance to go out there and compet@@ e and it &apos;s just going to be such an a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here out there . &quot;
b@@ loc@@ king critic@@ s from F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok : d@@ on &apos;@@ t run for public office , if you can &apos;@@ t take he@@ at from vo@@ ters
the fa@@ ther of our country k@@ new something about bad press .
Americ@@ ans lo@@ ved Geor@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , but it d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t take long for new@@ s@@ paper@@ s to start s@@ la@@ m@@ ming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
he cha@@ f@@ ed at the criticism , sure .
but he did not sil@@ ence his critic@@ s .
because back in 17@@ 8@@ 3 , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton said , &quot; the freedom of speech may be taken away - and , d@@ um@@ b &a@@ mp@@ ; sil@@ ent we may be led , like sh@@ e@@ ep , to the s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter . &quot;
that br@@ ings me to Mar@@ yl@@ and Go@@ v@@ . L@@ ar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work on being more like W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton .
H@@ og@@ an &apos;s staff has b@@ loc@@ ked and del@@ e@@ ted the pos@@ ts of at least 4@@ 50 people who vo@@ ic@@ ed their opinions on his official F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok pa@@ ge .
and the American C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him for that earlier this week .
the govern@@ or &apos;s staff dis@@ mis@@ sed the law@@ su@@ it as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the on@@ line com@@ mentary was rich with a &quot; who car@@ es ? &quot; bac@@ kl@@ as@@ h .
&quot; it &apos;s only F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok , &quot; pl@@ enty of f@@ ol@@ ks said .
but it matters .
and it especially matters when it &apos;s a gu@@ y like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an govern@@ or in an over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly Democ@@ ratic state who is as@@ ton@@ is@@ h@@ ingly pop@@ ular .
he has the secon@@ d@@ -@@ highest approval ra@@ ting of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reac@@ tionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
he &apos;s shown a ste@@ ad@@ y hand in leading his state and a ster@@ n ad@@ her@@ ence to principles .
he &apos;s also been pre@@ tty de@@ ft at using F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok as a primary means to connec@@ t with his constitu@@ ents , pla@@ y@@ fully deb@@ u@@ ting his ha@@ ir@@ less head after chem@@ o treat@@ ments on his pa@@ ge .
so b@@ loc@@ king people who come to the govern@@ or &apos;s pa@@ ge - which is a public for@@ um , lab@@ el@@ ed as official and ad@@ minis@@ tered by staff members paid public tax doll@@ ars - is un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an inter@@ view with The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , H@@ og@@ an spo@@ kes@@ w@@ oman A@@ mel@@ ia C@@ has@@ se def@@ en@@ ded the govern@@ or &apos;s actions , argu@@ ing that b@@ loc@@ king the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the im@@ age of tro@@ ll@@ s or s@@ pa@@ m@@ m@@ ers or ha@@ te@@ ful f@@ ol@@ ks las@@ hing out on@@ line .
the P@@ ost tal@@ ked to some of the real people b@@ loc@@ ked by H@@ og@@ an .
and they &apos;@@ re just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a te@@ ac@@ her , a business ow@@ ner and a pas@@ tor , not tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and not prof@@ an@@ e .
the pas@@ tor quo@@ ted the B@@ i@@ ble in his post , appe@@ al@@ ing to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic fa@@ it@@ h .
A@@ t@@ tor@@ ne@@ y L@@ a@@ ks@@ h@@ mi S@@ ar@@ ma R@@ aman@@ i of Bo@@ wi@@ e , M@@ d . , w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t ha@@ te@@ ful , but she asked about ha@@ te crimes .
&quot; I poli@@ tely com@@ men@@ ted that I was disap@@ pointed in his lack of response to ha@@ te crimes and other recent ne@@ ws ite@@ ms , &quot; she w@@ ro@@ te in the comment sec@@ tion of The P@@ ost &apos;s ne@@ ws s@@ tory .
&quot; I also do not appreci@@ ate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same to@@ pi@@ c , they are immediately dis@@ regar@@ ded by some as a so@@ -@@ called collective effort , rather than rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed as a large group of concerned citizens . &quot;
what the govern@@ or &apos;s staff called a &quot; concent@@ rated s@@ pa@@ m attack &quot; others would probably call &quot; advoc@@ acy . &quot;
the F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok er@@ a makes it easy to ta@@ il@@ or a message by simply b@@ loc@@ king a cr@@ iti@@ c or del@@ et@@ ing a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot cle@@ an@@ er than the old days , when doing the same would have required sen@@ ding staff out to collec@@ t and bur@@ n new@@ s@@ paper@@ s with critical ed@@ itor@@ i@@ als or ar@@ res@@ ting and sil@@ enc@@ ing prote@@ s@@ ters .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening , only dig@@ ita@@ lly .
H@@ og@@ an is@@ n &apos;@@ t the first public official to be critic@@ iz@@ ed for def@@ ang@@ ing F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok and other social media .
President tr@@ um@@ p is being su@@ ed by T@@ wit@@ ter users who were b@@ loc@@ ked from his T@@ wit@@ ter feed .
one of the first lan@@ d@@ mark r@@ ul@@ ings on this issue came down last week in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
the cha@@ ir of the L@@ ou@@ d@@ ou@@ n Coun@@ ty Bo@@ ard of super@@ vis@@ ors viol@@ ated the F@@ ir@@ st Amendment , according to U@@ .@@ S@@ . D@@ is@@ tric@@ t J@@ ud@@ ge J@@ am@@ es C@@ . C@@ ac@@ her@@ is in A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ria , when she bann@@ ed a constitu@@ ent from her F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok pa@@ ge .
and in K@@ en@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , Go@@ v@@ . M@@ at@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) also got a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U over his use of F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok and T@@ wit@@ ter .
this sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be so hard .
in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s time , the er@@ a of affor@@ d@@ able pos@@ ta@@ ge had an impact much like the Internet .
the number of new@@ s@@ paper@@ s qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ed between 17@@ 7@@ 6 and 18@@ 00 , and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous letter w@@ ri@@ ters ha@@ m@@ mer@@ ed his lead@@ ership .
and even back then , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton had an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous tro@@ ll@@ s .
people using the p@@ se@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ ms &quot; J@@ ur@@ ic@@ ol@@ a , &quot; &quot; Val@@ er@@ i@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ ar@@ i@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; all w@@ ro@@ te let@@ ters to new@@ s@@ paper@@ s tras@@ hing W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s decisions .
P@@ et@@ itions critic@@ iz@@ ing his stand on the Treaty of am@@ ity , Com@@ mer@@ ce , and Na@@ vi@@ g@@ ation with Bri@@ tain over@@ wh@@ el@@ med his office , according to the histor@@ ical documents collec@@ ted by the on@@ line Pa@@ per@@ s of Geor@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton Pro@@ ject .
but he did not sil@@ ence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and dis@@ course li@@ e at the very found@@ ation of our nation .
and true lead@@ ership means accep@@ ting that .
sum@@ mer b@@ ir@@ d fe@@ eding should be sto@@ pped at once
&quot; we have received sa@@ mp@@ les from rou@@ gh@@ ly five loc@@ ations and on@@ line reports from two to three places .
most of these are from southern and sou@@ th@@ -@@ w@@ estern Fin@@ land , but there are also individual reports from H@@ a@@ a@@ pa@@ ves@@ i and Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki , &quot; says sen@@ i@@ or res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er Mar@@ ja I@@ s@@ om@@ urs@@ u from the F@@ inn@@ ish F@@ ood S@@ af@@ ety Authority ( E@@ vir@@ a ) .

caused by a par@@ as@@ ite called T@@ ric@@ hom@@ on@@ as g@@ all@@ in@@ a@@ e .
it has been known to inf@@ ec@@ t do@@ ves , particularly pi@@ ge@@ ons .
in the 200@@ 0@@ s , the disease was also dis@@ covered in fin@@ ches .
the most dev@@ asta@@ ting ne@@ ws was heard in 200@@ 9
when tric@@ hom@@ on@@ i@@ asi@@ s signific@@ antly reduced the number of European gre@@ en@@ fin@@ ches in Fin@@ land , after which the spec@@ ies has s@@ low@@ ly rec@@ over@@ ed .
&quot; we have seen evidence of dis@@ e@@ ased European gre@@ en@@ fin@@ ches , but not on a large scale , at least not yet , &quot; says J@@ uh@@ a H@@ on@@ k@@ al@@ a , sen@@ i@@ or m@@ use@@ um techn@@ ic@@ ian at the F@@ inn@@ ish M@@ use@@ um of Na@@ tural H@@ is@@ tory .
&quot; we fear that the previous ep@@ idem@@ ics will rec@@ ur , unless we do something .
what we need to do is very simple : everyone must stop sum@@ mer b@@ ir@@ d fe@@ eding at once . &quot;
more ne@@ ws will be rele@@ ased later .

&quot; I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t get to defend the Ex@@ tre@@ ma@@ d@@ ur@@ a O@@ p@@ en because that was taken off the sch@@ edu@@ le the year after I w@@ on it .

&quot; it always means a little bit more when you &apos;@@ re playing at home , &quot; said Hel@@ ens@@ bur@@ gh man Or@@ r .
&quot; you want to do well ; but you do feel that ex@@ tra pressure .
I &apos;@@ ve really enjo@@ yed playing again and I &apos;@@ ve played some sol@@ id g@@ ol@@ f .

possible in@@ do@@ or climate problems investig@@ ated in S@@ ä@@ ky@@ l@@ ä
the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade has re@@ ported that , so far , no in@@ do@@ or climate problems have been dis@@ covered in the building of the sig@@ n@@ als company in S@@ ä@@ ky@@ l@@ ä .
investig@@ ations are still in progress .
the investig@@ ations started after a man had to inter@@ rup@@ t his military service as he sus@@ pec@@ ted that his state of health de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated due to the poor in@@ do@@ or climate at the bar@@ rac@@ ks .
according to li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant col@@ on@@ el M@@ ik@@ a H@@ ol@@ ma , ch@@ i@@ ef of staff of the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade , there have been no problems regarding the health of other con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts .
&quot; it turned out that this was a separate inc@@ ident , and no other con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts ser@@ ving in the same uni@@ t have experienc@@ ed any problems .
we take every report seriously , and we wanted to thorou@@ gh@@ ly investig@@ ate this case .
currently , we are not aware of any in@@ do@@ or climate problem , &quot; H@@ ol@@ ma says .
the press rele@@ ase issu@@ ed by the Por@@ i Bri@@ g@@ ade says that it was necessary to re@@ loc@@ ate some material to the bar@@ rac@@ ks to make room for new con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts in July , which may have increased the v@@ olu@@ me of d@@ ust tempor@@ arily .
&quot; the air may have felt stu@@ ff@@ y because of this , &quot; H@@ ol@@ ma says .

when Bar@@ d@@ ina D@@ eg@@ ei co@@ o@@ ks d@@ inn@@ er , she do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t use a sto@@ ve .
she r@@ ar@@ ely even uses a po@@ t .
in her w@@ o@@ od@@ en home in En@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i , the capital of P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i reg@@ ency in the res@@ tive Indon@@ es@@ ian prov@@ in@@ ce of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a , the hou@@ se@@ wi@@ f@@ e us@@ u@@ ally just places a s@@ we@@ et po@@ ta@@ to - known loc@@ ally as &quot; no@@ ta &quot; - directly into the fi@@ re@@ place .

in fact , P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i suffer@@ ed a n@@ ad@@ ir just two months after J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i &apos;s October in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration .

a cou@@ ple of hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by government E@@ lec@@ tion Commission building was set ab@@ la@@ z@@ e , and things es@@ cal@@ ated the following day .
about 1@@ ,@@ 000 young P@@ a@@ pu@@ an men , women and children ga@@ ther@@ ed on a so@@ cc@@ er field in fron@@ t of the local police sta@@ tion and military comm@@ and cen@@ ter to demand justice .

some prote@@ s@@ ters started h@@ ur@@ ling s@@ ton@@ es at police and military pos@@ ts .

the P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Pol@@ ice C@@ hi@@ ef In@@ spec@@ tor General Y@@ ot@@ j@@ e M@@ en@@ de told re@@ por@@ ters that his offic@@ ers were only &quot; sec@@ uring &quot; their sta@@ tion because it was under attack .
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threa@@ ten to k@@ ill us , &quot; P@@ a@@ pu@@ a Pol@@ ice spo@@ kes@@ person , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ y@@ o said in 20@@ 15 .
&quot; it &apos;s a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Wat@@ ch , five young prote@@ s@@ ters were kill@@ ed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
ne@@ ws of the kill@@ ings only fil@@ tered through to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta the following day .
three weeks later , J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i gave an imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed speech in J@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ pur@@ a , where he expressed sym@@ pa@@ th@@ ies with the victims &apos; families and vo@@ wed to address the historic ab@@ uses in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a .
&quot; I want this case to be sol@@ ved immediately so it w@@ on &apos;@@ t ever happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 20@@ 16 that he was setting up a n@@ on@@ -@@ judicial mechanism to sett@@ le historic human@@ -@@ rights viol@@ ations .
but the ex@@ cus@@ es started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the viol@@ ations oc@@ cur@@ red a long time ago .
some were in the &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s and in early 200@@ 0@@ s .
the point is we are committed to addres@@ sing these viol@@ ations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; he said .
then W@@ ir@@ an@@ to back@@ trac@@ ked when speaking to time in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on June 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ance mechanism in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a .
instead , &quot; Al@@ l will be sett@@ led by law , &quot; he said .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who the U@@ .@@ N@@ . has indic@@ ted for &quot; crimes against human@@ ity &quot; relating to more than 1@@ ,@@ 000 de@@ a@@ ths during East T@@ im@@ or &apos;s blo@@ ody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human@@ -@@ rights viol@@ ations in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a have already been sett@@ led , including the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i inc@@ ident .
families of the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i victims gre@@ e@@ ted such claim@@ s with g@@ ri@@ m inc@@ re@@ d@@ ul@@ ity .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been inter@@ vie@@ wed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , &quot; Y@@ o@@ han@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m af@@ ra@@ id , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m af@@ ra@@ id of being ar@@ res@@ ted by the military , af@@ ra@@ id to be sho@@ t . &quot;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us ec@@ ho@@ ed the view that people in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i are fe@@ ar@@ ful of discussing the inc@@ ident .
he says he was be@@ a@@ ten by the military after helping to bur@@ y four of the victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t sto@@ pped .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , Indon@@ es@@ ian police sho@@ t at vill@@ ag@@ ers in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i &apos;s neigh@@ bor@@ ing D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i reg@@ ency .
one person di@@ ed and 17 others were w@@ oun@@ ded , including children , during a conf@@ ron@@ tation between vill@@ ag@@ ers and the manag@@ er of a construction company who ref@@ used to help transport an un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous man to h@@ os@@ p@@ ital .

police said the vill@@ ag@@ ers thre@@ w ro@@ cks at offic@@ ers , who respon@@ ded by fir@@ ing war@@ ning sho@@ ts .
but loc@@ als say the mo@@ b@@ ile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ es@@ ian par@@ am@@ ili@@ tary police ) beg@@ an sho@@ ot@@ ing at the cro@@ w@@ d , kill@@ ing one .
&quot; we were so pan@@ ic@@ ked , we are af@@ ra@@ id there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old D@@ om@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ ad@@ i@@ i , who lives ne@@ ar the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital and wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the in@@ ju@@ red being h@@ ur@@ ried in , tell@@ s time .
&quot; I have been hid@@ ing in my house for two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i parlia@@ ment has called for the offic@@ ers involved to be held to account and the police mo@@ b@@ ile bri@@ g@@ ade to be with@@ drawn from the area .
P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i has always been a tro@@ ub@@ l@@ es@@ po@@ t for the Indon@@ es@@ ian government .
the lack of mean@@ ing@@ ful development fe@@ ed@@ s the dis@@ content of the tri@@ b@@ al M@@ ee , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani , and D@@ a@@ mal peoples , who live sp@@ ra@@ w@@ led across P@@ a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s ver@@ d@@ ant central hi@@ gh@@ lands .

some of the top O@@ P@@ M leaders ha@@ il from P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i , including T@@ ad@@ i@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Dan@@ i@@ el Y@@ ud@@ as K@@ o@@ go@@ y@@ a .
in response , thousands of people in P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i have been ar@@ res@@ ted and ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ arily de@@ tained by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of &quot; safe@@ guar@@ ding national soverei@@ gn@@ ty . &quot;
some never re@@ appear .
among the people of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a , P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i is known as &quot; a tragic , for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten place . &quot;
poverty fe@@ ed@@ s the dis@@ content .
the little ric@@ e on s@@ ale in En@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i is too expen@@ sive for loc@@ als to bu@@ y .
bre@@ ad is just as out of reach .
people here gro@@ w everything they e@@ at : mainly no@@ ta plu@@ s some fru@@ it and le@@ af@@ y ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
farming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the s@@ we@@ et po@@ ta@@ to .
they us@@ u@@ ally keep most of the har@@ v@@ est for the family , with the rest sol@@ d in the local market .
ten pi@@ ec@@ es of no@@ ta cost only 10@@ ,@@ 000 Indon@@ es@@ ian ru@@ pi@@ a@@ h ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qu@@ alities have gro@@ wn between the na@@ tive P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans and the new mi@@ grants , who have arri@@ ved in greater num@@ bers since the opening of a new air rou@@ tes to N@@ ab@@ ire A@@ ir@@ port .
what few jobs exist typ@@ ically go to the bet@@ ter@@ -@@ educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er mi@@ grants .
P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans r@@ ar@@ ely have the capital or the necessary s@@ kill@@ s to run their own businesses compet@@ iti@@ vely .
&quot; the young people are not interested to sta@@ y in the vill@@ age ... because there &apos;s no jobs or money here , &quot; says Joh@@ n G@@ ob@@ a@@ i , the chairman of the tri@@ b@@ al coun@@ cil of P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i .
is@@ ol@@ ation ke@@ ep@@ s the world &apos;s e@@ yes off P@@ a@@ pu@@ a .
in addition , re@@ porting restrictions for international media remain ti@@ ght .
earlier this year , French jour@@ n@@ alists Fran@@ ck E@@ sc@@ u@@ di@@ e and B@@ asi@@ lle L@@ ong@@ cha@@ m@@ p were de@@ ported from P@@ a@@ pu@@ a for a &quot; lack of coordination with related institutions &quot; despite having been granted r@@ are per@@ mission to fil@@ m .
according to P@@ h@@ eli@@ m K@@ ine , D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty A@@ sia Direc@@ tor of Human Rights Wat@@ ch , J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i &apos;s election campaign ple@@ d@@ ges to li@@ ft re@@ porting restrictions to bo@@ ost transparency and development have not been re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed .
&quot; there are new ha@@ z@@ ards for foreign jour@@ n@@ alists attemp@@ ting to report from Indon@@ es@@ ia &apos;s res@@ tive eas@@ ter@@ n@@ most prov@@ inc@@ es of P@@ a@@ pu@@ a and W@@ est P@@ a@@ pu@@ a : v@@ isa den@@ ial and bla@@ ck@@ lis@@ ting , &quot; he said in a statement .
the lack of press scru@@ tin@@ y means international pressure on the Indon@@ es@@ ian government has been largely limited to P@@ a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors .
in March , six P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic nations - T@@ ong@@ a , Na@@ ur@@ u , P@@ ala@@ u , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ shall Is@@ lands , and the Sol@@ om@@ on Is@@ lands - ur@@ ged the U@@ .@@ N@@ . Human Rights Council to investig@@ ate the &quot; various and wid@@ es@@ pread viol@@ ations &quot; in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a , including the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing .
these same countries have histor@@ ically bac@@ ked the O@@ P@@ M .
Indon@@ es@@ ian Foreign Minis@@ try spo@@ kes@@ person Ar@@ r@@ man@@ a@@ th@@ a N@@ asi@@ r sh@@ ru@@ g@@ ged off the group &apos;s all@@ eg@@ ations , tell@@ ing jour@@ n@@ alists in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , &quot; I@@ n Indon@@ es@@ ia , a democratic system still applies and there &apos;s free media so it &apos;s hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , head@@ ed by the nation &apos;s human rights amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or K@@ e@@ es Van B@@ a@@ ar , visi@@ ted J@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ pur@@ a on May 4 , local people bro@@ ke their sil@@ ence , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing , &quot; W@@ e want freedom , &quot; according to a source who also atten@@ ded the meeting but who asked to sta@@ y an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Indon@@ es@@ ia has another presid@@ ential election in 20@@ 19 , but P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans say they are un@@ likely to vote again for J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i .
&quot; J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but he is sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by the people who are involved in the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ a@@ i , the tri@@ b@@ al coun@@ cil chairman .
he wants J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i to know that the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i people , asi@@ de from living under the lo@@ om@@ ing threat of a rap@@ ac@@ ious military , w@@ allow in des@@ titu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ a@@ i says the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i people , like other P@@ a@@ pu@@ ans , consider their vote to J@@ o@@ ko@@ w@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; he must re@@ pay .
&quot; they d@@ on &apos;@@ t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the P@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ i sho@@ ot@@ ing victims carried out one last symb@@ ol@@ ic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : bur@@ ying one victi@@ m &apos;s body on land just opposite the police and military sta@@ tion .
know@@ ing that justice may never be ser@@ ved , at least they w@@ on &apos;@@ t let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been kill@@ ed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , head b@@ ow@@ ed .
&quot; what else could we do ? &quot;
D@@ er@@ ec@@ k C@@ his@@ or@@ a attacks R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Hel@@ eni@@ us for canc@@ elling their re@@ mat@@ ch : &quot; not even his f@@ ans want to see him fight &quot;
he@@ av@@ y@@ w@@ eight bo@@ x@@ ers R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Hel@@ eni@@ us and D@@ er@@ ec@@ k C@@ his@@ or@@ a were set to fight at Har@@ tw@@ all Ar@@ ena on 27 May .
however , the fight was can@@ cell@@ ed for commercial reasons .
in a recent inter@@ view for I@@ F@@ L T@@ V , C@@ his@@ or@@ a la@@ ys all the bla@@ me on Hel@@ eni@@ us for the can@@ cell@@ ation .
&quot; my fight in Fin@@ land was can@@ cell@@ ed , but I &apos;@@ m not the one to bla@@ me .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t live in Fin@@ land ; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to sel@@ l my tic@@ ket@@ s there .
the reason was my F@@ inn@@ ish op@@ pon@@ ent .
he &apos;s so bad that not even his f@@ ans want to see him fight , &quot; C@@ his@@ or@@ a pre@@ ac@@ hes .
Hel@@ eni@@ us and C@@ his@@ or@@ a had their first fight at a fully pac@@ ked Har@@ tw@@ all Ar@@ ena in December 20@@ 11 .
the jud@@ ges contro@@ versi@@ ally declar@@ ed Hel@@ eni@@ us as the w@@ inn@@ er .
tic@@ ket sal@@ es for the re@@ mat@@ ch were s@@ low , and promo@@ ter N@@ is@@ se S@@ au@@ er@@ land told I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at in May that the fight was post@@ pon@@ ed to autu@@ m@@ n .
no ne@@ ws of the mat@@ ch was heard ever since .
however , C@@ his@@ or@@ a is no longer sor@@ ry about the can@@ cell@@ ation .
as it happens , the fight would have been can@@ cell@@ ed any@@ way , as C@@ his@@ or@@ a was ill .
&quot; on Th@@ urs@@ day , three days before the fight , I was w@@ ok@@ en by an inten@@ se pain .
my her@@ nia was about to b@@ low up .
at h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , they told me that I needed sur@@ ger@@ y , &quot; C@@ his@@ or@@ a says .
C@@ his@@ or@@ a says that he is 45 per cent f@@ it right now .
he does not seem to be interested in a re@@ mat@@ ch with Hel@@ eni@@ us , as he has his e@@ yes set on D@@ ill@@ ian W@@ hy@@ te .

it &apos;s the second bla@@ z@@ e to s@@ wee@@ p through the hi@@ gh@@ -@@ rise - which happens to be called the tor@@ ch to@@ wer - in just two years .
the building was e@@ va@@ cu@@ ated , no in@@ j@@ uri@@ es were re@@ ported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the bla@@ z@@ e .
&quot; we were s@@ le@@ eping and we w@@ o@@ ke up to the fir@@ e al@@ arm and people s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing .
we ran down the sta@@ ir@@ s and it took us about 10 minu@@ tes to reach from the 5@@ 0@@ th floor , &quot; a resid@@ ent who gave his name as Geor@@ ge told Re@@ u@@ ters .
D@@ ub@@ a@@ i &apos;s civil defence authorities said fi@@ re@@ fighting s@@ qu@@ ads put out the bla@@ z@@ e at around 4@@ .00 am local time ( 00@@ 00 G@@ M@@ T ) and were co@@ ol@@ ing the building .
the government said it was working on providing sh@@ el@@ ter for those affected .
the inc@@ ident may re@@ vi@@ ve questions about the safety of materi@@ als used on the ex@@ teri@@ ors of tal@@ l buil@@ dings across the world .
an investig@@ ation by the management of the tor@@ ch after its 20@@ 15 fir@@ e found that most of the damage was to the cla@@ d@@ ding , ex@@ teri@@ or pan@@ elling used for dec@@ or@@ ation or in@@ su@@ lation .
in the UK , police have said they believe the system of in@@ su@@ lation and cla@@ d@@ ding pan@@ els on L@@ on@@ d@@ on &apos;s G@@ ren@@ fel@@ l T@@ ow@@ er may have contribu@@ ted to the rapid s@@ pread of a fir@@ e there in June in which some 80 people di@@ ed .

the m@@ op@@ ed was st@@ olen from T@@ ik@@ ka@@ m@@ ä@@ enti@@ e 2 in N@@ i@@ in@@ i@@ va@@ ar@@ a .

ed@@ ited at 12 : 40 p@@ m on 3 A@@ ug@@ ust 20@@ 17 : the police re@@ ported that the m@@ op@@ ed has been found .
more than 1 in 5 US tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers carry prohi@@ bi@@ ted ite@@ ms on@@ to air@@ craft , sur@@ ve@@ y fin@@ ds
a sur@@ ve@@ y of air@@ line passeng@@ ers found that more than 20 per cent had know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led prohi@@ bi@@ ted ite@@ ms past the US Trans@@ por@@ tation Security A@@ d@@ ministra@@ tion chec@@ k@@ points on@@ to the air@@ craft , including at least 6 per cent who bo@@ ar@@ ded the plan@@ e while un@@ inten@@ tion@@ ally car@@ rying prohi@@ bi@@ ted k@@ ni@@ ves or other bla@@ ded objec@@ ts .
less than 1 per cent claim@@ ed that they dis@@ covered bel@@ a@@ tedly that they had mis@@ ta@@ ken@@ ly tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed with fi@@ re@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the sur@@ ve@@ y of more than 1@@ 000 people - which was conduc@@ ted by a j@@ et@@ -@@ char@@ tering service S@@ tra@@ to@@ s J@@ et Char@@ ters In@@ c . - also found that youn@@ ger tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers were more likely to f@@ l@@ out the rules .
of the respon@@ d@@ ents who ad@@ mitted know@@ ingly trying to f@@ ly with something bann@@ ed by the T@@ S@@ A , 19@@ .@@ 7 per cent were mill@@ en@@ ni@@ als , compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of G@@ ener@@ ation X .
the most common ite@@ ms wh@@ is@@ ked past T@@ S@@ A ag@@ ents on purpose were food and li@@ qu@@ id@@ s .
more than 3 per cent ad@@ mitted know@@ ingly car@@ rying bla@@ ded ite@@ ms past security , while 2@@ .@@ 2 per cent of f@@ em@@ ale respon@@ d@@ ents and 3@@ .@@ 7 per cent of m@@ ale respon@@ d@@ ents also acknowled@@ ged inten@@ tion@@ ally car@@ rying prohi@@ bi@@ ted drugs on@@ to the air@@ craft .
the company said it sur@@ ve@@ yed tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers around the country to find out how many had acc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly brought contra@@ b@@ and through air@@ port security and how many had done so on purpose .
it &apos;s no surpris@@ e that the people most likely to ha@@ u@@ l contra@@ b@@ and past security - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - were those who f@@ ly the most .
as the company points out , however , the T@@ S@@ A guidelines are somewhat compl@@ icated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain of what li@@ qu@@ id@@ s they can carry or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surpris@@ e that the larg@@ est amount of stu@@ ff se@@ iz@@ ed by the T@@ S@@ A happens to be for@@ b@@ id@@ den li@@ qu@@ id@@ s .
for a time , people thought the T@@ S@@ A might be tre@@ ating bo@@ o@@ ks as contra@@ b@@ and .
li@@ qu@@ id@@ s are allowed on domestic f@@ li@@ ghts , but not on international ones .
E@@ P@@ A C@@ hi@@ ef P@@ ru@@ it@@ t back@@ trac@@ ks on Del@@ a@@ ying O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ E@@ ra Rules to reduce E@@ mis@@ sions
one day after getting su@@ ed by 15 states , Environ@@ mental Pro@@ te@@ c@@ tion Agency ch@@ i@@ ef Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t re@@ ver@@ sed his earlier decision to delay implementation of O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ er@@ a rules reducing emissions of smo@@ g@@ -@@ ca@@ using air pollu@@ tants .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t presented the change as his agency being more respon@@ sive than past administra@@ tions to the needs of state environmental regula@@ tors .
he made no mention of the legal challenge f@@ iled against his pri@@ or position in a feder@@ al appe@@ als court .
at issue is an Oc@@ t@@ . 1 dead@@ line for states to begin meeting 20@@ 15 standards for gro@@ und@@ -@@ level o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; inter@@ fer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ ding economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who was O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ oma &apos;s state at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y general pri@@ or to his ap@@ poin@@ tment by President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p , has long ser@@ ved as a reli@@ able op@@ pon@@ ent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
since arri@@ ving in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t has repe@@ a@@ tedly mo@@ ved to blo@@ ck or delay regulations opposed by the chem@@ ical and fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fu@@ el indus@@ tries .
W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day &apos;s su@@ d@@ den re@@ vers@@ al is the latest legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s regulatory ro@@ ll@@ back agenda .
last month , a feder@@ al appe@@ als court in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton r@@ ul@@ ed the E@@ P@@ A administra@@ tor over@@ ste@@ pped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an O@@ b@@ am@@ a administration rule requ@@ ir@@ ing oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce me@@ than@@ e lea@@ ks .
in a statement issu@@ ed W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day evening , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t suggested his ab@@ out@@ -@@ face on o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ced the E@@ P@@ A &apos;s commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time .
&quot; under previous administra@@ tions , E@@ P@@ A would often fail to meet desig@@ nation dead@@ lines , and then wait to be su@@ ed by acti@@ vis@@ t groups and others , agre@@ eing in a sett@@ l@@ ement to set sch@@ ed@@ ules for desig@@ nation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who su@@ ed E@@ P@@ A more than a do@@ z@@ en times in his pri@@ or job .
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through l@@ iti@@ g@@ ation , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the sta@@ tute and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot;
still , the E@@ P@@ A &apos;s statement said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t may at some point once again use his &quot; delay authority and all other authority legally available &quot; to ensure regulations &quot; are foun@@ ded on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans in C@@ ong@@ ress are pus@@ hing for a broad@@ er re@@ wr@@ ite of the o@@ zone rules .
a House b@@ ill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 20@@ 15 rules at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the S@@ en@@ ate .
new Yor@@ k A@@ t@@ tor@@ ne@@ y General E@@ ri@@ c Sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man , who led the co@@ al@@ ition of states that su@@ ed the E@@ P@@ A this week , said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure .
&quot; the E@@ P@@ A &apos;s re@@ vers@@ al - following our law@@ su@@ its - is an important w@@ in for the health and safety of those 6@@ .@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the over 1@@ 15 million Americ@@ ans directly imp@@ ac@@ ted by smo@@ g p@@ our@@ ing into their communities , &quot; Sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man said .

in the light of this information , all inf@@ ec@@ tions in eas@@ tern S@@ av@@ onia are related to the first me@@ as@@ les inf@@ ec@@ tion dis@@ covered in the area in June .
&quot; this is good ne@@ ws , as this means that there are no sig@@ ns of any other vir@@ us types .
however , it &apos;s possible that new inf@@ ec@@ tions will be dis@@ covered after this fif@@ th case until the m@@ iddle of A@@ ug@@ ust , and the danger is@@ n &apos;@@ t over yet , &quot; says M@@ ir@@ k@@ al@@ e@@ ena E@@ r@@ k@@ k@@ il@@ ä , p@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ an in charge of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases in basic heal@@ th@@ care services at S@@ os@@ ter@@ i .

Fin@@ land is getting ready to make legal kil@@ j@@ u
making mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal has not even been considered ,
as the process results not only in al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , but also me@@ than@@ ol which is to@@ x@@ ic .
preparing kil@@ j@@ u , a traditional hom@@ em@@ ade F@@ inn@@ ish al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic b@@ ever@@ age , will be legal next year , while making mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal will not even be considered .
K@@ il@@ j@@ u is prepared through fer@@ men@@ tation , while mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine is made by means of dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation .
the regulation on dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation is based on the fact that the process results not only in al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , but also me@@ than@@ ol which is to@@ x@@ ic .
&quot; we ha@@ ven &apos;@@ t seen any political party that is ready to make mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal for everyone , &quot; says Is@@ m@@ o Tu@@ om@@ inen , S@@ eni@@ or Minis@@ teri@@ al advis@@ er from the Minis@@ try of Social Affairs and Health .
when the minis@@ try origin@@ ally prepared the reform of the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Ac@@ t , making the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine legal was not even considered .
furthermore , it was not raised in political debate .
&quot; we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t talk about making dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation legal , &quot; says Member of Parliament O@@ u@@ ti M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä ( N@@ ational Co@@ al@@ ition Party ) .
she is in the negoti@@ ation te@@ am of parliamentary groups of parties represented in the Government that discussed the reform of the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Ac@@ t .
no per@@ mission can be ob@@ tained for the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of mo@@ on@@ sh@@ ine at home , not even with an application .
in addition , its commercial production will remain subject to a lic@@ ence .
Tu@@ om@@ inen says that there will be a simple rule to regula@@ te the production of al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic b@@ ever@@ ages at home : al@@ co@@ ho@@ l can be made at home if it is fer@@ men@@ ted .
this means that , in addition to be@@ er , c@@ id@@ er and w@@ ine , it will be legal to make kil@@ j@@ u at home .
the Government wanted to make the regulations govern@@ ing al@@ co@@ ho@@ l simp@@ ler .
&quot; the new act remo@@ ves any requirements related to fla@@ v@@ our@@ ing substances and per@@ m@@ its the prepar@@ ation of kil@@ j@@ u , &quot; M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä speci@@ f@@ ies .
in the prepar@@ ation process , ing@@ redi@@ ents and any fla@@ v@@ our@@ ing substances produced as a result of the fer@@ men@@ tation process must be clearly identi@@ fi@@ able in the b@@ ever@@ age .
according to the new act , people can prepare as high v@@ olu@@ mes of these b@@ ever@@ ages as they want , and hom@@ em@@ ade al@@ co@@ ho@@ l can also be given as a gi@@ ft .
however , it cannot be sol@@ d .
&quot; making kil@@ j@@ u is no longer a problem related to national health in Fin@@ land , &quot; Tu@@ om@@ inen says .
a much larg@@ er change took place in 2004 when any restrictions on impor@@ ting al@@ co@@ ho@@ l from Es@@ ton@@ ia and other EU states were remo@@ ved .
as much as 75 per cent of all al@@ co@@ ho@@ l consum@@ ed in Fin@@ land is impor@@ ted from Es@@ ton@@ ia .
the al@@ co@@ ho@@ l b@@ ill is currently being examin@@ ed by the Minis@@ try of Justice .
the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Ac@@ t will be discussed in Parliament when the autu@@ m@@ n term star@@ ts .
the plenary session will be on 5 September .
the new act will enter into force from the beginning of 20@@ 18 .
&quot; the act has been prepared thorou@@ gh@@ ly .
it &apos;s like Parliament had taken a stand , &quot; M@@ ä@@ kel@@ ä says .

Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord mas@@ sa@@ cr@@ e : acti@@ vis@@ ts Re@@ en@@ act R@@ ac@@ ist l@@ yn@@ ching as a C@@ all for Justice
a 19@@ 48 F@@ ord M@@ er@@ cur@@ y passed through a group of on@@ lo@@ ok@@ ers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Geor@@ gia , and r@@ um@@ b@@ led to@@ ward the small Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord Br@@ id@@ ge .
before the c@@ ar , which had four b@@ lack passeng@@ ers and a wh@@ ite dri@@ ver , could reach the br@@ id@@ ge , a group of wh@@ ite men with g@@ un@@ s ste@@ pped forward to blo@@ ck its p@@ ath .
the lead@@ er of the mo@@ b - a m@@ iddle aged man in a p@@ ins@@ tri@@ p@@ ed su@@ it - took a long dra@@ g on his ci@@ g@@ ar and pe@@ ered through the w@@ ind@@ shi@@ el@@ d .
in@@ side , the occu@@ pan@@ ts re@@ el@@ ed in fear .
&quot; we want that n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ r R@@ og@@ er ! &quot; the man bar@@ ked .
&quot; get him out of the c@@ ar ! &quot;
s@@ cre@@ am@@ s ri@@ pped through the sil@@ ence as a young b@@ lack man was dra@@ g@@ ged from the fron@@ t passeng@@ er se@@ at .
for@@ tunately , this hor@@ ri@@ fic sc@@ ene , which played out on July 22 , is just a re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
but when a no@@ ose is th@@ ro@@ wn around the nec@@ k of &quot; R@@ og@@ er , &quot; ne@@ arly everyone in the au@@ di@@ ence let out very real g@@ as@@ ps .
since 2005 , civil rights acti@@ vis@@ ts have re@@ turned to the Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord Br@@ id@@ ge to rec@@ re@@ ate the night two b@@ lack cou@@ ples - R@@ og@@ er and D@@ o@@ ro@@ thy Mal@@ co@@ m , and Geor@@ ge and Ma@@ e M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y D@@ or@@ se@@ y - were l@@ yn@@ ched by the K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
no one has ever been char@@ ged with the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it &apos;s mind b@@ og@@ g@@ ling that all of these years , not a single person has been ar@@ res@@ ted - even though we see them in our communities ; even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one bro@@ o@@ ks , who help@@ s organ@@ iz@@ e the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
&quot; it &apos;s a sta@@ in on a history , but it &apos;s a burden on our sou@@ ls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 7@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old former Geor@@ gia state con@@ g@@ res@@ sman and lif@@ el@@ ong civil rights acti@@ vis@@ t .
for him , the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment ser@@ ves as a dra@@ matic call to action and an annual remin@@ der to the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an in@@ justice has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want prosecu@@ tion , we want clos@@ ure , we want heal@@ ing , we want re@@ conciliation , but we have to have justice first , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;@@ t get to heal@@ ing and re@@ conciliation until we get justice . &quot;
a cor@@ on@@ er places a sh@@ eet over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord l@@ yn@@ ching on July 27 , 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
according to F@@ B@@ I fil@@ es ob@@ tained by N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing coun@@ ties were sus@@ pec@@ ted in the l@@ yn@@ ching .
but not one was ever prosecu@@ ted .
though the sus@@ pects have remain@@ ed at large for dec@@ ad@@ es , civil rights acti@@ vis@@ ts say the tw@@ in mo@@ ti@@ vations for the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings were always well known throughout to@@ wn : politics and se@@ x .
in April 19@@ 4@@ 6 , a Su@@ pre@@ me Court r@@ ul@@ ing enab@@ led b@@ lack citizens in Geor@@ gia to c@@ ast b@@ all@@ o@@ ts for the first time during the primary ra@@ ce later that sum@@ mer .
around the same time of the election , according to the F@@ B@@ I , b@@ lack shar@@ ec@@ ro@@ p@@ per R@@ og@@ er Mal@@ co@@ m sta@@ b@@ bed Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ es@@ ter , a wh@@ ite lan@@ do@@ w@@ ner , during a fight - os@@ ten@@ sibly over a w@@ oman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said the to@@ wn r@@ um@@ or was that H@@ es@@ ter had been s@@ le@@ eping with Mal@@ co@@ m &apos;s wi@@ f@@ e , D@@ o@@ ro@@ thy , and that the ba@@ by she was car@@ rying was not her h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s .
on July 25 , 19@@ 4@@ 6 , L@@ o@@ y Har@@ ris@@ on , a pro@@ min@@ ent wh@@ ite lan@@ do@@ w@@ ner , paid $ 6@@ 00 to b@@ ai@@ l Mal@@ co@@ m out of ja@@ il , according to the F@@ B@@ I .
he was ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed to the pris@@ on by D@@ o@@ ro@@ thy , and their cou@@ sin@@ s , Ma@@ e M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y and Geor@@ ge D@@ or@@ se@@ y .
but , dri@@ ving away from the ja@@ il , as they appro@@ ac@@ hed Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord Br@@ id@@ ge , a l@@ yn@@ ch mo@@ b sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed the c@@ ar .
&quot; as it tur@@ ns out it was Har@@ ris@@ on who set up and ord@@ ered the mur@@ ders , &quot; one F@@ B@@ I report conclu@@ des .
&quot; it is also appar@@ ent that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy among state and local law en@@ for@@ cement , who not only took part in the mur@@ ders , dis@@ posed of evidence and conc@@ e@@ al@@ ed the id@@ entity of wit@@ n@@ esses . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks put it more succ@@ inc@@ tly .
&quot; it was a voting rights mas@@ sa@@ cr@@ e , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all kill@@ ed to send a message to b@@ lack people in this community : &apos; if you regis@@ ter and if you vote , this is what will happen to you . &apos; &quot;
for ne@@ arly a dec@@ ade , Cas@@ san@@ d@@ ra Gre@@ ene has direc@@ ted the annual re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment of the Mo@@ or@@ e &apos;s F@@ ord Br@@ id@@ ge l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings .
her per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c , g@@ ri@@ pp@@ ing and gro@@ und@@ ed in a kind of de@@ ep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s difficult to w@@ at@@ ch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; we d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to talk about the l@@ yn@@ ching because it makes us face the ug@@ lin@@ ess in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;@@ t build a relationship with you , if you w@@ on &apos;@@ t hear me , or hear what I &apos;@@ ve been through . &quot;
Re@@ hear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production beg@@ an in June , and on the first day ne@@ arly 30 ac@@ tors - a do@@ z@@ en wh@@ ite and the rest b@@ lack - cro@@ w@@ ded into a room and lis@@ tened as Gre@@ ene laun@@ ched into a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ hear@@ sed over@@ view of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh ser@@ ves as Gre@@ ene &apos;s co@@ -@@ direc@@ tor .
he &apos;s played the part of the head K@@ l@@ ans@@ man for years , but he said the role never gets any easier .
&quot; I feel di@@ r@@ ty because this is not who I am , &quot; said Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this history ali@@ ve because we d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to go back to those times . &quot;
across the room , ac@@ tors D@@ arri@@ us B@@ rad@@ sha@@ w and N@@ ic@@ k R@@ as@@ con@@ a , who play R@@ og@@ er Mal@@ co@@ m and Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ es@@ ter , re@@ hear@@ sed their lines .
the play beg@@ ins with Mal@@ co@@ m sh@@ ou@@ ting and sho@@ ving H@@ es@@ ter , li@@ vi@@ d that he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ eping with his wi@@ f@@ e , D@@ o@@ ro@@ thy .
&quot; I said n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ a , get off my proper@@ ty ! &quot;
R@@ as@@ con@@ a fi@@ res back .
there &apos;s a be@@ at .
and then everyone ( at least all the b@@ lack ac@@ tors ) bur@@ s@@ ts into lau@@ gh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh@@ s the har@@ des@@ t .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; R@@ as@@ con@@ a asked .
he &apos;s al@@ arm@@ ed , conf@@ used .
did I go too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said through c@@ hu@@ c@@ kl@@ es .
&quot; I just d@@ on &apos;@@ t think wh@@ ite people back then said &apos; n@@ -@@ -@@ -@@ a . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ e@@ a , &quot; one of the other b@@ lack c@@ ast members qu@@ ip@@ p@@ ed .
&quot; you have to h@@ it the hard &apos; R@@ . &apos; &quot;
and just like that the energy in the room shi@@ f@@ ts ; a sense of ca@@ mar@@ ad@@ er@@ i@@ e re@@ places the dis@@ com@@ for@@ t .
everyone is d@@ ed@@ icated to getting this right , not only for the sa@@ ke of the play , but also for the m@@ em@@ ory of the four people kill@@ ed .
the sc@@ ene beg@@ ins again .
this time , when R@@ as@@ con@@ a says the N@@ -@@ word , it &apos;s shar@@ p and empha@@ tic .
absolutely no one lau@@ gh@@ s .
the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there &apos;s s@@ cre@@ am@@ s , g@@ un@@ fir@@ e and then , sil@@ ence .
a w@@ oman d@@ res@@ sed in f@@ un@@ er@@ al b@@ lack , stands over the ac@@ tors bodies and per@@ forms B@@ ill@@ i@@ e H@@ ol@@ id@@ ay &apos;s m@@ our@@ n@@ ful e@@ ul@@ og@@ y , &quot; str@@ an@@ ge F@@ ru@@ it . &quot;
her voice brea@@ ks on every other word .
a hund@@ red y@@ ards back , a group of about four do@@ z@@ en spec@@ ta@@ tors wi@@ pe s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars away from their e@@ yes .
the au@@ di@@ ence is almost even@@ ly sp@@ li@@ t between b@@ lack and wh@@ ite .
one cou@@ ple has tra@@ vel@@ ed from I@@ th@@ ac@@ a , New Yor@@ k , to see the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce , many are from just down the road .
they &apos;@@ ve all wea@@ ther@@ ed Geor@@ gia &apos;s op@@ pres@@ sive hu@@ mid@@ ity for the ne@@ arly eight hours as bro@@ o@@ ks lead them on a pil@@ gr@@ im@@ age to the gra@@ ve si@@ tes of the Mal@@ com@@ s and D@@ or@@ se@@ ys .
up until this point , the mur@@ ders have remain@@ ed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ e , but now , standing on the same land where the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings took place , the air fe@@ els ha@@ un@@ ted .
as the final no@@ tes of the s@@ ong f@@ ade , Gre@@ ene invi@@ tes the cro@@ w@@ d to move closer and ins@@ pect the bodies .
children cro@@ uc@@ h by their head@@ s , take in the fa@@ ke blood and still bodies , and wh@@ is@@ per to each other .
&quot; they &apos;@@ re not really de@@ ad , &quot; one little bo@@ y mu@@ t@@ ters , as if to remind him@@ self .
after a few minu@@ tes Gre@@ ene thanks the cro@@ w@@ d , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly it &apos;s over .
the ac@@ tors th@@ row off the l@@ yn@@ ching ro@@ pe and wi@@ pe away te@@ ars .
B@@ rad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh , the man in the su@@ it who played the head K@@ l@@ ans@@ man .
N@@ ic@@ k R@@ as@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his cas@@ t@@ ma@@ tes , and then brea@@ ks down cr@@ ying in their arms ; the em@@ o@@ tional tol@@ l of the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce finally getting to him .
&quot; it &apos;s o@@ ka@@ y , &quot; one of the women wh@@ is@@ per@@ s .
&quot; we know that &apos;s not what &apos;s in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later , the au@@ di@@ ence sit@@ s down to d@@ inn@@ er with the ac@@ tors .
at one table , a wh@@ ite cou@@ ple from A@@ tlan@@ ta cha@@ ts an@@ im@@ a@@ tedly about the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment with a b@@ lack cou@@ ple they just met .
D@@ en@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ ins@@ ki str@@ u@@ gg@@ led to find words for how the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce made her feel .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear those hor@@ ri@@ ble aw@@ ful words , and de@@ ed@@ s ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; what this really does to me is make me think that l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings are still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; they &apos;@@ re just called police sho@@ ot@@ ings now . &quot;
across the room , T@@ yr@@ one bro@@ o@@ ks hol@@ ds court at his table , e@@ ating and R@@ em@@ inis@@ cing about civil rights .
he said he &apos;s already be@@ gu@@ n planning for next year &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
&quot; the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment is ins@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional in a way because it descri@@ b@@ es the hor@@ ro@@ r of what we endu@@ red , but it also is a te@@ ac@@ hing moment , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like , if you d@@ on &apos;@@ t learn from this , it can happen again .
those who d@@ on &apos;@@ t study their history , those who do not know their history , are do@@ om@@ ed to repeat it . &quot;
te@@ aring ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les in sh@@ op@@ s he@@ ats up feel@@ ings : this is how much you can actually sa@@ ve by remo@@ ving &quot; ex@@ tra parts &quot;
can cau@@ lif@@ lower lea@@ ves be remo@@ ved before w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ing ?
what about the large top of a p@@ ine@@ app@@ le ? after all , it w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s who knows how much .
people are divid@@ ed : for some , this is an ind@@ ication of extre@@ me st@@ ing@@ in@@ ess , some do not want to pay for the parts that they will not use and that they would th@@ row away any@@ way .
this is an ever@@ yd@@ ay phen@@ omen@@ on in sh@@ op@@ s .
for example , emp@@ ty car@@ d@@ board bo@@ x@@ es have been placed in the ve@@ ge@@ table sec@@ tion of K@@ -@@ C@@ it@@ y@@ market Ru@@ oh@@ ol@@ ah@@ ti in Hel@@ sin@@ ki because many , for example , re@@ move cau@@ lif@@ lower lea@@ ves .
when placed in these bo@@ x@@ es , the lea@@ ves are then dis@@ posed of as bio@@ waste .
according to ne@@ ws published by T@@ al@@ ous@@ san@@ om@@ at , sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s are a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed by this behaviour .
how much can you really sa@@ ve by remo@@ ving un@@ necessary parts before w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ing ?
how effective is this really ?
me N@@ ais@@ et ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine tes@@ ted what the price of a p@@ ine@@ app@@ le , ar@@ tic@@ ho@@ ke , mus@@ h@@ room , bro@@ cc@@ oli and cau@@ lif@@ lower is after any un@@ necessary parts are remo@@ ved .
C@@ au@@ lif@@ lower : the price of a cau@@ lif@@ lower origin@@ ally EUR 2@@ .@@ 10 was EUR 1.@@ 80 after all the lea@@ ves were remo@@ ved .
p@@ ine@@ app@@ le : the price of a full p@@ ine@@ app@@ le of EUR 2@@ .30 fel@@ l to EUR 1.@@ 95 after the top was remo@@ ved .
Ar@@ tic@@ ho@@ ke : the price dro@@ pped from EUR 2@@ .@@ 60 to EUR 2@@ .@@ 40 after the base was cut off .
mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms : the total price of two mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms was EUR 0.@@ 75 .
without the base , their price was EUR 0.@@ 60 .
bro@@ cc@@ oli : a medi@@ um@@ -@@ sized bro@@ cc@@ oli cost EUR 1 , and the price dec@@ reas@@ ed to EUR 0.@@ 80 after the base was remo@@ ved .
results : if any un@@ necessary parts are remo@@ ved , you can sa@@ ve a few do@@ z@@ en c@@ ents when bu@@ ying a single ve@@ ge@@ table .
in perc@@ enta@@ ge terms , the price dec@@ reas@@ ed by as much as 20 per cent .
therefore , you could have sa@@ ved EUR 1.@@ 20 from the a@@ fore@@ mentioned pur@@ ch@@ ases !
Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r b@@ ought out of Barcelona - the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian sta@@ r signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal with P@@ S@@ G
A@@ F@@ P reports that B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian sta@@ r pla@@ yer Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r has signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal with French foot@@ b@@ all c@@ lu@@ b Par@@ is S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main ( P@@ S@@ G ) .
earlier in Th@@ urs@@ day evening it was re@@ ported that Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s representatives had paid the rele@@ ase fe@@ e of EUR 2@@ 22 million to F@@ C Barcelona playing in the Spanish P@@ r@@ im@@ er@@ a D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón .
the inc@@ redi@@ ble transfer fe@@ e of EUR 2@@ 22 million is the highest fe@@ e ever paid in the history of foot@@ b@@ all .
the earlier record was held by Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United which paid EUR 10@@ 5 million for French P@@ au@@ l P@@ og@@ b@@ a last sum@@ mer .
the P@@ r@@ im@@ er@@ a D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón fro@@ z@@ e the transfer earlier on Th@@ urs@@ day when it rejected the first payment attemp@@ ted by Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s representatives .
according to the rules of the P@@ r@@ im@@ er@@ a D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón , a bu@@ ying c@@ lu@@ b cannot pay a fe@@ e mat@@ ching the rele@@ ase clause directly to the sell@@ er , but the pla@@ yer must pay him@@ self out of his deal . this takes place by pass@@ ing the fe@@ e through the P@@ r@@ im@@ er@@ a D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón .
in practice , P@@ S@@ G paid the su@@ m to Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r and his representatives who , through the P@@ r@@ im@@ er@@ a D@@ iv@@ isi@@ ón , for@@ war@@ ded the funds to Barcelona .
Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r is expected to arri@@ ve in Par@@ is on F@@ rid@@ ay .
he will possibly be presented to his new home cro@@ w@@ d at P@@ S@@ G &apos;s se@@ as@@ on open@@ er against A@@ mi@@ ens on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A to investig@@ ate the details
in a press rele@@ ase , Barcelona announced that it will send information about the fe@@ e to the Union of European F@@ o@@ ot@@ b@@ all As@@ soci@@ ations ( U@@ E@@ F@@ A ) so that it can define any dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary actions resul@@ ting from the transfer .
for example , J@@ avi@@ er T@@ eb@@ as , presid@@ ent of L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a de F@@ ú@@ t@@ bo@@ l Pro@@ f@@ esi@@ onal , the Spanish association of professional foot@@ b@@ all , has sus@@ pec@@ ted that P@@ S@@ G is in b@@ reach of the rules of U@@ E@@ F@@ A &apos;s financial fair play through its spending .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A has the right to impose sanctions on a c@@ lu@@ b that produc@@ es los@@ ses of more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years .
according to U@@ E@@ F@@ A , Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s transfer does not autom@@ a@@ tically viol@@ ate these rules .
Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s transfer to P@@ S@@ G will have an impact on the c@@ lu@@ b &apos;s finan@@ ces for several years , but this impact cannot be evalu@@ ated be@@ fore@@ hand .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A stated that P@@ S@@ G may , for example , sel@@ l pla@@ yers at significant fe@@ es .
P@@ S@@ G is ow@@ ned by Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r S@@ ports In@@ ves@@ tment , a sta@@ te@@ -@@ ow@@ ned company from Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r .

on Mon@@ day a su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ ber kill@@ ed two people ne@@ ar the Iraqi emb@@ ass@@ y in K@@ ab@@ u@@ l .

the statement said that all those in@@ ju@@ red are in a sta@@ ble condition and are being treated at the US military h@@ os@@ p@@ ital at B@@ ag@@ ra@@ m air@@ field .
cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ents say the growing streng@@ th of the T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as so@@ -@@ called Isla@@ mic State ( is ) in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h is a major source of concern to Na@@ to forces based in ne@@ ar@@ by B@@ ag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , Afghanistan saw at least 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 6@@ 2 civil@@ ian de@@ a@@ ths in the first half of 20@@ 17 , with about 20 % of those in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ ic@@ ide c@@ ar bom@@ b kill@@ ed at least 30 people in a mainly S@@ h@@ ia dis@@ tric@@ t of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they had carried out that attack .
on 31 May , a huge bom@@ b@@ ing in the centre of the c@@ ity kill@@ ed more than 1@@ 50 people , the dead@@ li@@ est mili@@ tant attack in the country since US@@ -@@ led forces ous@@ ted the T@@ ali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ar@@ ious security situation in Afghanistan as US President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s up whether to increase the number of US tro@@ op@@ s aid@@ ing the military and police in the country .
cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ents say the su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ b@@ ings in K@@ ab@@ u@@ l in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the re@@ pu@@ tation of President A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f G@@ han@@ i .

the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Environ@@ mental Pro@@ te@@ c@@ tion Agency re@@ ver@@ sed a decision to delay an O@@ ba@@ ma@@ -@@ er@@ a rule requ@@ ir@@ ing states to cur@@ b smo@@ g@@ -@@ ca@@ using emissions , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency over the move .
the E@@ P@@ A announced the decision to go ahead with the so@@ -@@ called &quot; 20@@ 15 O@@ zone D@@ es@@ ig@@ nations &quot; late on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , saying it show@@ ed the agency &apos;s commitment to working with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with , and being respon@@ sive to , our state partners , &quot; E@@ P@@ A C@@ hi@@ ef Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t said in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in June had announced the E@@ P@@ A &apos;s intention to delay the o@@ zone desig@@ nations - in which existing smo@@ g pollution is measu@@ red in parts of the country to determin@@ e where cu@@ ts must be made to meet tou@@ gh@@ er air quality standard - by one year to October 20@@ 18 .
a group of 15 m@@ os@@ tly Democ@@ ratic states , along with the D@@ is@@ tric@@ t of C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia , f@@ iled a su@@ it on Tu@@ es@@ day saying the effort was illegal .
the administration of President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p has been seeking to ro@@ l@@ l back a wide ar@@ ra@@ y of environmental regulations imposed by former President Bar@@ ac@@ k O@@ b@@ am@@ a , as part of a broad@@ er agenda tr@@ um@@ p says is aimed at s@@ par@@ king economic growth .
but the efforts have tri@@ gg@@ ered pus@@ h@@ back by Democ@@ ra@@ tics and con@@ ser@@ vation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the E@@ P@@ A &apos;s we@@ b@@ sit@@ e says brea@@ thing air contain@@ ing o@@ zone &quot; can reduce l@@ un@@ g function and increase res@@ pi@@ ra@@ tory sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s &quot; like as@@ th@@ ma .
S@@ yd@@ ne@@ y Mor@@ ning Her@@ al@@ d reports that one of the leaders of I@@ S@@ I@@ S had also sent parts of a bom@@ b to S@@ yd@@ ne@@ y .
according to the sus@@ pects , their intention was to pl@@ ant the bom@@ b on a plan@@ e on 15 July , but their attempt failed before the security chec@@ k@@ point .
the police have not dis@@ closed any details of why the attempt failed .
another plan of the sus@@ pec@@ ted terroris@@ ts was to build a ma@@ ch@@ ine that s@@ pre@@ ads a col@@ our@@ less to@@ x@@ ic gas and carry it to a public place full of people , such as a public transport vehic@@ le .
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ hel@@ an , a de@@ pu@@ ty com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er of the Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ian F@@ eder@@ al Pol@@ ice , says that this was one of the most professional plans ever wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia .
due to the plans of sus@@ pec@@ ted terroris@@ ts , four men were ap@@ prehen@@ ded in police ra@@ id@@ s on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
one of the men has been rele@@ ased , but his inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations will also be continued later .

average mon@@ th@@ ly sal@@ ary EUR 5@@ ,@@ 300 , regar@@ d@@ less of education - the &quot; W@@ il@@ d W@@ est &quot; of investment advis@@ ors
the quality of investment advice has raised much debate .
most recently , Hel@@ sing@@ in S@@ anom@@ at w@@ ro@@ te about R@@ it@@ va , 6@@ 8 , to whom an investment advis@@ or of a ban@@ king firm tal@@ ked complete n@@ on@@ sense when sell@@ ing investment products .
regulations govern@@ ing investment advis@@ ors and the s@@ ale of various investment products will become stric@@ ter at the beginning of next year .
these are based on the new Mar@@ ket@@ s in Finan@@ cial In@@ str@@ u@@ ments Directive which will be applied starting from the beginning of next year .
currently , the evaluation of the competence of investment advis@@ ors and employees who sel@@ l investment products is mainly based on sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation .
no competence requirements are defined in the legislation .
finance Fin@@ land ( F@@ F@@ I ) recom@@ men@@ ds that individuals working in investment services complete its A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 or A@@ V@@ P@@ 2 quali@@ fications .
F@@ F@@ I has as@@ signed the provision of its quali@@ fications to A@@ P@@ V In@@ ves@@ tment examin@@ ations L@@ t@@ d , whose quali@@ fications te@@ am consis@@ ts of experts from the Finan@@ cial Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Authority , univers@@ ities and companies operating in the field .
the quali@@ fications require 12@@ -@@ 15 cre@@ d@@ its and their examin@@ ations are prepared by A@@ al@@ to Uni@@ versity Ex@@ ecu@@ tive E@@ duc@@ ation which off@@ ers development services for business management .
its we@@ b@@ sit@@ e says that both of its examin@@ ations have &quot; fair@@ ly exten@@ sive requirements . &quot;
the study material consis@@ ts of 10@@ -@@ 15 bo@@ o@@ ks and a number of other guid@@ es and jour@@ n@@ als .
Mar@@ k@@ k@@ u S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , manag@@ ing direc@@ tor of A@@ P@@ V In@@ ves@@ tment examin@@ ations L@@ t@@ d , says that rou@@ gh@@ ly 70 per cent of those who take the examin@@ ations pass .
&quot; when it comes to the larg@@ est ban@@ ks , ne@@ arly all of their employees who sel@@ l investment services have comple@@ ted either A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 or A@@ P@@ V@@ 2 quali@@ fications , as this is a man@@ d@@ atory requirement set out in their own rules .
then again , there are small@@ er ban@@ king fir@@ ms - I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to name any na@@ mes - whose employees seem to ste@@ er clear of these quali@@ fications , &quot; S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says .
according to S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , there are &quot; a few &quot; ban@@ king fir@@ ms like this .
S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says that , since 2000 , 13@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ 14@@ ,@@ 000 people have comple@@ ted A@@ P@@ V@@ 1 quali@@ fications , while rou@@ gh@@ ly 3@@ ,@@ 000 people have comple@@ ted the more deman@@ ding A@@ P@@ V@@ 2 quali@@ fications recommend@@ ed for investment advis@@ ors .
some ban@@ king fir@@ ms consider the quali@@ fications to offer an advantage .
many other business fields are regula@@ ted by much stric@@ ter competence requirements .
S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says that the F@@ F@@ I recommendation requires that A@@ P@@ V quali@@ fications are comple@@ ted , as they secure inves@@ t@@ men@@ t@@ -@@ related competence .
according to Sta@@ tis@@ tics Fin@@ land , the average mon@@ th@@ ly ear@@ n@@ ings of financial and investment advis@@ ors are several thousands of euro@@ s , including fe@@ es , f@@ rin@@ ge benefits and prof@@ it@@ -@@ based b@@ on@@ uses .
the average mon@@ th@@ ly sal@@ ary of regula@@ r employees is rou@@ gh@@ ly EUR 5@@ ,@@ 300 .
the average mon@@ th@@ ly sal@@ ary of men in this line of work is more than EUR 5@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 and that of women is more than EUR 4@@ ,@@ 500 .
the top ten per cent receiv@@ ing the highest sal@@ ary ear@@ ns rou@@ gh@@ ly EUR 8@@ ,@@ 100 ,
with men ear@@ ning more than EUR 9@@ ,@@ 000 a month and women receiv@@ ing EUR 6@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 or more .
investment advice in accordance with the Ac@@ t on In@@ ves@@ tment Ser@@ vic@@ es can only be offer@@ ed by a lic@@ ens@@ ed company .
so far , employees and positions have been govern@@ ed by means of sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation .
an inspec@@ tion by the Finan@@ cial Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Authority re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed individual cases where the professional s@@ kill@@ s and competence of investment advis@@ ors were not at a sufficient level on the basis of their actions .
&quot; in principle , an employe@@ e can sel@@ l investment products , even if their professional s@@ kill@@ s or competence levels are low .
basically , the situation has been un@@ regula@@ ted .
many other business fields are regula@@ ted by much stric@@ ter competence requirements , &quot; S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko says .
according to S@@ av@@ ik@@ ko , regulations will become stric@@ ter from the beginning of next year as a result of the new Mar@@ ket@@ s in Finan@@ cial In@@ str@@ u@@ ments Directive ( Mi@@ F@@ I@@ D II ) .
it demands every company to ensure that their employees who offer investment services have sufficient s@@ kill@@ s .
the Finan@@ cial Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Authority will be author@@ ised to decide what types of s@@ kill@@ s employees need .
Mar@@ ko H@@ ov@@ i , sen@@ i@@ or market super@@ vis@@ or at the Finan@@ cial Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Authority , says that one of the most significant changes is the requirement for the competence and experience of investment advis@@ ors and employees who sel@@ l investment products .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , the new requirements apply to the staff of investment service companies and their part@@ ner ag@@ ents who sel@@ l products on their behalf .
H@@ ov@@ i says that , according to the Government proposal issu@@ ed by the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance , the Finan@@ cial Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Authority will be author@@ ised to decide on the competence and experience required .
what the ex@@ act levels are will be decided later in the autu@@ m@@ n .
in the future , companies must see to necessary training and , if required , monitoring and continuing training .
all of this needs to be docu@@ men@@ ted , and companies will be oblig@@ ated to prove that this has been done .
H@@ ov@@ i speci@@ f@@ ies that , in practice , companies need to define the job descri@@ p@@ tions of every employe@@ e .
it is expected that there will be different requirement levels , depen@@ ding on whether an employe@@ e is an investment advis@@ or or a sell@@ er of investment products .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , another addition is the requirement to work for a specific period with a more experienc@@ ed employe@@ e , if a person &apos;s competence or experience is not at a sufficient level .
this means that , if a company rec@@ ru@@ its a new employe@@ e who does not meet the criteria set , that employe@@ e needs to work with a more experienc@@ ed employe@@ e for a pre@@ -@@ defined time .
according to H@@ ov@@ i , these changes will make the regulations stric@@ ter and more concrete .
the legislation on the s@@ ale of investment products will become stric@@ ter from the beginning of 20@@ 18 .

you would have to see it to believe it .
two days ago , S@@ in@@ itu@@ ot@@ e , a manufac@@ tu@@ re@@ r of cle@@ an@@ ing products , laun@@ ched the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er product range ,
that is , dis@@ h br@@ us@@ hes , to@@ we@@ l rac@@ ks and &quot; a to@@ il@@ et br@@ us@@ h a ri@@ m cle@@ an@@ er . &quot;
here , the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er ref@@ ers to the fil@@ m which pre@@ mi@@ ers in the autu@@ m@@ n and its market@@ ing .
still , there is something pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar about this comb@@ ination , and the products have been tar@@ ge@@ ted in social media : when can we expect the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er san@@ i@@ tary na@@ p@@ kin@@ s ?
there is nothing for it , but to call the company and ask them what this is all about .
what does A@@ ino M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , vice presid@@ ent at S@@ in@@ itu@@ ot@@ e , have to say ?
&quot; we are one of the s@@ pon@@ sor@@ s of the up@@ coming fil@@ m .
we support this fil@@ m , just like many other companies .
our aim was to support F@@ inn@@ ish production and a c@@ ult fil@@ m , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä says .
according to M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , the products will be on special dis@@ play in sh@@ op@@ s , giving visi@@ bility to the fil@@ m .
is@@ n &apos;@@ t there something f@@ un@@ n@@ y about this ? after all , one would think that there is something in common between S@@ in@@ i &apos;s products and the stor@@ ies linked with them .
&quot; there &apos;s a uni@@ fying s@@ tory in that we are a F@@ inn@@ ish company and these are F@@ inn@@ ish products , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä says .
according to M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä , the company follow@@ s the same set of fundamental F@@ inn@@ ish values as those who have seen the original un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er .
&quot; what is more , cle@@ an@@ ing is not that un@@ us@@ ual in the ar@@ my , &quot; M@@ ä@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ ä points out .
other s@@ pon@@ sor@@ s of the un@@ known sol@@ di@@ er include V@@ ali@@ o , Har@@ tw@@ all , S@@ alu@@ do , V@@ R and Sa@@ to .

new results of Sweden &apos;s asylum age assessment tes@@ ts rele@@ ased
the latest results of tes@@ ts on asylum see@@ kers in Sweden sub@@ jec@@ ted to a new method of med@@ ically assess@@ ing their age show that over 80 perc@@ ent tes@@ ted were jud@@ ged to be ol@@ der than 18 , but not everyone has fa@@ it@@ h in their acc@@ ura@@ cy .
Sweden &apos;s national for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency ( R@@ ä@@ t@@ t@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started car@@ rying out the tes@@ ts earlier year .
they are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more acc@@ ura@@ te after the Swedish Mi@@ gration Agency ( Mi@@ gra@@ tion@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was critic@@ iz@@ ed for fail@@ ings in assess@@ ing the correct age of some refugees claim@@ ing to be under@@ age .
to date Mi@@ gra@@ tion@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 6@@ ,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tes@@ ted , and the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency has now rele@@ ased the results of a total of 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 1 tes@@ ts from the period between mid March until July 3@@ 1@@ st , 20@@ 17 .
ei@@ gh@@ ty perc@@ ent ( 2002 ) were jud@@ ged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency jud@@ ged that the subject was &quot; possibly 18 or over . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 . &quot;
the tes@@ ts are only carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an G@@ ö@@ r@@ ans@@ son from the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the num@@ bers are quite consistent , &quot; he told The L@@ oc@@ al .
the high propor@@ tion of cases jud@@ ged to be over 18 does not necess@@ arily mean that the asylum see@@ ker li@@ ed about their age .
in May , the agency rele@@ ased the results of 5@@ 8@@ 1 tes@@ ts and said that there were 4@@ 42 ins@@ tan@@ ces that &quot; suggest the person examin@@ ed is 18 years or ol@@ der . &quot;
when new@@ s@@ paper s@@ ven@@ s@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ d@@ et investig@@ ated the 5@@ 8@@ 1 results rele@@ ased however it found that in 2@@ 43 of the cases the person had open@@ ly stated that they turn 18 this year .
the method of med@@ ical age assessment , which consis@@ ts of taking X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys of wis@@ dom teet@@ h and M@@ R@@ I sc@@ ans of k@@ ne@@ e join@@ ts , then having d@@ ent@@ ists and radi@@ olog@@ ists analys@@ e them , has also been critic@@ ised in some quar@@ ters .
one sc@@ ep@@ tic is Kar@@ ol@@ ins@@ ka In@@ stitu@@ te en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist C@@ la@@ ude Mar@@ c@@ us , whose work includes assess@@ ing the bi@@ ological ma@@ tur@@ ity of people to see if they w@@ ent through pub@@ er@@ ty earlier or later than us@@ ual .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve had reason to think about this , and I d@@ on &apos;@@ t think the type of measu@@ re@@ ment being used should be .
jud@@ ging bi@@ ological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we can &apos;@@ t say it for sure we sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t pre@@ ten@@ d that we can , &quot; he told new@@ s@@ paper met@@ ro .
the for@@ ensi@@ c Med@@ ic@@ ine Agency &apos;s G@@ ö@@ r@@ ans@@ son def@@ en@@ ded the acc@@ ura@@ cy of the tes@@ ts however : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of in@@ acc@@ ura@@ tely jud@@ ging a child to be an ad@@ ult is small .
the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it &apos;s around 10 perc@@ ent . &quot;

&quot; with only 15 govern@@ or@@ ships and control of the fe@@ w@@ est state legisla@@ tures in history , Govern@@ or Justice &apos;s announ@@ cement is just the latest rejec@@ tion of a party that is lead@@ er@@ less from top to b@@ ot@@ tom and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; R@@ N@@ C cha@@ ir@@ w@@ oman R@@ onn@@ a Mc@@ Dan@@ i@@ el said in a statement to C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws .

in P@@ ö@@ y@@ ty@@ ä , li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning struc@@ k the distribution board of a ter@@ rac@@ ed house , ig@@ n@@ iting a small fir@@ e .
the res@@ c@@ ue de@@ part@@ ment ob@@ tained information about the fir@@ e 15 minu@@ tes before mid@@ night on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
the distribution board was loc@@ ated in a sa@@ un@@ a at the end of the ter@@ rac@@ ed house .

el@@ even a@@ part@@ ments were left without electricity , but no@@ -@@ one was in@@ ju@@ red .
in L@@ o@@ im@@ a@@ a , li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning set a sh@@ ed on fir@@ e in Har@@ j@@ ul@@ anti@@ e a little before mid@@ night .
when the res@@ c@@ ue person@@ nel arri@@ ved on sit@@ e , the building was in fla@@ mes and the res@@ c@@ ue person@@ nel were only able to prevent the fir@@ e from s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing .
the sh@@ ed of rou@@ gh@@ ly 50 s@@ qu@@ are met@@ res bur@@ ned to the ground .
in R@@ ä@@ ä@@ k@@ ky@@ l@@ ä ne@@ ar K@@ u@@ op@@ io , li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning struc@@ k a deta@@ ched house .

the res@@ c@@ ue person@@ nel arri@@ ved on sit@@ e to investig@@ ate the situation , but this time the li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning did not cause any fir@@ e - it only bur@@ n@@ t some f@@ uses .
in traffic , th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms caused problems on the rail@@ way line between Se@@ in@@ ä@@ jo@@ ki and V@@ a@@ as@@ a when a s@@ tro@@ ke of li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning dama@@ ged the traffic control system .
information about the fa@@ ult was ob@@ tained on Th@@ urs@@ day morning between 8 and 9 am , after which sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed traffic was re@@ placed by bus@@ es .
the problems was only re@@ pa@@ ired a little before 5 p@@ m ,
after which rail@@ way traffic has continued nor@@ m@@ ally , also in the tra@@ ck sec@@ tion dama@@ ged by li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning .
th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms have w@@ re@@ ak@@ ed ha@@ vo@@ c in different parts of Fin@@ land .

&quot; this sum@@ mer &apos;s th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms have been ut@@ ter@@ ly ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish ! &quot; says me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ log@@ ist J@@ ar@@ i T@@ u@@ o@@ v@@ inen from the F@@ inn@@ ish M@@ e@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ log@@ ical In@@ stitu@@ te .
the inten@@ s@@ ity of the th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day and Th@@ urs@@ day was mainly moder@@ ate but , due to the poor li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning situation this sum@@ mer , many regar@@ ded them as he@@ av@@ y stor@@ ms .
&quot; these could be considered to be he@@ av@@ y th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , and that &apos;s what they were compared with other stor@@ ms this sum@@ mer , &quot; T@@ u@@ o@@ v@@ inen says .
on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , there were 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 f@@ las@@ hes of cl@@ ou@@ d@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ground li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning , and this sum@@ mer &apos;s most inten@@ se th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are expected for Th@@ urs@@ day : by 4 p@@ m , there have already been 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 90 f@@ las@@ hes of li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning .
&quot; if the stor@@ ms extend to the evening , we can have more than 2@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ las@@ hes , &quot; T@@ u@@ o@@ v@@ inen says .
the previous rec@@ ord@@ -@@ low li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning year was in 20@@ 15 when the f@@ las@@ h counter show@@ ed a total of 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ las@@ hes .
by W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , there have been 18@@ ,@@ 3@@ 8@@ 6 f@@ las@@ hes this year .
there is still some cat@@ ching up to do in order not to break the &quot; record &quot; made two years ago .
however , more stor@@ ms can be expected .
according to T@@ u@@ o@@ v@@ inen , the air mass over Fin@@ land will be war@@ m and d@@ ry throughout the week , form@@ ing an ide@@ al environment for th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms .

Co@@ e p@@ ra@@ ises &apos; can@@ did &apos; Russian a@@ pol@@ og@@ y for d@@ op@@ ing s@@ cand@@ al
global a@@ th@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s Se@@ b@@ as@@ ti@@ an Co@@ e p@@ raised what he described as a can@@ did a@@ pol@@ og@@ y from Russia over a d@@ op@@ ing s@@ cand@@ al on Th@@ urs@@ day but reite@@ rated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
Russia &apos;s a@@ th@@ le@@ tics b@@ os@@ s D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin told an I@@ A@@ A@@ F C@@ ong@@ ress , held on the eve of the World A@@ th@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships , that his country &apos;s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ op@@ ing .
he said he was sor@@ ry to &quot; all a@@ th@@ le@@ tes who have had g@@ old and sil@@ ver med@@ als s@@ n@@ at@@ ched from them at compet@@ itions . &quot;
despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ A@@ F C@@ ong@@ ress voted in fa@@ vo@@ r of maintaining the ban , imposed in November 20@@ 15 after a World An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) report found evidence of sta@@ te@@ -@@ s@@ pon@@ so@@ red d@@ op@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very can@@ did response today , a very can@@ did pres@@ entation , &quot; I@@ A@@ A@@ F presid@@ ent Co@@ e told re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole C@@ ong@@ ress was pleased ... that the Russian feder@@ ation rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed themselves that they have been through some pre@@ tty tor@@ ri@@ d times and are doing everything possible to make sure the feder@@ ation is re@@ eng@@ ine@@ ered . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made , but the C@@ ong@@ ress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to re@@ ins@@ ta@@ te Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything over the next few months to nor@@ m@@ ali@@ z@@ e this situation .
the guid@@ ing principle has always been that we wanted to separate the cle@@ an a@@ th@@ le@@ tes from the tain@@ ted system , &quot; he added
n@@ ine@@ teen Russian a@@ th@@ le@@ tes will be compet@@ ing as neu@@ tr@@ als at the World A@@ th@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships which start in L@@ on@@ d@@ on on F@@ rid@@ ay , having met strict I@@ A@@ A@@ F criteria .
the head of the I@@ A@@ A@@ F &apos;s T@@ ask For@@ ce , R@@ un@@ e An@@ der@@ sen , said on Mon@@ day that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for re@@ ins@@ ta@@ te@@ ment .
D@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ tes@@ ting was still in@@ sufficient and bann@@ ed co@@ ac@@ hes were still operating fre@@ ely , he told re@@ por@@ ters in L@@ on@@ d@@ on after a pres@@ entation to the I@@ A@@ A@@ F Council .
production company disap@@ pointed with the poor success of T@@ om of Fin@@ land

&quot; I was af@@ ra@@ id that F@@ inn@@ ish au@@ di@@ ences may be too con@@ serva@@ tive , and it seems that I was right . &quot;
the fil@@ m pre@@ mi@@ ered in February 20@@ 17 .
by the end of June , it had only had a little more than 1@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 vie@@ w@@ ers , a very low figure compared with the fil@@ m &apos;s budget of EUR 5 million .
&quot; this was no j@@ ac@@ k@@ po@@ t , but it &apos;s important that inves@@ tors get their money back ,
which they already would &apos;@@ ve done if the fil@@ m had done any better in Fin@@ land .
now , we need to wait for small re@@ tur@@ ns from ab@@ road , &quot; S@@ uc@@ ks@@ d@@ or@@ ff says .

how so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s financial rules impact Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s move to Par@@ is
rules aimed at preventing un@@ f@@ et@@ te@@ red spending by European so@@ cc@@ er c@@ lu@@ bs will not dis@@ rup@@ t Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ record transfer from Spain &apos;s Barcelona to France &apos;s Par@@ is@@ -@@ S@@ ain@@ t Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come further down the line for Par@@ is S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main from U@@ E@@ F@@ A , the govern@@ ing body over@@ seeing the European ga@@ me which has the power to ban te@@ am@@ s from the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Cha@@ mp@@ ions L@@ eag@@ ue t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
financial F@@ air play rules laun@@ ched by U@@ E@@ F@@ A in 20@@ 11 mean that P@@ S@@ G will even@@ tually have to show that Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s transfer was fund@@ ed without inc@@ ur@@ ring huge los@@ ses .
Barcelona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euro@@ s ( $ 2@@ 6@@ 2 million ) just to bu@@ y the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian out of his contrac@@ t and Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r will comm@@ and a sal@@ ary that will run to ten@@ s of millions of doll@@ ars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s move to France .
P@@ S@@ G can certainly stu@@ m@@ p up the cas@@ h to sign Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r and add him to a g@@ ala@@ x@@ y of other star@@ s , given the te@@ am &apos;s funding from the ener@@ g@@ y@@ -@@ rich r@@ ul@@ ing family of Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r .
c@@ lu@@ bs are allowed to spen@@ d he@@ a@@ vil@@ y on acqu@@ ir@@ ing pla@@ yers but they have to coun@@ ter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach bre@@ ak@@ -@@ even on their foot@@ b@@ all@@ -@@ related business .
F@@ F@@ P was conc@@ eiv@@ ed by M@@ ic@@ he@@ l P@@ la@@ tin@@ i after his election as U@@ E@@ F@@ A presid@@ ent in 200@@ 7 .
the former France pla@@ yer believ@@ ed that c@@ lu@@ bs who ran up huge deb@@ ts in their pursu@@ it of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king ru@@ in if ban@@ ks or ow@@ ners with@@ dre@@ w their support .
in 20@@ 11 , F@@ F@@ P shi@@ f@@ ted from foc@@ using on c@@ lu@@ bs &apos; deb@@ ts to monitoring their los@@ ses instead .
the change me@@ ant that the business model R@@ oman A@@ b@@ ra@@ mo@@ v@@ ich initi@@ ally used at C@@ hel@@ sea in 2003 - bu@@ y a c@@ lu@@ b with potential , and then spen@@ d he@@ a@@ vil@@ y to improve the s@@ qu@@ ad and build a global br@@ and - become a tou@@ gh@@ er propos@@ ition .
during the current thre@@ e@@ -@@ year F@@ F@@ P assessment period that run@@ s through 20@@ 18 , c@@ lu@@ bs can inc@@ ur los@@ ses of 30 million euro@@ s .
and despite P@@ la@@ tin@@ i being ous@@ ted in dis@@ gra@@ ce from the presidency in 20@@ 15 , his U@@ E@@ F@@ A success@@ or A@@ le@@ ks@@ an@@ der C@@ e@@ fer@@ in is still committed to de@@ terr@@ ing excessive spending .
&quot; certainly F@@ F@@ P is not de@@ ad and we will , for sure , reinfor@@ ce the rules going forward , &quot; An@@ dre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ se@@ es F@@ F@@ P at U@@ E@@ F@@ A , told The As@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress last week .
although P@@ S@@ G will have paid Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s bu@@ y@@ out clause in one lu@@ m@@ p su@@ m , it can s@@ pread the amount for accoun@@ ting purposes over the l@@ eng@@ th of his contrac@@ t .
Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r has signed a f@@ iv@@ e@@ -@@ year deal , so the transfer fe@@ e could be shown as a 4@@ 4@@ .@@ 4 mill@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ euro cost in the annual accoun@@ ts for the next five years .
the first wa@@ ve of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 20@@ 14 saw P@@ S@@ G , along with A@@ b@@ u D@@ ha@@ bi@@ -@@ ow@@ ned Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter C@@ ity , h@@ it with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
P@@ S@@ G was han@@ ded a fine of 60 million euro@@ s ( then $ 8@@ 2 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euro@@ s - and ord@@ ered to limit its Cha@@ mp@@ ions L@@ eag@@ ue s@@ qu@@ ads to 21 pla@@ yers for the 20@@ 14@@ -@@ 15 se@@ as@@ on instead of the normal 25 .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A is on the lo@@ ok@@ out for c@@ lu@@ bs who might try to ou@@ tw@@ it its financial regula@@ tors by inf@@ la@@ ting their income through companies linked to a c@@ lu@@ b &apos;s ow@@ ners .
while a Q@@ a@@ tar@@ i company could s@@ pon@@ s@@ or P@@ S@@ G , if the value of the s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship was de@@ em@@ ed to exc@@ eed standard market rates U@@ E@@ F@@ A would not allow it to coun@@ t as legitimate income .
that is what happened in 20@@ 14 when U@@ E@@ F@@ A r@@ ul@@ ed that the value of the Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r Tou@@ rism Authority s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship of P@@ S@@ G was inf@@ lated .
it has been re@@ ported that part of Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s P@@ S@@ G ear@@ n@@ ings could come via payments from the 20@@ 22 World C@@ up organ@@ iz@@ ing committee in Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r .
but P@@ S@@ G and Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r 20@@ 22 have d@@ eni@@ ed that Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r will become a World C@@ up amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or and such a man@@ eu@@ ver would be easy for U@@ E@@ F@@ A &apos;s regula@@ tors to ex@@ pose .
past sanctions s@@ lap@@ p@@ ed on P@@ S@@ G means that U@@ E@@ F@@ A will be even more w@@ at@@ ch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ v@@ ent the rules .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A has not been in pre@@ -@@ emp@@ tive discussions with P@@ S@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s transfer , people fam@@ ili@@ ar with the situation said Th@@ urs@@ day .
they spoke to The As@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress on condition of an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity as they were not author@@ iz@@ ed to discuss the P@@ S@@ G situation .
the last published accoun@@ ts show that P@@ S@@ G made a prof@@ it of more than 10 million euro@@ s in 20@@ 15@@ -@@ 16 on a tur@@ no@@ ver of 5@@ 4@@ 2@@ .@@ 4 million euro@@ s .
accoun@@ ts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
P@@ S@@ G ex@@ pects Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s arri@@ val to be a bo@@ on for s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship de@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and j@@ er@@ se@@ y sal@@ es .
the c@@ lu@@ b ex@@ pects tur@@ no@@ ver would gro@@ w by at least 30 perc@@ ent on the back of the sig@@ ning .
clearly ir@@ ri@@ ta@@ ted to see one of so@@ cc@@ er &apos;s b@@ ig@@ g@@ est pla@@ yers lea@@ ving , the Spanish le@@ ag@@ ue tried to sty@@ mi@@ e Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r &apos;s move , claim@@ ing that P@@ S@@ G will be b@@ reaching F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &apos; financial d@@ op@@ ing &apos; , with the c@@ lu@@ b and the state , &quot; L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a President J@@ avi@@ er T@@ eb@@ as told Spanish new@@ s@@ paper as , referring to Q@@ a@@ ta@@ r &apos;s ultima@@ te ow@@ nership of P@@ S@@ G .
ar@@ sen@@ al manag@@ er Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ eng@@ er , whose c@@ lu@@ b is ow@@ ned by an American s@@ ports ty@@ co@@ on , shar@@ es L@@ a L@@ ig@@ a &apos;s reser@@ vations about a state funding a c@@ lu@@ b .
&quot; it is the consequ@@ ence of the ow@@ ner@@ ships and that has completely changed the whole lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of foot@@ b@@ all in the last 15 years , &quot; W@@ eng@@ er said Th@@ urs@@ day .
&quot; once a country ow@@ ns a c@@ lu@@ b , everything is possible .
it becom@@ es very difficult to respect the Finan@@ cial F@@ air play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big pla@@ yer to represent a country . &quot;

as long as some@@ one makes sure that my chec@@ k mar@@ ks are correct at the sta@@ di@@ um , &quot; Ar@@ t@@ t@@ u P@@ aj@@ ula@@ h@@ ti com@@ men@@ ted on his co@@ ach &apos;s possible sta@@ y at home .
med@@ al for Fin@@ land from World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in L@@ on@@ d@@ on like a mi@@ rac@@ le
the I@@ A@@ A@@ F World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in L@@ on@@ d@@ on will start this F@@ rid@@ ay , en@@ ding after a little more than a week on S@@ und@@ ay 13 A@@ ug@@ ust .
F@@ inn@@ ish au@@ di@@ ences are pas@@ sion@@ ate about a@@ th@@ le@@ tics , c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ country s@@ ki@@ ing and ice ho@@ c@@ key and follow them fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully year after year , through th@@ ic@@ k and th@@ in .
s@@ ports f@@ ans measure success by the number of med@@ als w@@ on .
however , there are other indic@@ ators as well .
less attention is paid to the won@@ der@@ ful stor@@ ies of young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes who gain experience by going from one competition to the next to raise their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce up to a level where they can have a true chance of w@@ inning a med@@ al in open compet@@ itions .
this time , the no@@ t@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ big T@@ e@@ am Fin@@ land does not have such young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , or any ve@@ ter@@ ans for that matter .
w@@ inning a med@@ al would be a mi@@ rac@@ le .
lu@@ c@@ kil@@ y , ne@@ arly anything can happen in s@@ ports .
s@@ ports draw au@@ di@@ ences in fron@@ t of their television s@@ ets to w@@ at@@ ch different events , even though this year &apos;s fin@@ als will be held late at night due to the time difference between L@@ on@@ d@@ on and Fin@@ land .
at the previous I@@ A@@ A@@ F World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in 20@@ 15 , Fin@@ land w@@ on one br@@ on@@ z@@ e med@@ al
by T@@ ero P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki in ja@@ vel@@ in .
the most h@@ ope@@ ful ones are expec@@ ting P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki to bring home another med@@ al , even though the results of P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki and other th@@ ro@@ w@@ ers , as well as his elimin@@ ation from the fin@@ als in European Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships last sum@@ mer , say otherwise .
no matter what happens in this competition , P@@ it@@ k@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ ki will remain in history as one of the great F@@ inn@@ ish s@@ ports her@@ o@@ es .
for other F@@ inn@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , reaching the fin@@ als or making a personal best would be a good result .
the success of our young a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in international compet@@ itions , also this sum@@ mer , gives us hope that F@@ inn@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have a realistic chance of w@@ inning a med@@ al in future compet@@ itions .
growing young tal@@ ents and supporting them finan@@ ci@@ ally is more important that maintaining a small el@@ ite group of top a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
success takes years of hard work from a@@ th@@ le@@ tes and pati@@ ence from co@@ ac@@ hes and f@@ ans .
F@@ inn@@ ish s@@ ports f@@ ans also respect international s@@ ports star@@ s and enjo@@ y their inc@@ redi@@ ble results .
h@@ ope@@ fully , the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in L@@ on@@ d@@ on remain in history because of U@@ sa@@ in b@@ ol@@ t and M@@ o F@@ ar@@ a@@ h , not because of terrorism or co@@ war@@ dly attacks .
E@@ nn@@ i Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i second in big air in c@@ op@@ per M@@ oun@@ tain - &quot; I@@ t was so close &quot;
S@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der E@@ nn@@ i Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i fin@@ ished second in big air in a World C@@ up competition in C@@ ol@@ or@@ ad@@ o .
this second place in c@@ op@@ per M@@ oun@@ tain is Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i &apos;s best result in big air in the World C@@ up .
the competition was w@@ on by J@@ a@@ mi@@ e An@@ der@@ son from the USA .
Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i s@@ co@@ red 14@@ 7 points .
on her last j@@ um@@ p , she attemp@@ ted c@@ ab@@ all@@ er@@ ial 10@@ 80 for the first time in a competition , and very ne@@ arly made it .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m feel@@ ing good right now , but I &apos;@@ m also a little an@@ no@@ yed because the last j@@ um@@ p was so close .
but I will try it again in other compet@@ itions , &quot; Ru@@ ka@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ v@@ i said .
in big air , compet@@ itors per@@ form tric@@ ks after laun@@ ching off very large ju@@ mp@@ s .
V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine &apos;s new f@@ ast ship stu@@ ck in port in Hel@@ sin@@ ki
V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine &apos;s new f@@ ast ship F@@ S@@ T@@ R is b@@ ad@@ ly behind sch@@ edu@@ le .
the ship was set to de@@ part from Hel@@ sin@@ ki to T@@ all@@ in@@ n at 6 p@@ m .
the ship was still being lo@@ ad@@ ed at 8 p@@ m .
it arri@@ ved in Hel@@ sin@@ ki behind sch@@ edu@@ le .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been waiting for at least an h@@ our and a half to get on board .
now , the line of c@@ ars is moving s@@ low@@ ly , &quot; said Joh@@ ann@@ es Re@@ ban@@ e from Es@@ ton@@ ia waiting for embar@@ ka@@ tion at the Por@@ t of Hel@@ sin@@ ki at 7 : 30 p@@ m .
Re@@ ban@@ e sus@@ pec@@ ted that the new ship suffer@@ ed from a technical fa@@ ult .
Re@@ ban@@ e said that employees of the ship@@ ping company had provided those waiting for embar@@ ka@@ tion in their c@@ ars with water b@@ ot@@ t@@ les .
Ch@@ r@@ is@@ ta G@@ rö@@ n@@ l@@ und , press manag@@ er of V@@ ik@@ ing L@@ ine , said to is that the ship had a technical fa@@ ult .
however , it was re@@ pa@@ ired at the Por@@ t of Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
the ship will de@@ part from Hel@@ sin@@ ki a few hours behind sch@@ edu@@ le .
G@@ rö@@ n@@ l@@ und said that the ship will also be a few hours late when re@@ turning from T@@ all@@ in@@ n .
the ship was set to return from T@@ all@@ in@@ n to Hel@@ sin@@ ki at 8 : 15 p@@ m .

nos@@ tal@@ gia goes n@@ ic@@ he in &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Sum@@ mer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de de@@ te@@ c@@ tive &quot;
so this ite@@ ration of the s@@ tory is si@@ mul@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously nos@@ tal@@ gic for the charac@@ ters &apos; &apos; 8@@ 0@@ s g@@ l@@ ory days ; for the &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s g@@ run@@ ge er@@ a ( around when the mas@@ termin@@ ds D@@ avi@@ d W@@ a@@ in and M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter made the s@@ ket@@ ch com@@ ed@@ y &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ T@@ V ) ; and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its star@@ s , like E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h Ban@@ ks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and P@@ au@@ l R@@ ud@@ d , w@@ ent on to b@@ ig@@ ger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it &apos;s both a s@@ end@@ up and emb@@ od@@ im@@ ent of our F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok@@ -@@ enab@@ led er@@ a of permanent re@@ minis@@ c@@ ence .
but as a fran@@ ch@@ ise , it fe@@ els like it &apos;s running out of time .
&quot; first D@@ ay of C@@ am@@ p &quot; worked surpris@@ ingly well , not just because of its ab@@ sur@@ dis@@ t hu@@ m@@ or ( it included an origin s@@ tory for a talking can of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , vo@@ ic@@ ed by H@@ . J@@ on B@@ en@@ ja@@ min ) .
by doub@@ ling down on the cor@@ e ga@@ g - mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age ac@@ tors playing hor@@ n@@ y kid@@ s coming of age - it made the im@@ possibility of rec@@ ap@@ turing the past part of the jo@@ ke .
&quot; ten Y@@ e@@ ars later , &quot; with its ad@@ ul@@ ts now playing ad@@ ul@@ ts , is less em@@ o@@ tion@@ ally ro@@ o@@ ted and its par@@ ody more sc@@ at@@ ter@@ sho@@ t , including a ri@@ ff on &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s s@@ tal@@ ker f@@ lic@@ ks like &quot; The H@@ and Th@@ at ro@@ cks the cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point a charac@@ ter r@@ um@@ ma@@ ges through an app@@ le P@@ ow@@ er@@ bo@@ ok , some in@@ -@@ line s@@ ka@@ tes and &quot; a b@@ un@@ ch of other things from 199@@ 1 . &quot;
many of the cor@@ e stor@@ ies are the same .
S@@ we@@ et@@ -@@ hear@@ ted Co@@ o@@ p ( M@@ r@@ . S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter ) , now a no@@ vel@@ ist , still has@@ n &apos;@@ t g@@ ot@@ ten over K@@ ati@@ e ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite M@@ ore@@ a@@ u ) .

and there &apos;s another b@@ at@@ ti@@ ly vill@@ ain@@ ous plo@@ t involving R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an ( also M@@ r@@ . S@@ ho@@ w@@ al@@ ter ) , now ab@@ et@@ ted by Geor@@ ge H@@ . W@@ . Bush ( a w@@ ell@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted impression by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el I@@ an B@@ lack ) .
as always , the best part of the fran@@ ch@@ ise is the dig@@ res@@ sions .
it &apos;s especially fu@@ n to see the fore@@ ver@@ -@@ young M@@ r@@ . R@@ ud@@ d , s@@ porting M@@ at@@ t D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sou@@ l pat@@ ch from &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former b@@ ig@@ -@@ man@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ cam@@ p An@@ d@@ y now fe@@ els like a ge@@ ez@@ er .
it &apos;s the mom@@ ents of ran@@ dom l@@ un@@ acy that might power this fran@@ ch@@ ise on , like a kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive &quot; S@@ even U@@ p ! &quot; series , until it reac@@ hes what I assume will be its log@@ ical conclusion : &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Sum@@ mer : twenty Y@@ e@@ ars later , &quot; whose last sc@@ ene will have the gan@@ g going to see the mo@@ vi@@ e pre@@ mi@@ ere of &quot; w@@ et ho@@ t American Sum@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ ra@@ de de@@ te@@ c@@ tive &quot; on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , mean@@ while , appe@@ als to a different br@@ and of nos@@ tal@@ gia : the C@@ old W@@ ar re@@ vi@@ val@@ ism of &quot; The Americ@@ ans , &quot; the fil@@ m &quot; A@@ tom@@ ic b@@ l@@ on@@ de &quot; and even &quot; g@@ low , &quot; with its East ver@@ su@@ s W@@ est w@@ res@@ t@@ ling ic@@ on@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y .
the com@@ ed@@ y , created by B@@ rian G@@ a@@ te@@ w@@ ood and Al@@ es@@ san@@ d@@ ro T@@ an@@ a@@ ka , with R@@ hy@@ s Th@@ om@@ as direc@@ ting , pur@@ ports to be found T@@ V : a Roman@@ ian 198@@ 0@@ s bud@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ co@@ p dra@@ ma about two Bu@@ char@@ est offic@@ ers fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the Mar@@ x@@ ist@@ -@@ L@@ en@@ inis@@ t way .
the lead ro@@ les - har@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ iled G@@ reg@@ or and ide@@ alis@@ tic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by F@@ lor@@ in P@@ ier@@ si@@ c J@@ r@@ . and Cor@@ n@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , their dialogue du@@ b@@ bed in Eng@@ lis@@ h by Ch@@ ann@@ ing T@@ atu@@ m ( also an execu@@ tive produc@@ er ) and J@@ os@@ ep@@ h G@@ ord@@ on@@ -@@ L@@ ev@@ it@@ t .
it &apos;s a bri@@ lli@@ ant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some fine si@@ ght g@@ ag@@ s ( the police pass the time w@@ at@@ ching ch@@ ess on T@@ V as Americ@@ ans might foot@@ b@@ all ) .
and the ros@@ ter of fam@@ ous vo@@ ic@@ e@@ -@@ over ac@@ tors - among them J@@ enn@@ y s@@ late , N@@ ic@@ k O@@ ff@@ er@@ man , Ma@@ her@@ sh@@ ala Al@@ i and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a dec@@ ent ga@@ me of sp@@ ot@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ voice .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de de@@ te@@ c@@ tive &quot; is so committed to the ver@@ is@@ im@@ il@@ it@@ ude of a ha@@ m@@ fis@@ ted pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da dra@@ ma - a kill@@ er we@@ aring a Re@@ ag@@ an m@@ ask is involved - that it often pla@@ ys like one .
at six long ep@@ is@@ od@@ es , it dra@@ gs , and the com@@ ed@@ y is@@ n &apos;@@ t f@@ ast or frequ@@ ent enough .
ed@@ ited to a ti@@ gh@@ ter l@@ eng@@ th , &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de de@@ te@@ c@@ tive &quot; might del@@ iv@@ er better on its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sa@@ ti@@ re , as when G@@ reg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef repe@@ a@@ tedly visit the American E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y , whose lob@@ by is always occu@@ pi@@ ed by two f@@ at men w@@ ol@@ f@@ ing down a p@@ ile of ha@@ m@@ b@@ urg@@ ers .
the message , for the imag@@ ined commun@@ ist au@@ di@@ ence , is that W@@ estern culture can turn anything into f@@ od@@ der to bin@@ ge .
the fic@@ tional Roman@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history , and the@@ ir@@ s .
T@@ oni T@@ a@@ ur@@ u from K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a is ready to fight in Mac@@ a@@ u on Sa@@ tur@@ day - against a former U@@ F@@ C fi@@ gh@@ ter
T@@ oni T@@ a@@ ur@@ u wants to keep the fight going .
T@@ oni T@@ a@@ ur@@ u will face a tou@@ gh op@@ pon@@ ent in Mac@@ a@@ o , as Le@@ and@@ ro Is@@ sa from B@@ ra@@ z@@ il f@@ ought in the ultima@@ te Fi@@ ghting Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ship ( U@@ F@@ C ) last year .
the B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian also has a b@@ lack bel@@ t in j@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u and he has w@@ on the World J@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ J@@ it@@ s@@ u Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships .
&quot; for once , I &apos;@@ m fighting an op@@ pon@@ ent who is ol@@ der than me ,
and that &apos;@@ l@@ l be fu@@ n , &quot; says T@@ a@@ ur@@ u , 32 .
origin@@ ally , the fight was to be held in Indon@@ es@@ ia last Sa@@ tur@@ day .
however , the event was can@@ cell@@ ed due to log@@ is@@ tical problems , but three fi@@ ghts were quickly mo@@ ved to Mac@@ a@@ u .
T@@ a@@ ur@@ u has never experienc@@ ed anything like this before .
&quot; this was the first time my fight was can@@ cell@@ ed .
it was an@@ no@@ ying , as it took a lot of time training and prepar@@ ation . &quot;
however , the fi@@ gh@@ ter was happy to see that the fight was res@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed .
one week of waiting does not cause many changes in prepar@@ ations .
&quot; this move do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t change my p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal condition , as it can &apos;@@ t be much improved in a week .
however , it can get worse if I tra@@ in too hard . &quot;
in some of his previous fi@@ ghts , T@@ a@@ ur@@ u has faced op@@ pon@@ ents whose streng@@ ths were in stand@@ -@@ up fighting .
this time it is a different s@@ tory .
T@@ a@@ ur@@ u descri@@ b@@ es Is@@ sa as a typ@@ ical B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian fi@@ gh@@ ter .
&quot; he &apos;s fair@@ ly ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive .
my gu@@ ess is that he &apos;@@ l@@ l come at me hard in the first round , trying to kno@@ ck me down .
he knows how to w@@ res@@ t@@ le . after all , he has w@@ on the World J@@ i@@ u@@ -@@ J@@ it@@ s@@ u Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships . &quot;
T@@ a@@ ur@@ u &apos;s last fight did not go according to plan .
K@@ ev@@ in Bel@@ ing@@ on from the P@@ hil@@ ip@@ p@@ ines lan@@ ded a n@@ as@@ ty b@@ low in the cor@@ ner of T@@ a@@ ur@@ u &apos;s e@@ ye and claim@@ ed the w@@ in .
&quot; it was my best fight , especially standing up : he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t land a single pun@@ ch .
when I tried to take him down , he h@@ it me in the e@@ ye .
I felt bad about it for a long time . &quot;
new mo@@ ti@@ vation
some fi@@ gh@@ ters have a few mat@@ ches a year , while some fight more frequ@@ ently .
for example , Is@@ sa &apos;s last fight was in September ,
while T@@ a@@ ur@@ u had three fi@@ ghts last year .
this will be the second fight of the year .
the p@@ ace has felt he@@ av@@ y at times .
&quot; in recent years , I &apos;@@ ve train@@ ed and been f@@ it all the time .
however , I &apos;@@ ve only f@@ ought for the sa@@ ke of fighting . &quot;
when the 3@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old heard about the up@@ coming fac@@ e@@ -@@ off , he felt that he needed a change of sc@@ ener@@ y .
&quot; I was training in Es@@ po@@ o and started to enjo@@ y all of this again .
the inten@@ s@@ ity of training was really high , as there was also one fi@@ gh@@ ter from Sweden . &quot;
a good p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal condition will be needed on Sa@@ tur@@ day when T@@ a@@ ur@@ u must be ready for a tou@@ gh mat@@ ch .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve s@@ par@@ red against op@@ pon@@ ents of the same siz@@ e and train@@ ed stand@@ -@@ up fighting . &quot;
the 3@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old intends to sta@@ y standing .
&quot; I need to be s@@ mar@@ t when I strik@@ e .
if an opportunity pres@@ ents itself , I must be ready to take it .
I can &apos;@@ t let him take me to the ground without a fight , as it consum@@ es the most energy . &quot;
Mac@@ a@@ u is an at@@ trac@@ tive loc@@ ation for T@@ a@@ ur@@ u who has also f@@ ought in China before .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve heard that it &apos;s the L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as of China .
I &apos;@@ m certain that it &apos;@@ l@@ l be a great night . &quot;
Bank of Eng@@ land to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of Eng@@ land is expected to announ@@ ce later that interest rates will remain un@@ changed after la@@ c@@ kl@@ us@@ tr@@ e economic growth and eas@@ ing inf@@ lation da@@ mp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a h@@ ik@@ e .
the Bank of Eng@@ land has war@@ ned economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; as it kept interest rates on hold a@@ mid a ti@@ gh@@ tening s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e on family in@@ comes .
polic@@ y@@ ma@@ kers on the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( M@@ P@@ C ) voted 6@@ -@@ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fe@@ wer members this month calling for a rise as la@@ c@@ kl@@ us@@ tr@@ e economic growth has wea@@ ken@@ ed support for a h@@ ik@@ e .
in its quar@@ ter@@ ly inf@@ lation report , the Bank cut its fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ts for growth to 1.@@ 7 % in 20@@ 17 and 1.@@ 6 % in 20@@ 18 and cau@@ tioned the s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e on hou@@ se@@ hold in@@ comes would continue , with inf@@ lation still expected to sur@@ ge close to 3 % in the autu@@ m@@ n .
but it sig@@ n@@ all@@ ed rate h@@ ik@@ es will be needed over the next few years to re@@ in in B@@ re@@ x@@ it@@ -@@ fu@@ ell@@ ed inf@@ lation and said bor@@ ro@@ wing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
Members also voted to with@@ draw part of the ma@@ m@@ m@@ oth econom@@ y@@ -@@ bo@@ os@@ ting package un@@ le@@ as@@ hed a year ago in the after@@ mat@@ h of B@@ re@@ x@@ it .
it will call time on the T@@ er@@ m F@@ und@@ ing Sch@@ em@@ e to offer che@@ ap@@ -@@ finance to ban@@ ks from next February , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 1@@ 15 billion .
in minu@@ tes of the rates decision , the Bank said : &quot; in the M@@ P@@ C &apos;s central fo@@ rec@@ ast , gro@@ s@@ s domestic product ( G@@ D@@ P ) remains s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish in the ne@@ ar@@ -@@ term as the s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e on hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds &apos; real in@@ comes continues to w@@ ei@@ gh on consumption . &quot;
on rates , it reite@@ rated that &quot; some ti@@ gh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to co@@ ol inf@@ lation and by a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than markets expect .
markets are currently fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ting the first rise in the third quar@@ ter of next year and another in 20@@ 20 .
but the Bank stres@@ sed that any h@@ ik@@ es would be &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s do@@ w@@ n@@ gra@@ ded growth fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ts for this year and next compar@@ e with the 1.@@ 9 % and 1.@@ 7 % pre@@ dic@@ ted in May .
it maintained its fo@@ rec@@ ast for growth of 1.@@ 8 % in 20@@ 18 .
ster@@ ling fel@@ l against the doll@@ ar and the euro following the ne@@ ws .
the p@@ ound was 0.@@ 5 % down at 1.@@ 31 US doll@@ ars and fel@@ l 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euro@@ s .
the no@@ -@@ change decision comes after recent disap@@ poin@@ ting growth figures have da@@ mp@@ ened moun@@ ting expectations of a h@@ ik@@ e , with G@@ D@@ P ed@@ ging up to 0.@@ 3 % in the second quar@@ ter from 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months .
growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quar@@ ter , although it will start to pic@@ k up sli@@ ghtly at the end of the year , according to the Bank .
its latest inf@@ lation report offer@@ ed little che@@ er for hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds being h@@ it by so@@ aring inf@@ lation and pal@@ try pay ris@@ es as it said the s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e will get worse before it gets better .
it added that monetary policy &quot; cannot prevent &quot; the h@@ it to in@@ comes over the next few years , but ex@@ pects w@@ ages will rec@@ over &quot; signific@@ antly &quot; towards the end of its thre@@ e@@ -@@ year fo@@ rec@@ ast .
the economy is also set for a bo@@ ost from sur@@ ging demand for British goods thanks to the wea@@ k p@@ ound , which will off@@ set some of the lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last A@@ ug@@ ust following the sho@@ ck EU referendum vote , which sent the p@@ ound s@@ lu@@ mp@@ ing .
the Bank estima@@ tes it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
pri@@ or to the Bank &apos;s latest rates ver@@ dic@@ t , there had been growing cla@@ m@@ our for a rate rise as inf@@ lation ra@@ mp@@ ed up pressure on har@@ d@@ -@@ pres@@ sed hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , with three polic@@ y@@ ma@@ kers calling for an increase to 0.@@ 5 % in July .
inf@@ lation e@@ ased back to 2@@ .@@ 6 % last month from 2@@ .@@ 9 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will pic@@ k up once again over the coming months .
the Bank said the over@@ sho@@ ot rela@@ tive to its 2 % target was &quot; entirely &quot; down to the wea@@ k p@@ ound .
An@@ dre@@ w Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , direc@@ tor at Co@@ rec@@ o mor@@ t@@ g@@ age bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent fall in s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mor@@ t@@ g@@ age market loo@@ ks set to become ever more competitive once more as l@@ end@@ ers cla@@ m@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fas@@ hi@@ on .
the market loo@@ ks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing de@@ als as re@@ -@@ mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages , many with fe@@ e@@ -@@ free op@@ tions as well as low rates , become ever more pop@@ ular . &quot;
N@@ H@@ S to pres@@ cri@@ be contro@@ versi@@ al H@@ I@@ V dru@@ g to 10@@ ,@@ 000
pati@@ ents will be able to access a &apos; trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive &apos; H@@ I@@ V prevention treatment from September following a Hi@@ gh Court b@@ attle over funding the dru@@ g on the N@@ H@@ S .
N@@ H@@ S Eng@@ land announced that pre@@ -@@ ex@@ pos@@ ure pro@@ p@@ hy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( P@@ r@@ E@@ P ) , a p@@ ill taken before se@@ x which has been shown to reduce the risk of inf@@ ec@@ tion in hi@@ gh@@ -@@ risk individuals by around 8@@ 6 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial thre@@ e@@ -@@ year trial to an estima@@ ted 10@@ ,@@ 000 people .
it agreed to fund the trial after the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al up@@ held a Hi@@ gh Court r@@ ul@@ ing last year , which said the N@@ H@@ S had the power to pay for P@@ r@@ E@@ P despite its claim@@ s that local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Th@@ urs@@ day was ha@@ iled as a &apos; major new intervention &apos; by N@@ H@@ S Eng@@ land ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive S@@ im@@ on S@@ te@@ ven@@ s while the N@@ ational A@@ id@@ s T@@ r@@ ust ( N@@ A@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pi@@ vo@@ tal moment &apos; .
sexual health c@@ lin@@ ics in L@@ on@@ d@@ on , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ ol and S@@ he@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to start en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ing people , with more c@@ lin@@ ics join@@ ing in October before full implementation across Eng@@ land by April 20@@ 18 .
P@@ re@@ -@@ ex@@ pos@@ ure pro@@ p@@ hy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( P@@ r@@ E@@ P ) is a course of H@@ I@@ V drugs taken before se@@ x to reduce the risk of getting H@@ I@@ V .
tri@@ als have shown P@@ r@@ E@@ P signific@@ antly reduc@@ es H@@ I@@ V trans@@ mission among those at@@ -@@ risk of inf@@ ec@@ tion .
taking P@@ r@@ E@@ P before se@@ x means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person &apos;s body to prevent an H@@ I@@ V inf@@ ec@@ tion taking hold .
such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having se@@ x .
those eli@@ gible for the treatment include g@@ ay or b@@ is@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and those with H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ positive partners who are not success@@ fully receiv@@ ing treatment .
c@@ lin@@ ics will identi@@ fy eli@@ gible partici@@ pan@@ ts who con@@ sent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a part@@ ner whose H@@ I@@ V status is not known to be controll@@ ed by anti@@ -@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people living and regis@@ tered with a G@@ P in Eng@@ land will also be able to en@@ ro@@ l for potential participation at their local particip@@ ating sexual health c@@ lin@@ ic .
the programme will cost £ 10 million and N@@ H@@ S Eng@@ land signed a contrac@@ t to source the drugs this week following an international competitive proc@@ ure@@ ment .
the trial is designed to ass@@ ess the full potential of P@@ r@@ E@@ P by ga@@ ther@@ ing c@@ lin@@ ical evidence on how it is tar@@ ge@@ ted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
Mr S@@ te@@ ven@@ s said : &apos; this major new intervention should compl@@ ement and super@@ charge the w@@ ide@@ -@@ rang@@ ing and increasingly successful effort to prevent H@@ I@@ V .
it &apos;s another mil@@ es@@ t@@ one in more than three dec@@ ad@@ es &apos; worth of progress in tac@@ kl@@ ing one of human@@ ity &apos;s major health challenges . &apos;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ a@@ h G@@ old , ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive at N@@ A@@ T ( N@@ ational A@@ id@@ s T@@ r@@ ust ) , said : &apos; this is a pi@@ vo@@ tal moment in the fight against H@@ I@@ V .
P@@ r@@ E@@ P , if tar@@ ge@@ ted properly at those in need and at risk , off@@ ers the possibility of trans@@ form@@ ing the Eng@@ lis@@ h H@@ I@@ V ep@@ idem@@ ic .

living the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and cle@@ ver des@@ ign tric@@ ks have trans@@ for@@ med this small E@@ ar@@ ls Court f@@ l@@ at into a sp@@ ac@@ ious home
J@@ o@@ ann@@ e L@@ ei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a pas@@ sion for doing up proper@@ ty , do@@ w@@ n@@ sized from a large home in K@@ ni@@ gh@@ t@@ s@@ br@@ id@@ ge to an E@@ ar@@ ls Court a@@ part@@ ment in 20@@ 14 .
it is on the first floor of a s@@ mar@@ t Qu@@ een A@@ nne ter@@ ra@@ ce - and it is a te@@ sta@@ ment to the new des@@ ign that J@@ o@@ ann@@ e has@@ n &apos;@@ t pac@@ ked her b@@ ag@@ s and sol@@ d on .
&quot; before this , I was living with my e@@ x in K@@ ni@@ gh@@ t@@ s@@ br@@ id@@ ge in a much b@@ ig@@ ger space , &quot; J@@ o@@ ann@@ e says .
&quot; I was looking for something that was compar@@ able for my price .
I was shown this a@@ part@@ ment in E@@ ar@@ ls Court and it had the same high c@@ eil@@ ings .
I fel@@ l in lo@@ ve with it and put an offer in that day . &quot;
since the first vie@@ wing , the 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ s@@ q ft f@@ l@@ at has had a complete over@@ ha@@ u@@ l .
origin@@ ally a one@@ -@@ b@@ ed@@ room proper@@ ty with a con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted la@@ y@@ out - you had to w@@ al@@ k through the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en to get to the b@@ ed@@ room - J@@ o@@ ann@@ e wanted to add stor@@ age space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the gener@@ ous c@@ eil@@ ing he@@ ight .
&quot; I wanted high c@@ eil@@ ings , big w@@ in@@ do@@ ws , lo@@ ts of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she employed E@@ r@@ f@@ an Az@@ ad@@ i of N@@ ot@@ ting H@@ ill@@ -@@ based ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture and des@@ ign stu@@ di@@ o D@@ uc@@ k &a@@ mp@@ ; S@@ hed to explo@@ it the 12@@ .@@ 5@@ ft c@@ eil@@ ings and create a home that w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t only a development but a place for J@@ o@@ ann@@ e to live .
the c@@ eil@@ ing w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t quite tal@@ l enough to add two sp@@ ac@@ es on top of each other so the ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ tural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
E@@ r@@ f@@ an had to think cre@@ ati@@ vely to resolve the brief .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite compl@@ icated , &quot; he expla@@ ins .
&quot; we had to ar@@ range the sp@@ ac@@ es so that they sta@@ c@@ ked on top of each other without need@@ ing to hun@@ ch down .
it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t just building a simple pla@@ t@@ form , but c@@ ran@@ king the ste@@ els so that they were at the right he@@ ight for the function above or bel@@ ow . &quot;
this arrang@@ ement allowed E@@ r@@ f@@ an to get two fu@@ ll@@ -@@ he@@ ight ro@@ oms on top of each other in the space - with lo@@ ts of added dra@@ ma .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a vin@@ ta@@ ge c@@ op@@ per light w@@ in@@ do@@ w from R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us loo@@ ks down over the gla@@ mo@@ ro@@ us living area bel@@ ow .
mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red g@@ old fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure , sil@@ ver acc@@ ents and vin@@ ta@@ ge Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ill@@ e li@@ ghting all set the sty@@ le for the scheme .
the use of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ rs pla@@ ys a part in ad@@ ding the@@ at@@ re , space and light .
a short cor@@ rid@@ or is mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red s@@ pl@@ ash@@ back fe@@ els like a w@@ in@@ do@@ w to another room .
at the entr@@ ance , mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red un@@ its provide stor@@ age for all J@@ o@@ ann@@ e &apos;s c@@ ut@@ l@@ ery and g@@ l@@ ass@@ w@@ are .
giving the perc@@ ep@@ tion of a more gla@@ mo@@ ro@@ us space , the be@@ au@@ ty of the living room is being able to close off the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en when it &apos;s not in use .
F@@ ol@@ da@@ way k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens are nothing new .
what &apos;s uni@@ que about this one is that it &apos;s a gar@@ ag@@ e@@ -@@ sty@@ le lif@@ t@@ -@@ up do@@ or .
&quot; a bit of eng@@ ine@@ ering w@@ ent into that , &quot; expla@@ ins E@@ r@@ f@@ an of the ste@@ el@@ -@@ reinfor@@ ced , ven@@ e@@ ered M@@ D@@ F do@@ or .
&quot; it &apos;s coun@@ ter@@ -@@ w@@ ei@@ ghted so that when you pus@@ h the do@@ or up , it g@@ l@@ id@@ es really easi@@ ly . &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver use of space and stor@@ age , J@@ o@@ ann@@ e gain@@ ed an additional 16@@ s@@ q m , an ex@@ tra b@@ ed@@ room and an improved la@@ y@@ out .
&quot; at the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sel@@ l - or how your proper@@ ty is valu@@ ed , &quot; E@@ r@@ f@@ an says .
&quot; in a r@@ ud@@ imen@@ tary form , a real es@@ ta@@ te ag@@ ent will w@@ al@@ k in and do a cal@@ c@@ ulation based on floor siz@@ e . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materi@@ als that give the space its lu@@ x@@ uri@@ ous ed@@ ge .
&quot; the materi@@ als are the things that you tou@@ ch and therefore help to create an em@@ o@@ tional b@@ ond in a home , &quot; says E@@ r@@ f@@ an .
&quot; you d@@ on &apos;@@ t fall in lo@@ ve with the elec@@ tr@@ ical fe@@ ed@@ s in the w@@ all@@ s .
these are important but they d@@ on &apos;@@ t pul@@ l the heart str@@ ings . &quot;
it goes to show that through good des@@ ign and increased s@@ qu@@ are met@@ re@@ age , a f@@ l@@ at can turn from something standard into something quite a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing .
in fact , like J@@ o@@ ann@@ e , you may choose not to leave .

she te@@ ac@@ hes us with s@@ we@@ et ch@@ ill@@ i
in sum@@ mer 1996 , a bo@@ oth was set up in the La@@ h@@ ti market s@@ qu@@ are sell@@ ing T@@ ha@@ i food .
those living in La@@ h@@ ti d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the courage to have a tas@@ te , they simply w@@ al@@ ked by .
the bo@@ oth was set up by P@@ any@@ a Su@@ am@@ s@@ ri@@ -@@ P@@ ent@@ til@@ ä , or P@@ an@@ ja to those who knows her .
she bar@@ ely spoke F@@ inn@@ ish , and the T@@ ha@@ i language w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t wid@@ ely spoken in Fin@@ land at the time .
because people d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have the courage to go and e@@ at , P@@ an@@ ja offer@@ ed free b@@ ite@@ s .
and so she tau@@ ght everyone living in La@@ h@@ ti how to e@@ at T@@ ha@@ i food , one s@@ pr@@ ing ro@@ l@@ l at a time .
&quot; go on , tas@@ te it , tas@@ te it , &quot; she said .
I was immediately ho@@ ok@@ ed .
I used to go more often , even@@ tually every day .
in sum@@ mer 1997 , P@@ an@@ ja open@@ ed a T@@ ha@@ i res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in the La@@ h@@ ti market h@@ all .
it consis@@ ted of two small tab@@ les , with room for no more than 20 custom@@ ers .
not only did she te@@ ach us to e@@ at T@@ ha@@ i food , but also to sit next to str@@ ang@@ ers .
when you &apos;@@ re hun@@ g@@ ry and not many se@@ ats are available , you can &apos;@@ t leave an emp@@ ty se@@ at between y@@ our@@ self and a str@@ ang@@ er .
s@@ low@@ ly , we got to know each other better and bec@@ a@@ me friends .
finally , I s@@ at there e@@ ating , reading a dic@@ tionary and trying to learn the T@@ ha@@ i language .
the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant oper@@ ated in the market h@@ all for two years , after which it had to move because it was said that the ar@@ om@@ as from P@@ an@@ ja &apos;s hom@@ em@@ ade curr@@ y pas@@ tes were too inten@@ se .
a new spo@@ t bec@@ a@@ me available at the end of the market h@@ all ,
with more space .
now we can be g@@ ru@@ mp@@ y at our own tab@@ les . only during the bu@@ si@@ est hours do we need to ti@@ mid@@ ly ask str@@ ang@@ ers whether the se@@ at next to them is available .
P@@ an@@ ja knows her custom@@ ers .
we tell her how we are doing , where we have been and who we have seen .
she knows what each of us e@@ ats .
she has seen how her custom@@ ers pass from one situation on to the next and how their d@@ inn@@ er compan@@ ions change .
she re@@ members the name of the man with whom I had my first s@@ pr@@ ing ro@@ ll@@ s .
she re@@ members when I was s@@ k@@ inn@@ y and when I was f@@ at , and she knows what I was like when I was youn@@ ger .
it &apos;s n@@ ice to have l@@ un@@ ch after everyone else , take a se@@ at in my own place next to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en do@@ or and talk this and that with P@@ an@@ ja who is le@@ an@@ ing on the b@@ ar .
food is@@ n &apos;@@ t the most important thing she has given us .
she has tau@@ ght us toler@@ ance and given us a world view , ser@@ ved with s@@ we@@ et ch@@ ill@@ i .
in addition to our sense of tas@@ te , she has open@@ ed up our hear@@ ts and min@@ ds .
now , many speak to her in T@@ ha@@ i - thanks to more exten@@ sive travel opportunities .
I ad@@ mi@@ re P@@ an@@ ja .
she &apos;s always friend@@ ly , even though she too has faced tou@@ gh times .
she works hard .
in addition to her days in the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant , she enjo@@ ys pic@@ king mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms and bil@@ ber@@ ries .
last week , we qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly cel@@ eb@@ rated the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant .
P@@ an@@ ja ser@@ ved us custom@@ ers stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry ca@@ ke for d@@ ess@@ er@@ t .
there was no f@@ us@@ s or big noise to mark the event ; it was just another day at work .
dis@@ covered under@@ ground base re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed 17@@ 3 I@@ S@@ I@@ S terroris@@ ts ready to strik@@ e in Europe
earlier this year , security authorities got their hands on a significant list considering the b@@ attle against terrorism .
the list contains information about more than 1@@ 70 I@@ S@@ I@@ S terroris@@ ts who are ready to attack in Europe .
according to German Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , there are 17@@ 3 lis@@ ted persons in total , and the list includes personal details and p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of each individual .
of the lis@@ ted persons , 1@@ 30 come from Iraq , but there are also six Europeans
from Belgi@@ um , the Netherlands , France and Germany .
others are from Tun@@ isia , Morocc@@ o , J@@ ord@@ an , T@@ aj@@ ik@@ istan and Sa@@ ud@@ i Ara@@ bia .
I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at re@@ ported the dis@@ co@@ very of the list two weeks ago .
now , the loc@@ ation where the list was found and the information it contains have been speci@@ fied .
according to Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , special forces of the Iraqi ar@@ my found the list , contain@@ ing personal details and p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of terroris@@ ts , as they were going through an under@@ ground base of I@@ S@@ I@@ S in Mos@@ u@@ l .
us intell@@ ig@@ ence authorities examin@@ ed the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the documents and for@@ war@@ ded them to Inter@@ po@@ l .
Inter@@ po@@ l distribu@@ ted the list to the security authorities of all European countries in May .
there were fe@@ ars that terroris@@ ts were planning something large and serious in the w@@ est , as I@@ S@@ I@@ S was taken down in the Middle East .
according to Di@@ e W@@ el@@ t , the list contains the na@@ mes and p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of all lis@@ ted persons , as well as their da@@ tes of b@@ ir@@ th , ali@@ ases and information about their home country .
the list also speci@@ f@@ ies the speci@@ al@@ ty of each terrorist .
for example , the ali@@ as of S@@ am@@ i J@@ . , a 2@@ 7@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old from Germany , is A@@ b@@ u As@@ si@@ d al@@ -@@ Al@@ man@@ i , or the German .
the list says that he left Germany in 20@@ 12 , going first to Egyp@@ t , followed by Li@@ by@@ a and Turkey , before he w@@ ent to S@@ y@@ ria to join I@@ S@@ I@@ S .
next to his p@@ ho@@ to , su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ ber is written as his speci@@ al@@ ty .
it is not known what has happened to him .
rou@@ gh@@ ly 6@@ ,@@ 000 fi@@ gh@@ ters , whose des@@ tin@@ y is un@@ known , have left Europe to join I@@ S@@ I@@ S .

bro@@ th@@ ers fight over $ 500 million proper@@ ty emp@@ ire
two bro@@ th@@ ers are at war over one of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s b@@ ig@@ g@@ est real es@@ ta@@ te em@@ pi@@ res , worth more than $ 500 million , four dec@@ ad@@ es after their Italian family foun@@ ded the d@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty .
former Car@@ l@@ ton F@@ o@@ ot@@ b@@ all C@@ lu@@ b direc@@ tor and develop@@ er C@@ ol@@ in D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s lives in a T@@ o@@ or@@ a@@ k man@@ sion three do@@ ors from youn@@ ger bro@@ ther P@@ au@@ l , who has taken him to the Su@@ pre@@ me Court over how their proper@@ ty and business ass@@ ets will be s@@ lic@@ ed up .
P@@ au@@ l has wanted out of the family business since 20@@ 14 but an ac@@ r@@ im@@ on@@ ious argument is playing out in the Su@@ pre@@ me Court over the bre@@ ak@@ -@@ up .
together with their mo@@ ther A@@ nn@@ a the bro@@ th@@ ers own 38 proper@@ ties worth more than half a billion doll@@ ars , am@@ ass@@ ed since the family b@@ ought a S@@ mit@@ h S@@ tre@@ et , C@@ oll@@ ing@@ w@@ ood , sho@@ p in 197@@ 3 .
there , the family foun@@ ded W@@ es@@ t@@ co je@@ ans and gre@@ w it into a cha@@ in of 1@@ 60 re@@ ta@@ il out@@ l@@ ets .
it sol@@ d in 1999 for $ 8@@ 5 million .
that money was su@@ n@@ k into proper@@ ty and the D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o now includes c@@ ity offic@@ es , Br@@ un@@ s@@ w@@ ic@@ k and S@@ or@@ ren@@ to development si@@ tes , G@@ old Co@@ ast and M@@ t Bu@@ ll@@ er a@@ part@@ ments , and sub@@ ur@@ ban sh@@ opp@@ ing cent@@ res .
under an agreement with their late fa@@ ther , C@@ ol@@ in - described by P@@ au@@ l as &quot; the major dri@@ ving force and the domin@@ ant person@@ ality &quot; in the D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s family - ow@@ ns about tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of the company ass@@ ets and P@@ au@@ l about one@@ -@@ third .
a court fil@@ ing says this trans@@ la@@ tes to C@@ ol@@ in ow@@ ning proper@@ ty worth $ 3@@ 16 million and P@@ au@@ l $ 17@@ 6 million .
divid@@ ing the proper@@ ties and cas@@ h has proved the s@@ tic@@ king point for P@@ au@@ l .
&quot; the s@@ pl@@ its proposed by C@@ ol@@ in left him with what I considered to be the best proper@@ ties , &quot; he w@@ ro@@ te in an initial court aff@@ id@@ avi@@ t in 20@@ 15 .
last F@@ rid@@ ay , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first Su@@ pre@@ me Court hear@@ ing was held .
the bro@@ th@@ ers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which P@@ au@@ l all@@ eg@@ es C@@ ol@@ in has loc@@ ked him out of .
C@@ ol@@ in argu@@ es this is not true , but acc@@ uses P@@ au@@ l of in@@ compe@@ ten@@ tly manag@@ ing some proper@@ ties .
in an early aff@@ id@@ avi@@ t f@@ iled by C@@ ol@@ in , he says he hop@@ es to resolve the dispu@@ te .
&quot; my Italian her@@ ita@@ ge dicta@@ tes that family is the most important priority , &quot; he w@@ ro@@ te .
costs are moun@@ ting in the case , with hund@@ re@@ ds of pa@@ ges of aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , em@@ a@@ ils and reports by companies including D@@ elo@@ it@@ te , P@@ it@@ ch@@ er Par@@ t@@ ners and Charter K@@ ec@@ k C@@ ra@@ mer f@@ iled and top bar@@ ris@@ ters including A@@ ll@@ an M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and sen@@ i@@ or sol@@ ic@@ itors re@@ tained by both sides .
M@@ s D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s and her late h@@ us@@ b@@ and Lu@@ ig@@ i were Italian immigrants who ran mil@@ k b@@ ars and del@@ ic@@ a@@ te@@ ss@@ ens from the late 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s and in the early 197@@ 0@@ s b@@ ought a sho@@ p in Br@@ un@@ s@@ w@@ ic@@ k .
they used the coll@@ a@@ teral to bu@@ y the C@@ oll@@ ing@@ w@@ ood proper@@ ty where C@@ ol@@ in open@@ ed the family &apos;s first je@@ ans stor@@ e .
C@@ ol@@ in says he started W@@ es@@ t@@ co there when he was &quot; in my final years of high scho@@ ol , when P@@ au@@ l was a young child ( around 10 years old ) . &quot;
A@@ nn@@ a D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s says she and Lu@@ ig@@ i , who di@@ ed in 20@@ 12 , hop@@ ed to pass down their proper@@ ties to their s@@ ons am@@ ic@@ ably .
&quot; Lu@@ ig@@ i often said to me that he never wanted the bro@@ th@@ ers to end up in court , &quot; she w@@ ro@@ te .
two other bro@@ th@@ ers , Mar@@ k and Lu@@ ke , are no longer part of the D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s group of companies , with C@@ ol@@ in saying that Mar@@ k was paid $ 10 million when he left the business , and Lu@@ ke $ 26 million .
both Lu@@ ke and Mar@@ k had become , P@@ au@@ l says , &quot; b@@ itte@@ r about the terms of their financial separ@@ ation . &quot;
C@@ ol@@ in has kept a low prof@@ ile despite being a former A@@ F@@ L c@@ lu@@ b board member and , according to a 20@@ 15 bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ y of E@@ d@@ di@@ e Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the television sta@@ r &apos;s best fri@@ end .
F@@ air@@ fa@@ x Med@@ ia contac@@ ted C@@ ol@@ in and P@@ au@@ l D@@ e Lu@@ ti@@ s on F@@ rid@@ ay , and their law@@ yers .
only C@@ ol@@ in re@@ pli@@ ed , by text message , to say that because the case was before the cour@@ ts &quot; I really cannot say much . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sa@@ d that my bro@@ ther P@@ au@@ l has ch@@ os@@ en to su@@ e me and dra@@ g our family name through the cour@@ ts , &quot; he w@@ ro@@ te .
in mid@@ -@@ 20@@ 16 , C@@ ol@@ in w@@ ro@@ te in one court fil@@ ing that he had tried to ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ate his bro@@ ther &apos;s requests .
&quot; our fa@@ ther would not have wanted to see P@@ au@@ l and I end up in our current dispu@@ te , &quot; he said , ad@@ ding that he was &quot; still h@@ ope@@ ful of resolution . &quot;
on F@@ rid@@ ay , that hope appe@@ ared gone .
&quot; our matter will be resolved by the cour@@ ts in the ne@@ ar future , &quot; C@@ ol@@ in w@@ ro@@ te .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s new ch@@ i@@ ef of staff plans to restric@@ t the presid@@ ent &apos;s media di@@ et .
others have tried and failed .
ma@@ y@@ be Joh@@ n F@@ . K@@ ell@@ y can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
politic@@ o reports that the new White House ch@@ i@@ ef of staff plans to restric@@ t the flo@@ w of information to President tr@@ um@@ p - including ne@@ ws media reports - in the hope of keeping the b@@ os@@ s on a more even ke@@ el .
here &apos;s a bit from re@@ por@@ ter J@@ os@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y :
&quot; when new White House C@@ hi@@ ef of Sta@@ ff Joh@@ n F@@ . K@@ ell@@ y hu@@ d@@ d@@ led with sen@@ i@@ or staff on his first day at work , he out@@ lined a key problem in President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s White House that he planned to fi@@ x : bad information getting into the presid@@ ent &apos;s hands .
K@@ ell@@ y told the staff that information needed to flo@@ w through him - whether on paper or in bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs - because the presid@@ ent would make better decisions if given good information . &quot;
K@@ ell@@ y &apos;s di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis makes perfec@@ t sense , but others have tried and failed to ta@@ me tr@@ um@@ p by monitoring his media di@@ et .
President tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s relationship with television goes back dec@@ ad@@ es - and now that he &apos;s in the White House , his T@@ V@@ -@@ w@@ at@@ ching ha@@ bit is still going strong .
&quot; if candidate tr@@ um@@ p was up@@ set about un@@ fair cover@@ age , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair cover@@ age from out@@ l@@ ets that were per@@ su@@ ad@@ able , &quot; S@@ am N@@ un@@ ber@@ g , a former campaign advis@@ er , told Pol@@ it@@ ic@@ o in February .
politic@@ o &apos;s T@@ ar@@ a Pal@@ mer@@ i w@@ ro@@ te at the time that &quot; the key to keeping tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s T@@ wit@@ ter ha@@ bit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ad@@ y stre@@ am of p@@ raise . &quot;
o@@ ka@@ y .
but the idea that tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s T@@ wit@@ ter ha@@ bit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is la@@ ug@@ ha@@ ble .
ma@@ y@@ be these campaign officials know something the rest of us d@@ on &apos;@@ t - that tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s tw@@ e@@ ets would have been even more inf@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ tory if not for their interven@@ tions .
we &apos;@@ l@@ l probably never know about tw@@ e@@ ets that tr@@ um@@ p d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t send .
if his sta@@ ff@@ ers managed to him out of tro@@ u@@ ble even a few times , then their efforts were wor@@ th@@ while .
but no one has been able to consisten@@ tly prevent tr@@ um@@ p from sti@@ r@@ ring up contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that in a White House com@@ posed of compet@@ ing fac@@ tions , people in@@ vari@@ ably try to advan@@ ce their ag@@ end@@ as by pres@@ enting tr@@ um@@ p with material - which may or may not be reli@@ able - that promo@@ tes their wor@@ l@@ d@@ views .
politic@@ o - all over this s@@ tory - re@@ ported in May on advis@@ ers &apos; pen@@ chan@@ ts for strateg@@ ically fe@@ eding du@@ b@@ ious information to the presid@@ ent .
this was one example , described by re@@ por@@ ter S@@ han@@ e G@@ ol@@ d@@ ma@@ ch@@ er :
&quot; current and former tr@@ um@@ p officials say tr@@ um@@ p can re@@ act vol@@ can@@ ically to negative press c@@ li@@ ps , especially those with dama@@ ging lea@@ ks , becoming en@@ gro@@ s@@ sed in finding out where they origin@@ ated .
that is what happened in late February when some@@ one mis@@ ch@@ i@@ ev@@ ously gave the presid@@ ent a prin@@ ted c@@ op@@ y of an ar@@ ticle from G@@ ot@@ Ne@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m , the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e of Internet pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ te@@ ur Char@@ les C@@ . Joh@@ n@@ son , which acc@@ used de@@ pu@@ ty ch@@ i@@ ef of staff K@@ ati@@ e W@@ al@@ s@@ h of being &apos; the source behind a b@@ un@@ ch of lea@@ ks &apos; in the White House .
no matter that Joh@@ n@@ son had been perman@@ ently bann@@ ed from T@@ wit@@ ter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he offer@@ ed no concrete evidence or that he had lob@@ bed fal@@ se acc@@ us@@ ations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .
tr@@ um@@ p read the ar@@ ticle and beg@@ an asking staff about W@@ al@@ s@@ h . &quot;
G@@ ol@@ d@@ ma@@ ch@@ er added that th@@ en@@ -@@ ch@@ i@@ ef of staff Re@@ in@@ ce P@@ ri@@ eb@@ us and White House staff secre@@ tary Ro@@ b Por@@ ter &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work tr@@ um@@ p receiv@@ es . &quot;
how &apos;@@ d that work out ?
K@@ ell@@ y is trying to do the same thing , three months later .
perhaps he will prove a more effective manag@@ er than P@@ ri@@ eb@@ us , but tr@@ um@@ p is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his aid@@ es are still v@@ ying for influence .
those im@@ mu@@ table factors will make K@@ ell@@ y &apos;s mission very difficult .

the tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers were there in May , were mo@@ ved on and now they are back again .

I live on S@@ tre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ ok road and I &apos;@@ m not happy to continue pa@@ ying my coun@@ cil tax when the coun@@ cil can &apos;@@ t even stop this . &apos;

en@@ ra@@ ged people sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed cr@@ as@@ hed plan@@ e in Portugal
men who made emergency lan@@ ding on a pac@@ ked be@@ ach in Portugal were heard at court today .
as a result of the cr@@ as@@ h lan@@ ding , two people di@@ ed yesterday .
the two men who p@@ ilo@@ ted the plan@@ e may be indic@@ ted for neg@@ li@@ g@@ ent hom@@ ic@@ ide .
in Portugal , the most s@@ ev@@ ere pun@@ is@@ hment for neg@@ li@@ g@@ ent hom@@ ic@@ ide is 16 years of imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment .
a technical fa@@ ult forced the light plan@@ e p@@ ilo@@ ted by the two men to cr@@ as@@ h land on the Sa@@ o J@@ o@@ a@@ o da Ca@@ par@@ ic@@ a be@@ ach ne@@ ar Lisbon .
at the time of the cr@@ as@@ h , the be@@ ach was full of people , some of whom es@@ cap@@ ed the cr@@ as@@ hing plan@@ e by running in the water .
when lan@@ ding , the plan@@ e h@@ it a 5@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man and an 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l who di@@ ed immediately .
the plan@@ e first h@@ it the man who had his back turned towards the plan@@ e .
F@@ ili@@ pe J@@ an@@ eir@@ a who was at the be@@ ach told J@@ or@@ nal de N@@ o@@ ti@@ ci@@ as that immediately after@@ wards the plan@@ e as@@ cen@@ ded and , when it des@@ cen@@ ded again , it h@@ it the child in the head .
the dec@@ e@@ ased g@@ ir@@ l was at the be@@ ach with her par@@ ents
who were not in@@ ju@@ red .
immediately after the cr@@ as@@ h , en@@ ra@@ ged people sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed the cr@@ as@@ hed plan@@ e .
C@@ el@@ ia Ro@@ ch@@ a who wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the inc@@ ident told Cor@@ re@@ io de Man@@ ha that the g@@ ir@@ l &apos;s fa@@ ther and other people ran to the plan@@ e and started b@@ ang@@ ing on its re@@ ar .
the man called the pil@@ ot a criminal - he was des@@ per@@ ate .
it is a wonder that no more people were kill@@ ed .
the two men who p@@ ilo@@ ted the plan@@ e were not in@@ ju@@ red .

&quot; these World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships have been pre@@ tty a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing !
we &apos;@@ ve w@@ on two g@@ old med@@ als and are really pu@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; said S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i who was contac@@ ted by tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one .
the 3@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old rid@@ er than@@ ked his co@@ ach and his excellent prepar@@ ations in Fin@@ land .
according to S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i , the number of challeng@@ ers is constantly increasing .
&quot; Par@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding has gro@@ wn and ev@@ ol@@ ved no@@ tably .
g@@ ap@@ s between rac@@ ers are becoming small@@ er , and there are a number of new rid@@ ers .
I always think that there is some@@ one new ready to be@@ at me .
every competition seems to have a different w@@ inn@@ er . &quot;
S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i lost one of his leg@@ s in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle accident in 200@@ 9 .
he has always been an en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tic s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der ever since his child@@ ho@@ od and the accident could not keep him off the s@@ lop@@ es .
&quot; every now and then I can &apos;@@ t help but wonder what my life would &apos;@@ ve been like without the accident .
but , I &apos;@@ ve always thought that there &apos;s no going back .
you play the hand you &apos;@@ re dealt , &quot; S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i stres@@ ses .
it would be cru@@ el to say that the serious accident and los@@ ing a le@@ g were a s@@ tro@@ ke of lu@@ ck , and S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i does not .
however , he was able to turn his difficul@@ ty into an advantage .
&quot; I &apos;@@ d say that everything turned for the better .
I W@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be a thre@@ e@@ -@@ time World cha@@ mp@@ ion without the accident . &quot;
before the accident , 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i was los@@ ing interest in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding .
&quot; I really started working to reach the top after the accident .
when I was youn@@ ger , I train@@ ed with my friends , and we were always w@@ at@@ ching the X@@ -@@ G@@ am@@ es .
they were only dis@@ tant dre@@ am@@ s that ne@@ arly di@@ ed as time mo@@ ved on .
after the accident , I some@@ how found myself rac@@ ing at the X@@ -@@ G@@ am@@ es .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have imag@@ ined it .
I was 23 and I thought that this will be a long life if I sta@@ y here feel@@ ing b@@ itte@@ r and feel@@ ing sor@@ ry for myself .
I decided to ro@@ l@@ l up my s@@ le@@ ev@@ es and start working .
I &apos;@@ d say that I &apos;@@ ve succ@@ eeded quite well . &quot;
the rid@@ er was el@@ ated when whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir rac@@ er Le@@ o@@ -@@ Pe@@ k@@ ka T@@ ä@@ h@@ ti was selec@@ ted the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete of the Y@@ e@@ ar in Fin@@ land .
the four@@ -@@ time Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ old med@@ all@@ ist received the a@@ ward at the S@@ ports Gal@@ a held in May .
according to S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i , this recognition is an important signal for par@@ as@@ ports .
&quot; it was huge , and T@@ ä@@ h@@ ti absolutely ear@@ ned it .
this will undoub@@ tedly turn e@@ yes towards par@@ as@@ ports . &quot;
when will be the time to laun@@ ch the campaign for selec@@ ting tw@@ o@@ -@@ time World cha@@ mp@@ ion M@@ at@@ ti S@@ uu@@ r@@ -@@ Ha@@ mar@@ i the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete of the Y@@ e@@ ar ?

S@@ y@@ rian refugees ba@@ king bre@@ ad at a refuge@@ e cam@@ p in J@@ ord@@ an .
the majority of young S@@ y@@ rian refugees do not expect to make a permanent return to their hom@@ el@@ and .
they believe that the S@@ y@@ rian civil war would have to end and I@@ S@@ I@@ S would have to be dri@@ ven out of the country in order for them to return .
the tr@@ um@@ p administration is not expected to bring about a change to the S@@ y@@ rian conflict .

this year &apos;s A V@@ o@@ ice for Y@@ oun@@ g S@@ y@@ rian Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es sur@@ ve@@ y identi@@ fied the opinions and attit@@ ud@@ es of young S@@ y@@ rian refugees living in J@@ ord@@ an and Le@@ ban@@ on .
in February and March 20@@ 17 , a total of 4@@ 00 young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans aged 18@@ -@@ 24 respon@@ ded to the sur@@ ve@@ y . half of these were women and half were men .
half of the inter@@ views were conduc@@ ted in J@@ ord@@ an and half in Le@@ ban@@ on .
according to the sur@@ ve@@ y , more than half of all young S@@ y@@ rian refugees do not expect to make a permanent return to their hom@@ el@@ and .
of all respon@@ d@@ ents , 42 per cent thought that they might return to their hom@@ el@@ and and four per cent did not know whether or not a return is possible .
according to the sur@@ ve@@ y , key factors among young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are the war in S@@ y@@ ria and the presence of I@@ S@@ I@@ S in the country .
ne@@ arly half ( 4@@ 7 per cent ) of all respon@@ d@@ ents thought that the end of the war is the most significant factor affec@@ ting their return home , while one quar@@ ter considered that dri@@ ving I@@ S@@ I@@ S out of the country is the key factor .
less than ten per cent mentioned an improved financial situation or the ex@@ it of Bas@@ ha@@ r al@@ -@@ As@@ sa@@ d from S@@ y@@ ria as the most critical factor .
military actions alone cannot resolve the conflict
young S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans were asked to name the most important factor to end the conflict .
the majority of all respon@@ d@@ ents considered that en@@ ding the war is more important Bas@@ ha@@ r al@@ -@@ As@@ sa@@ d ren@@ oun@@ cing power .
a little more than 25 per cent thought that the presidency of al@@ -@@ As@@ sa@@ d is an obsta@@ cle to a peace treaty .
ne@@ arly half of all respon@@ d@@ ents felt that both political and military solutions are needed to end the on@@ going conflict in S@@ y@@ ria .
only a little more than 25 per cent considered that military action alone can resolve the conflict .
the majority of young S@@ y@@ rian refugees saw that I@@ S@@ I@@ S has lost power over the past year , where@@ as 20 per cent felt that its power has increased .
according to the respon@@ d@@ ents , what is important in the fight against I@@ S@@ I@@ S is that the media would con@@ ve@@ y information to people , saying that I@@ S@@ I@@ S has nothing to do with Isla@@ m .
ne@@ arly as many respon@@ d@@ ents mentioned military actions and an educ@@ ational reform as primary means .
a little more than ten per cent thought that the most important factor would be to create better pa@@ ying jobs for young people .
when asked about the impact of the tr@@ um@@ p administration on the S@@ y@@ rian conflict , 6@@ 6 per cent of all respon@@ d@@ ents said that the conflict will not change during tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s ten@@ ure .
ne@@ arly 25 per cent believ@@ ed that the S@@ y@@ rian conflict will get worse during tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s presidency .

Mon@@ ty W@@ id@@ eni@@ us spen@@ ds half his time cod@@ ing in Ka@@ uni@@ a@@ inen to keep the inter@@ net in perfec@@ t order - his da@@ tab@@ ase is used by W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia and Go@@ og@@ le
Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , a company based in Es@@ po@@ o , is developing &quot; the world &apos;s fas@@ test growing &quot; open source da@@ tab@@ ase .
the main product of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , established by cod@@ er and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el &quot; Mon@@ ty &quot; W@@ id@@ eni@@ us , is free of charge for its users , and it can be developed by any s@@ kill@@ ed program@@ mer through the Internet .
for example , Go@@ og@@ le and W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia use the F@@ inn@@ ish da@@ tab@@ ase , but they may not be any pa@@ ying custom@@ ers .
with da@@ tab@@ ases , huge v@@ olu@@ mes of data can be kept in order and quickly available .
if you use , for example , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ I@@ n , T@@ wit@@ ter or Bo@@ ok@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m , you are using the da@@ tab@@ ase of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B or M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L .
&quot; all information that is not in im@@ age for@@ mat , comes from a da@@ tab@@ ase , and that is where im@@ ages are also linked , &quot; W@@ id@@ eni@@ us says .
W@@ id@@ eni@@ us , who works as the C@@ T@@ O of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B , spen@@ ds half of his time cod@@ ing .
working remo@@ tely from Ka@@ uni@@ a@@ inen , W@@ id@@ eni@@ us makes sure that the Internet works as it should .
W@@ id@@ eni@@ us , together with D@@ avi@@ d A@@ x@@ mark from Sweden , is the develop@@ er of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , the world &apos;s most pop@@ ular open source da@@ tab@@ ase .
in 200@@ 8 , technology company S@@ un b@@ ought M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L at a price of one billion doll@@ ars and , a year later , so@@ f@@ tw@@ are gi@@ ant or@@ ac@@ le acqu@@ ired S@@ un at 7@@ .@@ 4 billion doll@@ ars .
when the or@@ ac@@ le deal lan@@ ded , the majority of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L develop@@ ers announced their intention to leave .
&quot; they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t want to work for or@@ ac@@ le which d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t give a defin@@ ite promis@@ e of the future of M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , &quot; W@@ id@@ eni@@ us says .
at this stage , he had already established a company to develop Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
he did not want to see his life &apos;s work di@@ e .
&quot; I hi@@ red the twenty best develop@@ ers from S@@ un and made sure that the cod@@ e sta@@ ys safe in the hands of the same people who created it in the first place . &quot;
because M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L is an open source da@@ tab@@ ase , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B was able to develop a new b@@ ran@@ ch from it .
only the name had to be changed .
a found@@ ation was set up to super@@ vis@@ e that the cod@@ e of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B can be developed fre@@ ely .
&quot; we d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t use similar safegu@@ ards when developing M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L , &quot; says W@@ id@@ eni@@ us .
even though many have heard of W@@ id@@ eni@@ us and the billion doll@@ ar M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L deal , not many in Fin@@ land know anything about Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
&quot; in recent years , we &apos;@@ ve ground by about 50 per cent a year , &quot; says K@@ enn@@ et@@ h Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n , C@@ F@@ O at Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
at this point , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B foc@@ uses on growth , not on prof@@ it , and Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n has little to say about the company &apos;s key figures .
he does re@@ ve@@ al that Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B ex@@ pects to obtain new orders worth 20 million euro@@ s during this financial period .
because the da@@ tab@@ ase is free of charge , the company has developed au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary services for which cor@@ por@@ ate custom@@ ers are ready to pay .
Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B also help@@ s to exchange da@@ tab@@ ases , which may take more than a year if a custom@@ er has used a closed da@@ tab@@ ase .
a s@@ wit@@ ch from M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L to Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B is quic@@ k and easy , as the two are different ver@@ sions of each other .
for example , T@@ el@@ ef@@ ó@@ n@@ ic@@ a , a Spanish tel@@ ec@@ om oper@@ a@@ tor , and D@@ B@@ S , the larg@@ est ban@@ k in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ sia , are pa@@ ying custom@@ ers of Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B .
the most pop@@ ular cl@@ ou@@ d services , such as A@@ ma@@ z@@ on A@@ W@@ S , M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft Az@@ ure and A@@ li@@ b@@ ab@@ a cl@@ ou@@ d , offer Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B to their custom@@ ers .
at the same time , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B s@@ pre@@ ads autom@@ a@@ tically to new users through L@@ in@@ u@@ x operating system packa@@ ges in which Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B has largely re@@ placed M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L .
even though we are a small company , we are connec@@ ted to major pla@@ yers .
&quot; our custom@@ ers include the world &apos;s larg@@ est tel@@ ec@@ om operators , ga@@ me develop@@ ers , ban@@ ks and even a few central ban@@ ks , &quot; Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n says .
the da@@ tab@@ ase market is still domin@@ ated by gi@@ ants , such as or@@ ac@@ le , M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft , I@@ B@@ M and S@@ A@@ P , with their closed da@@ tab@@ ases .
for or@@ ac@@ le , M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L means a mod@@ est secon@@ d@@ ary business opportunity compared with its traditional closed da@@ tab@@ ase .
even though the larg@@ est da@@ tab@@ ase companies have lost their market shar@@ es according to research company G@@ ar@@ t@@ ner , pla@@ yers such as Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B are small and in@@ significant fir@@ ms , al@@ be@@ it quickly growing ones , measu@@ red by net sal@@ es .
in the da@@ tab@@ ase market of rou@@ gh@@ ly 50 million doll@@ ars , open source da@@ tab@@ ases cannot even reach the th@@ res@@ hold of one billion .
however , the signific@@ ance of open source so@@ f@@ tw@@ are cannot be measu@@ red in money alone , as the majority of users do not pay anything for its use .
G@@ ar@@ t@@ ner estima@@ tes that , in 20@@ 18 , companies will develop more than 70 per cent of their internal appl@@ ications using open source da@@ tab@@ ases .
in addition , more than half of ol@@ der da@@ tab@@ ases will be re@@ placed by open source da@@ tab@@ ases , or at least this trans@@ ition will have been initi@@ ated .
&quot; major cor@@ por@@ ations do not obtain new custom@@ ers , as most users selec@@ t open source so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
this means that the lic@@ ence fe@@ es of commercial da@@ tab@@ ases are s@@ ky high .
companies want to make as much money as they used to do , with fe@@ wer custom@@ ers , &quot; W@@ id@@ eni@@ us says .
because it takes a lot of work to re@@ place a closed da@@ tab@@ ase , most custom@@ er companies have qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly accepted the increased prices .
&quot; we have many custom@@ ers for which it &apos;s really difficult to make this trans@@ ition , because their appl@@ ications and other solutions are ti@@ ed to a closed da@@ tab@@ ase , &quot; says W@@ id@@ eni@@ us .
he still believes that custom@@ ers will soon have had enough .
as lic@@ ence fe@@ es go higher year after year , custom@@ ers will even@@ tually s@@ wit@@ ch to an open source da@@ tab@@ ase .
the price is 10 to 20 per cent of what it was and service is better , as custom@@ ers can easi@@ ly change to another da@@ tab@@ ase .
bes@@ id@@ es , many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their func@@ tions to cl@@ ou@@ d services .
at the same time , many want to change their da@@ tab@@ ase so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
last s@@ pr@@ ing , Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B acqu@@ ired a lo@@ an of 25 million euro@@ s from the European In@@ ves@@ tment Bank ( E@@ I@@ B ) .
this was the larg@@ est growth lo@@ an ever given by the E@@ I@@ B in the Nor@@ di@@ c countries .
the company has 1@@ 15 employees around the world , and it intends to h@@ ire more .
one reason for ob@@ tain@@ ing funding from the E@@ I@@ B was the impact Mar@@ i@@ a@@ D@@ B has on public I@@ T proc@@ ure@@ ment .
the company has public sector custom@@ ers in the UK and Germany , among others .
in Europe , the public sector is pa@@ ying bill@@ ions of euro@@ s a year for da@@ tab@@ ases .
&quot; many countries want to adopt open source solutions and , therefore , use tax re@@ ven@@ ue more effectively , &quot; Pa@@ q@@ val@@ é@@ n says .
W@@ id@@ eni@@ us is not happy about how Fin@@ land is spending money on , say , closed heal@@ th@@ care systems , while open source systems are che@@ aper and do not ti@@ e the c@@ li@@ ent to a single so@@ f@@ tw@@ are company .
some say that open source is an ide@@ ology , but I believe that it is a better way of cod@@ ing .
a community help@@ s and cre@@ ates something you cannot inv@@ ent or do .
al@@ ong@@ side another Fin@@ n , L@@ in@@ us T@@ or@@ val@@ ds , the develop@@ er of L@@ in@@ u@@ x , W@@ id@@ eni@@ us , 55 , is one of the best known contribu@@ tors to open source so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
W@@ id@@ eni@@ us help@@ s other companies to develop func@@ tional business mod@@ els on top of open source .
I still give four to five speec@@ hes on open source in different parts of the world .
Italy tou@@ gh@@ ens t@@ one on NG@@ O mi@@ grant res@@ c@@ ue bo@@ ats
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs operating mi@@ grant res@@ c@@ ue bo@@ ats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules govern@@ ing their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign up to a new cod@@ e of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue operating , &quot; I@@ nte@@ ri@@ or Minister Mar@@ co M@@ inn@@ it@@ i said in an inter@@ view with Tur@@ in daily L@@ a Sta@@ mp@@ a .
M@@ inn@@ it@@ i &apos;s war@@ ning came a day after Italian authorities imp@@ oun@@ ded a bo@@ at oper@@ ated by German aid organis@@ ati@@ ion J@@ ug@@ end R@@ et@@ te@@ t on sus@@ pic@@ ion its cre@@ w effectively coll@@ abor@@ ated with people traffic@@ kers in a way that facilita@@ ted illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been operational for a year , dec@@ lined to comment on the substance of detailed all@@ eg@@ ations made against it by Italian prosecu@@ tor Am@@ bro@@ gi@@ o Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us the res@@ c@@ ue of human life is and will be our top priority , so we are very sor@@ ry we will not be able to operate in the se@@ ar@@ ch and res@@ c@@ ue zone at the moment , &quot; the organisation said in a statement on social media .
&quot; we can only ass@@ ess all the acc@@ us@@ ations currently being made after we have ga@@ ther@@ ed all the information and can ass@@ ess the situation . &quot;
Italian authorities had been monitoring J@@ ug@@ end R@@ et@@ te@@ t &apos;s bo@@ at , the I@@ u@@ ven@@ ta , since October .
its cre@@ w is sus@@ pec@@ ted to taking on board d@@ in@@ gh@@ y lo@@ ads of mi@@ grants deli@@ ver@@ ed directly to them by people traffic@@ kers and allowing the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ l@@ ers to make off with the vessels to be used again .
at least one such meeting all@@ eg@@ ed@@ ly took place only 1.@@ 3 mil@@ es off the Li@@ by@@ an co@@ ast , according to the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s f@@ ile , the con@@ ten@@ ts of which were published by Italian media .
the cre@@ w are sus@@ pec@@ ted of having f@@ lou@@ ted the authority of the Italian coas@@ t@@ gu@@ ard , which over@@ se@@ es res@@ c@@ ue operations in the zone , out of humanitarian z@@ e@@ al rather than for any other mo@@ tives .
under the cod@@ e of conduct , bo@@ ats like the I@@ u@@ ven@@ ta would no@@ tably have to have an Italian police offic@@ er on board monitoring their activities .
only three of the n@@ ine NGOs involved in se@@ ar@@ ch and res@@ c@@ ue operations have so far agreed to ab@@ ide by the cod@@ e : sa@@ ve The Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ren , M@@ alta@@ -@@ based MO@@ A@@ S and Spain &apos;s Pro@@ -@@ Ac@@ ti@@ va O@@ p@@ en Ar@@ ms .
the latter said on Th@@ urs@@ day it regar@@ ded the new rules as un@@ necessary but acceptable as they would not involve any &quot; significant change or im@@ pe@@ d@@ im@@ ent &quot; to its res@@ c@@ ue operations .
among those who have ref@@ used to sign is the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e@@ -@@ w@@ inning organisation D@@ oc@@ tors W@@ i@@ th@@ out B@@ orders ( M@@ S@@ F ) .
M@@ inn@@ it@@ i mean@@ while said a shar@@ p fall over recent weeks in the number of mi@@ grants arri@@ ving in Italy following res@@ cu@@ es was an ind@@ ication that efforts to be@@ ef up the Li@@ by@@ an coas@@ t@@ gu@@ ard and cooperation with local ma@@ y@@ ors was be@@ aring fru@@ it .
&quot; in recent days we have be@@ gu@@ n to see light at the end of the tun@@ nel , &quot; the minis@@ ter said .
he re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed plans for further talks this month with Li@@ by@@ an ma@@ y@@ ors on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Nig@@ er and Mal@@ i on measures to reduce the number of mi@@ grants lea@@ ving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe .

M@@ ic@@ h@@ ell@@ e Car@@ ter sen@@ ten@@ ced for texts urg@@ ing su@@ ic@@ ide of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y
a M@@ assa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts w@@ oman has been sen@@ ten@@ ced to two and a half years for encouraging her bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end to com@@ mit su@@ ic@@ ide through texts and ph@@ one calls .
M@@ ic@@ h@@ ell@@ e Car@@ ter , now 20 , will serve 15 months of her term behind b@@ ars and five years of prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was con@@ vic@@ ted in June of the inv@@ ol@@ un@@ tary man@@ s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , who took his own life on 13 July 20@@ 14 .
Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s fa@@ ther told Th@@ urs@@ day &apos;s hear@@ ing : &quot; my family is hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken .
my son was my best fri@@ end . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free pen@@ ding an appeal .
she had faced a maximum sen@@ tence of 20 years , but her legal te@@ am argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Ro@@ y suffer@@ ed from mental ill@@ ness .
d@@ res@@ sed in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ am b@@ l@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood te@@ ar@@ fully with hands clas@@ p@@ ed and e@@ yes c@@ ast down as she was sen@@ ten@@ ced .
&quot; her actions kill@@ ed Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , &quot; the prosecu@@ tor told the court .
&quot; she en@@ ded his life to better her own .
she has not accepted responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s law@@ yer said it was a &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble circum@@ stan@@ ce that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
however , J@@ ud@@ ge L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence Mon@@ i@@ z said he did not find that her &quot; age or level of ma@@ tur@@ ity or even her mental ill@@ ness have any significant impact on her actions . &quot;
a prosecu@@ tor read a statement from Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s mo@@ ther , L@@ yn@@ n Ro@@ y , saying there was &quot; not one day I do not m@@ our@@ n the los@@ s of my bel@@ o@@ ved son .
I want him to be pro@@ ud of me and how I am hand@@ ling everything - I am trying to be there for his sis@@ ters in all of my pain we will carry with us for e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , &quot; it said .
Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s sis@@ ter , C@@ am@@ d@@ y@@ n Ro@@ y , tes@@ ti@@ fied that she was &quot; ha@@ un@@ ted &quot; by the re@@ alisation that she would never atten@@ d her bro@@ ther &apos;s w@@ ed@@ ding or be an a@@ un@@ t to his children .
&quot; not having that one person I &apos;@@ ve been with every day since b@@ ir@@ th is a pain I &apos;@@ l@@ l always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case appears to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no M@@ assa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts law that crimin@@ alis@@ es tell@@ ing a person to com@@ mit su@@ ic@@ ide .
Car@@ ter was 17 when Mr Ro@@ y was found de@@ ad of car@@ bon mon@@ o@@ x@@ ide pois@@ on@@ ing in a vehic@@ le in 20@@ 14 .
the case dre@@ w national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messa@@ ges re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed she had encoura@@ ged him to end his life .
&quot; han@@ g y@@ our@@ self , j@@ um@@ p off a building , sta@@ b y@@ our@@ self I d@@ on &apos;@@ t know there &apos;s a lot of ways , &quot; she said in several messa@@ ges sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on hol@@ id@@ ay with his family .
in the mom@@ ents before his su@@ ic@@ ide , she w@@ ro@@ te : &quot; you need to do it , Con@@ ra@@ d &quot; and &quot; Al@@ l you have to do is turn the gener@@ a@@ tor on and you will be free and happy . &quot;
jud@@ ge Mon@@ i@@ z said Car@@ ter s@@ ought attention through Mr Ro@@ y &apos;s death , ord@@ ering that she not be allowed to prof@@ it from the case through any press .
the case has divid@@ ed legal opinion .
among the few to defend Car@@ ter was A@@ man@@ da K@@ no@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted of mur@@ der@@ ing her British ro@@ om@@ ma@@ te in Italy in 200@@ 7 before she was cle@@ ared two years ago .
M@@ s K@@ no@@ x , 30 , published an op@@ -@@ ed in the L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es T@@ imes saying : &quot; M@@ ic@@ h@@ ell@@ e Car@@ ter deser@@ ves sym@@ pa@@ thy and help , not pris@@ on . &quot;
NATO Secre@@ tary General : wor@@ st relations with Russia since the C@@ old W@@ ar
J@@ ens S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , NATO Secre@@ tary General , com@@ men@@ ted on Th@@ urs@@ day that relations between NATO and Russia have become signific@@ antly col@@ der .
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g bla@@ med Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukra@@ ine .
&quot; I think it is correct to say that NATO &apos;s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , &quot; S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g told C@@ N@@ N .
&quot; at the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , we hop@@ ed to develop a close partnership with Russia .
but particularly after the illegal anne@@ x@@ ation of C@@ r@@ im@@ e@@ a in 20@@ 14 and the continued Russian des@@ tab@@ il@@ isation of eas@@ tern Ukra@@ ine , the relationship between NATO and Russia has de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated consider@@ ably . &quot;
according to S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , NATO is still committed to avoid@@ ing a further sp@@ ik@@ e in ten@@ sions .
&quot; as long as we are strong , as long as we are pre@@ dic@@ table , we can also eng@@ age in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid es@@ cal@@ ation and avoid a new C@@ old W@@ ar . &quot;
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g &apos;s remarks came as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all@@ -@@ time and very dangerous low .
tr@@ um@@ p bla@@ med the US C@@ ong@@ ress for the poor relationship , as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week .
A@@ ud@@ i to modi@@ fy U@@ p to 8@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 di@@ es@@ el V@@ eh@@ ic@@ les as Car@@ ma@@ kers face bac@@ kl@@ as@@ h
a day before A@@ ud@@ i &apos;s announ@@ cement , B@@ M@@ W said it would offer to up@@ gra@@ de the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are in more than 3@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 vehicles .
the B@@ M@@ W chairman said the company believ@@ ed &quot; there are more intell@@ ig@@ ent op@@ tions than dri@@ ving restrictions , &quot; referring to the European c@@ ities - including M@@ un@@ ich , where B@@ M@@ W is based - that have considered bann@@ ing or restric@@ ting di@@ es@@ el vehicles .
D@@ aim@@ ler announced on Tu@@ es@@ day that it would modi@@ fy three million M@@ er@@ c@@ ed@@ es vehicles in Europe to reduce their di@@ es@@ el emissions .
n@@ one of the companies described the mo@@ ves as rec@@ all@@ s .
European car@@ ma@@ kers have he@@ a@@ vil@@ y promo@@ ted the use of di@@ es@@ el vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on car@@ bon dio@@ x@@ ide emissions .
but the n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen o@@ x@@ id@@ es that di@@ es@@ el eng@@ ines em@@ it are considered car@@ c@@ ino@@ g@@ ens , and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
the cost to autom@@ o@@ tive companies of ins@@ tall@@ ing equipment to neu@@ tr@@ ali@@ z@@ e the fu@@ mes em@@ it@@ ted by di@@ es@@ el vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the c@@ ars competitive .
as German autom@@ ak@@ ers face scru@@ tin@@ y , the government of C@@ han@@ cell@@ or Ang@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ ke@@ l has also been acc@@ used of cod@@ d@@ ling the power@@ ful c@@ ar companies and of ignor@@ ing sig@@ ns of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid repe@@ ating the mis@@ takes of V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en , which covered up its use of so@@ -@@ called de@@ fe@@ at dev@@ ices that could ad@@ just emissions to comply with regulations when a c@@ ar was being tes@@ ted , but e@@ ase back in normal dri@@ ving conditions .
several V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en execu@@ tives have been char@@ ged in the United States , and others are under investig@@ ation on both sides of the A@@ tlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ na@@ m@@ ics at A@@ ud@@ i &apos;s eng@@ ine development de@@ part@@ ment was ar@@ res@@ ted in Germany .
the former manag@@ er , Z@@ acc@@ he@@ o G@@ io@@ v@@ ann@@ i Pa@@ mi@@ o , is Italian , and therefore is not protected from ex@@ tradition and could face trial in the United States .
early this year , A@@ ud@@ i was s@@ w@@ ep@@ t up into a German criminal investig@@ ation involving V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en after the authorities acc@@ used A@@ ud@@ i of ins@@ tall@@ ing a system to e@@ va@@ de emissions rules in Europe , broad@@ ening an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y that had foc@@ used on the United States .
the inclu@@ sion of A@@ ud@@ i in the investig@@ ation could w@@ ei@@ gh he@@ a@@ vil@@ y on V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en : the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y car@@ ma@@ ker accoun@@ ts for a dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate share of V@@ ol@@ ks@@ w@@ ag@@ en &apos;s prof@@ it .
elections in V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a investig@@ ated as ri@@ g@@ ged , lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale prote@@ s@@ ts expected
according to the company , the number of vo@@ ters re@@ ported by V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ an officials is higher than the number of actual vo@@ ters by at least one million .
Ti@@ b@@ is@@ ay L@@ uc@@ en@@ an , cha@@ ir of the national election committee told re@@ por@@ ters that this is an un@@ preced@@ ented opinion from a company which has no role in the election results .
Mad@@ uro states that the crisis will end .
on S@@ und@@ ay , deleg@@ ates were elected in V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a after contro@@ versi@@ al elections to change the constitution .
the opposition has already strongly critic@@ ised the elections and organised prote@@ s@@ ts .
Mad@@ uro &apos;s opposition has post@@ pon@@ ed its prote@@ s@@ ts until the ap@@ poin@@ tments .
according to E@@ l Pa@@ is , national security forces started to take hold of the parlia@@ ment building in W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day evening , local time .
their purpose is to ensure that the ap@@ poin@@ tment event sta@@ ys safe .
Pro@@ v@@ ence la@@ ven@@ der under threat from climate change
it has become a sym@@ bo@@ l of Pro@@ v@@ ence in southern France , but there is a war@@ ning that it &apos;s under threat from climate change .
La@@ ven@@ der is in dec@@ line because of d@@ rou@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ like conditions and dis@@ e@@ ase@@ -@@ car@@ rying ins@@ ec@@ ts , ca@@ using a major head@@ ac@@ he for sci@@ ent@@ ists and farmers attemp@@ ting to find solutions .
E@@ ri@@ c Cha@@ is@@ se , an exper@@ t at the Pro@@ v@@ enc@@ e@@ -@@ based agricultural research institu@@ te C@@ R@@ I@@ E@@ P@@ P@@ A@@ M , said : &quot; La@@ ven@@ der in Pro@@ v@@ ence is effectively end@@ ang@@ ered , because in recent years the pl@@ ant has been sub@@ jec@@ ted to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less ra@@ in in the s@@ pr@@ ing and m@@ os@@ tly in the autu@@ m@@ n .
this affec@@ ts the lif@@ es@@ p@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
there &apos;s also a small c@@ ic@@ ad@@ a , a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ -@@ bac@@ teri@@ a trans@@ mit@@ ting lea@@ f hop@@ per , and in very d@@ ry wea@@ ther there are lo@@ ts of them . &quot;
and a lot is at sta@@ ke .
as well as at@@ trac@@ ting hol@@ id@@ a@@ y@@ ma@@ kers , la@@ ven@@ der oil is highly s@@ ought after for per@@ fu@@ me and cos@@ me@@ tics .
E@@ ri@@ c Cha@@ is@@ se said : &quot; instead of having very long pl@@ ant e@@ ars with a number of large flo@@ w@@ ers , we have small@@ er ones , under@@ developed and either mis@@ sing or wea@@ ken@@ ed .
so we have fe@@ wer parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions being lo@@ ok@@ ed at include better water distribution and s@@ lo@@ wing down e@@ va@@ por@@ ation from the so@@ il , but also sp@@ ra@@ ying the plan@@ ts with a protec@@ tive mi@@ x of cla@@ y and water and developing vari@@ eties more res@@ is@@ tant to d@@ ry conditions .
a jour@@ n@@ alist &apos;s mur@@ der under@@ s@@ co@@ res growing threat in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o
the staff of the wee@@ kly new@@ s@@ paper R@@ io@@ do@@ ce nor@@ m@@ ally meet@@ s on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for cover@@ age of the most recent ma@@ yh@@ e@@ m w@@ rought in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a state by organ@@ iz@@ ed crime , cor@@ rup@@ t officials and c@@ eas@@ eless dru@@ g w@@ ars .
but on this day , in the sha@@ do@@ w of their own traged@@ y , they &apos;@@ ve come together to talk about security .
it &apos;s important to change their rou@@ tin@@ es , they are told .
two sen@@ i@@ or jour@@ n@@ alists discuss what fe@@ els saf@@ er : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a g@@ ren@@ ade attack in 200@@ 9 , or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a bla@@ ck@@ board at the fron@@ t of the room : ad@@ vers@@ aries , neu@@ tr@@ als , all@@ ies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to suggest na@@ mes for each c@@ olu@@ m@@ n - no proof is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and g@@ ut feel@@ ings are enough .
there are dru@@ g@@ -@@ traffic@@ kers , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ people , jour@@ n@@ alists sus@@ pec@@ ted of being on the pay@@ ro@@ l@@ l of the government or the car@@ tel@@ s , a ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ g of vill@@ ain@@ s who make the job of cover@@ ing M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s cha@@ os per@@ il@@ ous .
there is no res@@ pite from the violence , and as bodies p@@ ile up across the country , more and more of them are jour@@ n@@ alists : at least 25 since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to took office in December 20@@ 12 , according to the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists ; 5@@ 8@@ 9 under feder@@ al protection after attacks and thre@@ ats ; and so far this year , at least s@@ even de@@ ad in s@@ even states .
among the latest is their ed@@ itor and ins@@ pi@@ ration , R@@ io@@ do@@ ce co@@ -@@ foun@@ der J@@ avi@@ er Val@@ de@@ z Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest er@@ ro@@ r is to live in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o and to be a jour@@ n@@ alist , &quot; Val@@ de@@ z w@@ ro@@ te in one of his many bo@@ o@@ ks on n@@ ar@@ co@@ -@@ violence .
his abs@@ ence is felt deep@@ ly , although his presence is every@@ where - a large p@@ ho@@ to of Val@@ de@@ z dis@@ playing his m@@ iddle fin@@ ger , with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; han@@ gs on the fac@@ ade of the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce building ; two re@@ por@@ ters on their 3@@ 0@@ s , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am R@@ a@@ mi@@ re@@ z , we@@ ar T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts that dis@@ play his s@@ mil@@ ing , bes@@ pec@@ ta@@ cl@@ ed face or his tra@@ dem@@ ar@@ k P@@ an@@ am@@ a h@@ at .
the wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p takes place less than two months after his death ; the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared tra@@ u@@ ma , their ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ an@@ o@@ ia .
although a special feder@@ al prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to han@@ dle the jour@@ n@@ alists &apos; cases , it has only prosecu@@ ted two , according to the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders ti@@ ed to dru@@ g trafficking and organ@@ iz@@ ed crime each year , the kill@@ ers of jour@@ n@@ alists are r@@ ar@@ ely brought to justice .
at R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , they per@@ sis@@ t in cover@@ ing the violence of S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , though they are hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken , though the ter@@ ra@@ in is more tre@@ ac@@ her@@ ous now .
without information on the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
&quot; it &apos;s very fo@@ ol@@ ish to waste my time in this wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we d@@ on &apos;@@ t know why , you dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ de@@ z left the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to dri@@ ve just a cou@@ ple b@@ loc@@ ks before his red T@@ o@@ yo@@ ta Co@@ ro@@ lla was sto@@ pped by two men ; he was forced out of his c@@ ar and sho@@ t 12 times , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly for the name of the paper - which trans@@ la@@ tes as t@@ wel@@ f@@ th R@@ iv@@ er .
the g@@ un@@ man dro@@ ve away in his c@@ ar and cr@@ as@@ hed it ne@@ ar@@ by .
Val@@ de@@ z was 50 years old .
he left a wi@@ f@@ e and two ad@@ ult children .
Ru@@ mor@@ s ten@@ d to f@@ ly fre@@ ely in C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z , there &apos;s practic@@ ally nothing but sil@@ ence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s ar@@ rest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , S@@ in@@ alo@@ a has been one of the country &apos;s b@@ loo@@ di@@ est b@@ att@@ leg@@ ro@@ unds as ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight to f@@ ill the va@@ c@@ uu@@ m .
never mind that some@@ one or several people are sho@@ t de@@ ad in the stre@@ et every day in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , or that the c@@ em@@ e@@ ter@@ y is fill@@ ed with or@@ n@@ ate , tw@@ o@@ -@@ s@@ tory ma@@ us@@ ole@@ u@@ ms for dru@@ g k@@ ings , larg@@ er than many hom@@ es for the living .
forget for a minu@@ te that a state of &quot; cal@@ m &quot; is when just one car@@ te@@ l is in control of the coas@@ tal state with its valuable ports and dru@@ g@@ -@@ trafficking rou@@ tes to the United States .
despite that , and the fact that Val@@ de@@ z was inti@@ ma@@ tely aware of the per@@ ils of his work , Is@@ ma@@ il Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z , 60 , a co@@ -@@ foun@@ der and direc@@ tor of R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , is w@@ rac@@ ked with gu@@ il@@ t for fail@@ ing to protect his fri@@ end .
he believes two er@@ ro@@ rs contribu@@ ted to the kill@@ ing .
first there was the pub@@ l@@ ication in February of an inter@@ view with D@@ am@@ as@@ o L@@ ope@@ z , a lead@@ er of one of the ri@@ val car@@ te@@ l fac@@ tions at war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s s@@ ons .
the pi@@ ece may have ang@@ ered the s@@ ons ; sus@@ pec@@ ted gan@@ g members b@@ ought up every c@@ op@@ y of the ed@@ ition as soon as they were deli@@ ver@@ ed to new@@ s@@ stands .
the second mis@@ take was not for@@ cing Val@@ de@@ z to leave the country for his own safety after the se@@ iz@@ ure of another new@@ s@@ paper that carried the same s@@ tory .
Val@@ de@@ z was a leg@@ end in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o and ab@@ road , and his kill@@ ing is seen as a mil@@ es@@ t@@ one in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an violence against jour@@ n@@ alists .
he &apos;@@ d sur@@ vi@@ ved for so long , his friends and colleagues as@@ sum@@ ed he &apos;@@ d always be there .
he was a ve@@ ter@@ an re@@ por@@ ter for N@@ o@@ ro@@ es@@ te in 2003 when he join@@ ed five colleagues in creating R@@ io@@ do@@ ce , sell@@ ing $ 50 shar@@ es .
in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to do jour@@ n@@ alism without tou@@ ching the n@@ ar@@ co issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z .
over time the paper ear@@ ned a re@@ pu@@ tation for b@@ ra@@ ve and hon@@ est cover@@ age , and sal@@ es and adver@@ tis@@ ing increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters lo@@ ved being able to publis@@ h har@@ d@@ -@@ h@@ it@@ ting investig@@ ations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and read@@ ers were fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated by a pub@@ l@@ ication where they could read stor@@ ies no@@ body else d@@ ared to cover .
eight years after R@@ io@@ do@@ ce was foun@@ ded , it w@@ on the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous Mar@@ ia Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot a@@ ward for cover@@ age in Latin America .
that same year , Val@@ de@@ z w@@ on the International P@@ ress Freed@@ om A@@ ward of the Committee to protect J@@ our@@ n@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ ing the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an dru@@ g s@@ tory wh@@ er@@ ever it led .
he fre@@ ely acknowled@@ ged that he was fri@@ gh@@ tened .
&quot; I want to carry on living , &quot; he said at the time of the C@@ P@@ J a@@ ward .
dru@@ g trafficking in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October , in an inter@@ view with R@@ om@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to T@@ V .
&quot; you have to assume the task that fall@@ s to you as a jour@@ n@@ alist - either that or you play d@@ um@@ b .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to be asked , &apos; Wh@@ at were you doing in the face of so much death ... why d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t you say what was going on ? &apos; &quot;
the R@@ io@@ do@@ ce staff mis@@ ses Val@@ de@@ z , the jo@@ kes@@ ter who s@@ wor@@ e like a l@@ ong@@ sho@@ re@@ man , the fri@@ end gener@@ ous with hu@@ gs and advice , a te@@ ac@@ her who k@@ new how to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
they reli@@ ed on his rou@@ tin@@ e .
he would always we@@ ar his h@@ at .
he would go to E@@ l Gu@@ a@@ y@@ ab@@ o , the b@@ ar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
now , they ask : was his lo@@ ve of rou@@ tin@@ e his do@@ w@@ n@@ fall ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how best to do their jobs and sta@@ y ali@@ ve .
&quot; they d@@ on &apos;@@ t like it if you m@@ ess with their women , their children , their cle@@ an businesses , their cl@@ an@@ des@@ tin@@ e air@@ s@@ tri@@ ps &quot; used to move drugs .
&quot; those things were off@@ -@@ limits , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z .
the result is , even in the best of times , a hi@@ gh@@ -@@ level of sel@@ f@@ -@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and sel@@ f@@ -@@ preser@@ vation .
tr@@ us@@ ting one &apos;s ins@@ t@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ell@@ s wrong , sta@@ y away .
the tro@@ u@@ ble , said R@@ io@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itor An@@ d@@ res V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real , is that &quot; sm@@ el@@ l is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing with J@@ avi@@ er happened . &quot;
the old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a - just as they d@@ on &apos;@@ t in T@@ a@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ er@@ r@@ ero and other states that are home to a to@@ x@@ ic mi@@ x of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling rou@@ tes , wea@@ k institutions and cor@@ rup@@ t government officials .
the lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e constantly shi@@ f@@ ts .
in the room where R@@ io@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly no cell@@ p@@ hon@@ es were allowed ; days before , it was re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that sp@@ y@@ w@@ are sol@@ d exclu@@ sively to governments had been used to monitor jour@@ n@@ alists and acti@@ vis@@ ts in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
outside , two police offic@@ ers s@@ ought reli@@ ef from the 1@@ 04@@ -@@ degree ( 40 C@@ el@@ si@@ us ) he@@ at in the sha@@ de of a tre@@ e .
they were as@@ signed by the state government to gu@@ ard R@@ io@@ do@@ ce &apos;s offic@@ es , hou@@ sed in a four@@ -@@ s@@ tory building in a mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
H@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ jo@@ k@@ ingly , some of the re@@ por@@ ters won@@ der@@ ed whether these offic@@ ers are among the 50 perc@@ ent of CO@@ Ps whom the govern@@ or him@@ self has said are not tr@@ us@@ t@@ wor@@ thy .
it has been months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the moun@@ tain@@ ous coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , where the dru@@ g gan@@ gs are in de fac@@ to control .
for this week &apos;s ed@@ ition R@@ io@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stor@@ ies .
there was the kill@@ ing of former bo@@ x@@ ing great Ju@@ li@@ o C@@ es@@ ar Cha@@ ve@@ z &apos;s bro@@ ther in S@@ in@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pose on government spending concent@@ rated in the govern@@ or &apos;s hom@@ et@@ own .
and there was a group kid@@ na@@ pp@@ ing in one of C@@ u@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expen@@ sive res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ants , a blo@@ ck from the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office .
there was no official word on who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so cau@@ tion set in when it came time to wr@@ ite what everyone in the c@@ ity knows : that the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant is a fav@@ or@@ ite of both dru@@ g traffic@@ kers and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ter lear@@ ned from public rec@@ or@@ ds that the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant was regis@@ tered under the name of a politic@@ ian bel@@ ong@@ ing to the r@@ ul@@ ing In@@ stitu@@ tional R@@ ev@@ olution Party , or P@@ R@@ I , which domin@@ ated all levels of politics for ne@@ arly all of the last century .
recently several P@@ R@@ I govern@@ ors have been acc@@ used of cor@@ ruption in hi@@ gh@@ -@@ prof@@ ile cases .
V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to wr@@ ite about pri@@ or inc@@ idents in that loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; E@@ l C@@ hap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man es@@ cap@@ ed a military ra@@ id .
just months before , read@@ ers would have lo@@ ok@@ ed to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s c@@ olu@@ m@@ n for the bes@@ t@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ ced information about the kid@@ na@@ pp@@ ing .
&quot; before , we would have already known what happened , &quot; said V@@ ill@@ ar@@ real , 4@@ 6 , n@@ ic@@ k@@ na@@ med &quot; E@@ l F@@ la@@ co &quot; for his s@@ l@@ ender build .
&quot; now all ch@@ ann@@ els of communication with our sources have been bro@@ ken . &quot;
Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a stor@@ age room for sig@@ ns and s@@ tic@@ kers prote@@ s@@ ting jour@@ n@@ alist kill@@ ings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : acti@@ vis@@ ts on behalf of the press .
re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am R@@ a@@ mi@@ re@@ z gra@@ b@@ bed a few of the sig@@ ns and head@@ ed out the next morning for a demonstra@@ tion at the local prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office over yet another jour@@ n@@ alist .
S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or A@@ da@@ me dis@@ appe@@ ared in the w@@ estern state of M@@ ic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after Val@@ de@@ z was kill@@ ed .
a bur@@ ned body has been dis@@ covered and officials say it is his , based on D@@ N@@ A tes@@ ts .
nation@@ wide , jour@@ n@@ alists have become more vo@@ cal , sc@@ ra@@ w@@ ling &quot; S@@ O@@ S P@@ ress &quot; on si@@ de@@ w@@ al@@ ks and buil@@ dings in organ@@ iz@@ ed prote@@ s@@ ts .
on this day , the direc@@ tor Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z is away in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , trying to r@@ ally international support for justice in the Val@@ de@@ z case .
at a meeting with the govern@@ or of S@@ in@@ alo@@ a the day after Val@@ de@@ z was kill@@ ed , R@@ a@@ mi@@ re@@ z acc@@ used authorities of sp@@ ying on jour@@ n@@ alists and having them kill@@ ed for tell@@ ing the truth .
she has since asked to be reas@@ signed from cover@@ ing the government , concerned that her ang@@ er has h@@ ur@@ t her objec@@ ti@@ vity .
Val@@ de@@ z had repe@@ a@@ tedly said that jour@@ n@@ alists in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o are &quot; sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed &quot; by organ@@ iz@@ ed crime , compl@@ ic@@ it government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last bo@@ ok , &quot; N@@ ar@@ co@@ -@@ jour@@ n@@ alism , &quot; he w@@ ro@@ te that re@@ por@@ ters are being kill@@ ed not just by dru@@ g gan@@ gs but on the order of politicians and security forces in ca@@ ho@@ o@@ ts with organ@@ iz@@ ed crime .
the media w@@ at@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 at@@ tribu@@ ted more than half of attacks on jour@@ n@@ alists last year to police and public officials .
&quot; in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o you di@@ e because they want to sh@@ ut you up , &quot; R@@ a@@ mi@@ re@@ z said .
clearly , the mur@@ ders have a ch@@ ill@@ ing effect .
no one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blo@@ gg@@ er Mar@@ ia E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h Mac@@ i@@ as in the nor@@ thern border state of T@@ a@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ p@@ as .
her body was found along with a note pur@@ porte@@ dly signed by the Z@@ e@@ tas car@@ te@@ l : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a com@@ pu@@ ter ke@@ y@@ board and head@@ p@@ hon@@ es la@@ y next to her sever@@ ed head .
some out@@ l@@ ets have op@@ ted to close , such as the new@@ s@@ paper E@@ l Nor@@ te , in the nor@@ thern border state of Ch@@ ih@@ u@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the kill@@ ing of cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ent Mi@@ ros@@ la@@ va b@@ reach in March .
others keep going , as E@@ l Man@@ ana of N@@ u@@ ev@@ o L@@ ar@@ ed@@ o did following the kill@@ ing of its direc@@ tor in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ar@@ io de C@@ i@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ ar@@ e@@ z addressed the dru@@ g car@@ tel@@ s pub@@ lic@@ ly with a fron@@ t@@ -@@ pa@@ ge ed@@ itor@@ ial tit@@ led , &quot; Wh@@ at do you want from us ? &quot;
some jour@@ n@@ alists have f@@ led their home states or even the country .
it &apos;s a w@@ ren@@ ching decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still s@@ can the stre@@ ets , looking for danger .
and sometimes , they are hun@@ ted down , as appar@@ ently was p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ her Ru@@ b@@ en E@@ sp@@ in@@ os@@ a , who was mur@@ der@@ ed in 20@@ 15 along with four women in a M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity a@@ part@@ ment three months after fle@@ eing Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who sta@@ y behind and continue the work , it &apos;s a daily d@@ ance of hi@@ gh@@ -@@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra - who once wanted to be a po@@ et - ad@@ m@@ its that cover@@ ing the dru@@ g trade sc@@ ar@@ es him .
&quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o is going to hel@@ l , and that &apos;s why I bec@@ a@@ me a re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at mid@@ night on a recent F@@ rid@@ ay , with the latest issue already put to bed , R@@ io@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors s@@ at on the si@@ de@@ w@@ al@@ k outside the office , d@@ rin@@ king be@@ er , when all at once , their p@@ hon@@ es beg@@ an to bu@@ z@@ z .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ou@@ ts involving gan@@ g ri@@ val@@ s and security forces ne@@ ar the be@@ ach res@@ or@@ t c@@ ity of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ an had left 19 confirmed de@@ ad .
the war continued to es@@ cal@@ ate , as was promis@@ ed by a series of car@@ te@@ l messa@@ ges dis@@ covered in the area .
from the cur@@ b , via cell@@ ph@@ one , they put the ne@@ ws up on R@@ io@@ do@@ ce &apos;s we@@ b@@ sit@@ e .
the fron@@ t pa@@ ge would have to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens wa@@ iled ne@@ ar@@ by - another sho@@ ot@@ out in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z g@@ lan@@ ced over at the police offic@@ ers standing gu@@ ard to see if they were al@@ er@@ t .
if they were at all af@@ ra@@ id , they d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t show it .
bene@@ ath the mas@@ sive por@@ tra@@ it of their new@@ s@@ paper &apos;s fall@@ en foun@@ der , his m@@ iddle fin@@ ger dis@@ played for all of S@@ in@@ alo@@ a to see , the staff of R@@ io@@ do@@ ce was following in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can you even think of clos@@ ing , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ e@@ z said , &quot; when the same day J@@ avi@@ er was kill@@ ed the inter@@ n asked me to send her out to report on the stre@@ et ? &quot;
H@@ ann@@ u M@@ ann@@ inen &apos;s Ol@@ ymp@@ ic project star@@ ts with a huge set@@ back - &quot; I@@ t &apos;s tou@@ gh &quot;
H@@ ann@@ u M@@ ann@@ inen turned 39 in April , but did not cel@@ eb@@ rate long , as the professional pil@@ ot started to prepare for the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic se@@ as@@ on .
however , the training period had a ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ hi@@ c start when M@@ ann@@ inen cau@@ ght the f@@ l@@ u .
this turned into a long period of ill@@ n@@ esses , stre@@ t@@ ching to five weeks .
in practice , M@@ ann@@ inen was ill throughout May .
&quot; first I had the f@@ l@@ u and finally an e@@ ar inf@@ ec@@ tion , for which I had to take anti@@ bio@@ tics .
I was able to complete some ten per cent of the planned training s@@ es@@ sions .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t remember the last time I was that si@@ ck .
it was tou@@ gh - I was hun@@ g@@ ry for training , but I just w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t able to do anything , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says to I@@ l@@ ta@@ -@@ S@@ anom@@ at .
test results came down
the g@@ old med@@ all@@ ist in 200@@ 7 World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships was only allowed to tra@@ in during the second week of June . this was reflec@@ ted in the results of the t@@ read@@ m@@ ill test conduc@@ ted by K@@ I@@ H@@ U - the Research In@@ stitu@@ te for Ol@@ ymp@@ ic S@@ ports - on 12 June .
in the test , an a@@ th@@ l@@ ete uses ro@@ ll@@ er s@@ k@@ is to s@@ ki on a t@@ read@@ m@@ ill , the speed of which increas@@ es every three minu@@ tes .
after every thre@@ e@@ -@@ minu@@ te period , the t@@ read@@ m@@ ill is sto@@ pped for ten secon@@ ds , and the tes@@ ter takes a sa@@ mp@@ le of la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id from the a@@ th@@ l@@ ete &apos;s fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p .
&quot; last autu@@ m@@ n , I was able to keep going for 32 minu@@ tes , but now I had to stop after 28 minu@@ tes .
I h@@ it the w@@ all , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says .
heading in a better direction
after initial difficulties , M@@ ann@@ inen says that he has sta@@ yed heal@@ thy .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve carried out s@@ low a@@ er@@ ob@@ ic exerc@@ ises to return my me@@ tab@@ ol@@ ism back to normal .
the last five weeks have been really good .
during M@@ id@@ sum@@ mer , I also had a break of a week and a half from f@@ lying .
I was able to spen@@ d some time with my family at our hol@@ id@@ ay home . &quot;
last se@@ as@@ on , M@@ ann@@ inen only rac@@ ed in four World C@@ up compet@@ itions before the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in La@@ h@@ ti .
M@@ ann@@ inen reached his best position in the opening competition when he cl@@ im@@ b@@ ed up to 18@@ th place after an excellent s@@ ki@@ ing per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
goals have been set
M@@ ann@@ inen and P@@ et@@ ter K@@ u@@ k@@ k@@ on@@ en , head co@@ ach of the national te@@ am , have prepared a training and rac@@ ing plan up to February .
&quot; we are looking for a different training r@@ hy@@ th@@ m compared with last se@@ as@@ on .
the se@@ as@@ on open@@ er is followed by a wee@@ ken@@ d of three World C@@ up star@@ ts in Ru@@ ka .
in December , the plan is to take part in at least one World C@@ up wee@@ ken@@ d , possibly in R@@ am@@ sa@@ u .
then , the plan is to ra@@ ce in Se@@ ef@@ el@@ d at the end of January .
after that , I hope that my name is on the list of the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic te@@ am , &quot; M@@ ann@@ inen says .
the Ol@@ ymp@@ ics in P@@ ye@@ ong@@ C@@ han@@ g would be the si@@ x@@ th W@@ in@@ ter G@@ am@@ es for M@@ ann@@ inen .
&quot; the important thing is to sta@@ y heal@@ thy , &quot; emphas@@ ises N@@ um@@ mel@@ a@@ -@@ based M@@ ann@@ inen who w@@ on the g@@ old med@@ al in the te@@ am event in S@@ al@@ t La@@ ke C@@ ity in 2002 .
d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to e@@ va@@ de its enem@@ ies
at first g@@ l@@ ance , it loo@@ ks like a sta@@ tu@@ e al@@ be@@ it a terri@@ fying one .
now res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers have re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed the first fin@@ dings from the inc@@ redi@@ ble r@@ h@@ ino@@ -@@ sized cre@@ a@@ ture found by a Can@@ ad@@ ian min@@ er were so well preser@@ ved experts have described it as &apos; the Mon@@ a L@@ isa of d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs &apos; .
it was so well preser@@ ved , they were even able to determin@@ e the col@@ our of its sc@@ al@@ y s@@ kin was a re@@ d@@ dis@@ h bro@@ wn - and say it had something of a &apos; tro@@ ub@@ led past &apos; .
the report in the jour@@ nal C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent B@@ i@@ ology described it as &apos; the bes@@ t@@ -@@ preser@@ ved ar@@ mo@@ red d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r ever found , and one of the best d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens in the world . &apos;
the fos@@ si@@ l is a new@@ found spec@@ ies of no@@ d@@ os@@ au@@ r , which li@@ ved mid@@ way through the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous period , between 1@@ 10 million and 1@@ 12 million years ago .

the arm@@ ou@@ red plan@@ t@@ -@@ e@@ a@@ ter is the best preser@@ ved fos@@ si@@ l of its kind ever found , according to reports in N@@ ational geogra@@ p@@ hi@@ c .
it was found by S@@ ha@@ wn f@@ un@@ k , when he was di@@ gg@@ ing at the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ ill@@ eni@@ um M@@ ine ne@@ ar For@@ t Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y in nor@@ thern Al@@ ber@@ ta , Can@@ ad@@ a , on March 21 , 20@@ 11 .
he h@@ it something which seem@@ ed out of place from the sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing ro@@ ck , and decided to take a closer look .
the fos@@ si@@ l he un@@ covered was sent to the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ l@@ l M@@ use@@ um of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
they spent the next six years working on un@@ cover@@ ing the be@@ ast within the 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00@@ -@@ p@@ ound ( 1@@ ,@@ 100 k@@ g ) lu@@ m@@ p of ear@@ th .
after all that hard work , the fin@@ ished result is now ready to be un@@ ve@@ iled .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you just s@@ qu@@ in@@ t your e@@ yes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ le@@ eping , &apos; said lead auth@@ or C@@ al@@ e@@ b Bro@@ wn , a sci@@ ent@@ ist at the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ l@@ l M@@ use@@ um where the cre@@ a@@ ture is on dis@@ play .
&apos;@@ I@@ t will go down in science history as one of the most be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful and best preser@@ ved d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens - the Mon@@ a L@@ isa of d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs . &apos;
by stud@@ ying its s@@ kin , res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers found that this plan@@ t@@ -@@ e@@ a@@ ter , though covered in arm@@ or and res@@ emb@@ ling a w@@ al@@ king tan@@ k , likely faced a significant threat from me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs .
the he@@ a@@ vil@@ y arm@@ ou@@ red d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r used red and wh@@ ite cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge to h@@ ide from pre@@ d@@ ators , and employed a shi@@ el@@ ding tech@@ ni@@ que known as coun@@ ter@@ -@@ sha@@ ding , which is also used by many modern@@ -@@ day animals .
this would have allowed it to better b@@ l@@ end into its sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings and e@@ va@@ de its enem@@ ies , experts say , sugges@@ ting it was pre@@ yed on by larg@@ er d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs .
the 11@@ 0@@ -@@ mill@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old cre@@ a@@ ture , part of the no@@ d@@ os@@ au@@ r family , first h@@ it head@@ lines in May and is now on view at the Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ yr@@ re@@ l@@ l M@@ use@@ um of P@@ ala@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology .
res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers have now stu@@ di@@ ed and na@@ med the be@@ ast B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mar@@ k@@ mit@@ ch@@ ell@@ i after m@@ use@@ um techn@@ ic@@ ian Mar@@ k M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l , one of a te@@ am who spent more than 7@@ ,@@ 000 hours pa@@ ins@@ tak@@ ingly un@@ cover@@ ing it .
the a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing preser@@ vation of the spec@@ im@@ en made it possible for D@@ r M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l and an international te@@ am of sci@@ ent@@ ists to document the pat@@ tern and sha@@ pe of sc@@ al@@ es and arm@@ our across its body .
they dis@@ covered coun@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding , a common method of defence in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , which means the top of the cre@@ a@@ ture was d@@ ar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although coun@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding is common , the fin@@ dings come as surpris@@ e because B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta &apos;s siz@@ e far exc@@ eed@@ s that of coun@@ ter@@ sha@@ ded animals ali@@ ve today .
it sugges@@ ts the d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs that ev@@ olution fav@@ ou@@ red conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment over conf@@ ron@@ tation as a means of sur@@ vi@@ val .
but most con@@ temporary animals that have coun@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding -@@ - think de@@ er , z@@ eb@@ ra@@ s or ar@@ ma@@ d@@ ill@@ os -@@ - are much small@@ er and more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able as pre@@ y , sig@@ n@@ al@@ ing that this no@@ d@@ os@@ au@@ r faced a real str@@ u@@ gg@@ le to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
&apos;@@ S@@ tr@@ ong pre@@ d@@ ation on a mas@@ sive , he@@ a@@ vil@@ y@@ -@@ ar@@ mo@@ red d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r ill@@ ustra@@ tes just how dangerous the d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r pre@@ d@@ ators of the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous must have been , &apos; said Bro@@ wn .
chem@@ ical analysis of organ@@ ic comp@@ oun@@ ds in its sc@@ al@@ es also re@@ ve@@ al that the d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s s@@ kin would have been re@@ d@@ dis@@ h bro@@ wn .
sci@@ ent@@ ists are continuing to study the animal for c@@ lu@@ es about its life , including its preser@@ ved g@@ ut con@@ ten@@ ts to find out what it ate for its last me@@ al .
they believe that when the d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r di@@ ed , it fel@@ l into a ri@@ ver and was s@@ w@@ ep@@ t out to sea , where it san@@ k on its back to the oc@@ ean floor .
at that time , Al@@ ber@@ ta was as war@@ m as s@@ outh F@@ lor@@ ida is today , and ri@@ vers and oc@@ e@@ ans likely s@@ pread far further in@@ land than they do now .
&apos;@@ T@@ his no@@ d@@ os@@ au@@ r is truly remar@@ ka@@ ble in that it is completely covered in preser@@ ved sc@@ al@@ y s@@ kin , yet is also preser@@ ved in three d@@ im@@ ensi@@ ons , re@@ tain@@ ing the original sha@@ pe of the animal , &apos; said Bro@@ wn .
&apos;@@ The result is that the animal loo@@ ks almost the same today as it did back in the E@@ arly C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous .
you d@@ on &apos;@@ t need to use much imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it ; if you just s@@ qu@@ in@@ t your e@@ yes a bit , you could almost believe it was s@@ le@@ eping . &apos;
the C@@ re@@ tac@@ e@@ ous was a time when gi@@ ant ther@@ op@@ ods , me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ating d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ urs that stood on two leg@@ s , ro@@ am@@ ed the E@@ ar@@ th .
although the king of them all , T@@ yr@@ ann@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , li@@ ved millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ ou@@ red d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r may have been hun@@ ted by some of its form@@ id@@ able an@@ c@@ es@@ tors .
they include A@@ cro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ us , a 3@@ 8@@ ft ( 11@@ .@@ 5@@ m ) long mon@@ s@@ ter w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ing six tonn@@ es .
the sci@@ ent@@ ists , whose latest fin@@ dings appear in the jour@@ nal C@@ ur@@ r@@ ent B@@ i@@ ology , believe B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was w@@ as@@ hed out to sea after it di@@ ed and mu@@ m@@ mi@@ fied in mu@@ d .

I can coun@@ t the sc@@ al@@ es on its s@@ ole . &apos;
how one acti@@ vis@@ t came to learn the answer to the question : &apos; whose stre@@ ets ? &apos;
on A@@ ug@@ . 9 , 20@@ 14 , Brit@@ tan@@ y Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l was sha@@ ken to her cor@@ e .
just a day after arri@@ ving in New Yor@@ k C@@ ity on a tri@@ p , the S@@ t@@ . L@@ ou@@ is na@@ tive s@@ at on the bed of an A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b she was r@@ enting , sc@@ ro@@ ll@@ ing through F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok on her ph@@ one .
she stu@@ m@@ b@@ led upon a post from some@@ one from high scho@@ ol .
&quot; the police just kill@@ ed an 18 year old ki@@ d and he &apos;s still la@@ ying in the stre@@ et , &quot; it read .
conf@@ used , no@@ tic@@ ing no one else on her feed had pos@@ ted the information , she closed F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok and open@@ ed T@@ wit@@ ter .
a us@@ er with the han@@ dle @ T@@ he@@ e@@ P@@ har@@ o@@ a@@ h was being constantly re@@ tw@@ e@@ e@@ ted on@@ to her ti@@ m@@ elin@@ e .
the S@@ t@@ . L@@ ou@@ is@@ -@@ area rap@@ per was li@@ ve@@ -@@ tw@@ e@@ et@@ ing the death of M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el Bro@@ wn , an un@@ arm@@ ed b@@ lack 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old kill@@ ed by a wh@@ ite police offic@@ er in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , M@@ o .
he pos@@ ted a pic@@ ture of Bro@@ wn &apos;s lif@@ eless body stre@@ t@@ ched out in the stre@@ et , where it would sta@@ y for four hours .
&quot; this is w@@ il@@ d , &quot; Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l thought to her@@ self .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put down her ph@@ one only to return later that evening to tw@@ e@@ ets about people ga@@ ther@@ ing on Can@@ field dri@@ ve .
there were p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of police ta@@ pe and people y@@ elling , and of a gu@@ y claim@@ ing to be Bro@@ wn &apos;s fa@@ ther holding a sign that read , &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police just kill@@ ed my un@@ arm@@ ed son ! &quot;
she w@@ at@@ ched a live feed where a police offic@@ er stood in fron@@ t of a group of prote@@ s@@ ters with a bar@@ king do@@ g .
in another v@@ ide@@ o , a different co@@ p , she said , co@@ c@@ ked his ri@@ f@@ le and s@@ cre@@ am@@ ed , &quot; I &apos;@@ l@@ l k@@ ill all you ... animals . &quot;
&quot; &apos; this is not us@@ ual , &apos; &quot; Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l rec@@ all@@ ed saying .
&quot; &apos; this is@@ n &apos;@@ t the type of mur@@ der that we &apos;@@ ve become used to and can call typ@@ ical . &apos;
in that moment I felt ch@@ ill@@ s .
I was ang@@ ry and cr@@ ying . &quot;
she bo@@ ok@@ ed a return f@@ light and w@@ ent home the next day .
after lan@@ ding at 11 p.m. , she pic@@ ked up her 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter from her d@@ ad &apos;s house and decided the two of them would head to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened , to Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l and to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on in the following almost three years is the subject of a new docu@@ mentary , &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the@@ a@@ ters A@@ ug@@ . 11 .
it &apos;s a ta@@ le of sur@@ vi@@ val and prote@@ st , lo@@ ve and los@@ s , streng@@ th and res@@ ili@@ ence from the van@@ ta@@ ge point of the people who live in the community and pac@@ ked the stre@@ ets deman@@ ding answ@@ ers .
as Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l dro@@ ve to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on with her d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter , who was we@@ aring a f@@ lor@@ al d@@ ress and mat@@ ching cro@@ wn , the two re@@ visi@@ ted a conver@@ sa@@ tion they &apos;@@ d had coun@@ t@@ less times before that morning &quot; about the b@@ lack experience and b@@ lack condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I tau@@ ght you about when b@@ lack people had to fight for what they believ@@ ed in ? &quot; she rec@@ all@@ ed saying .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on right now because the police kill@@ ed an 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y and it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t right .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t not take her , &quot; Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l said later .
&quot; this happening today is a cul@@ min@@ ation of ... that has happened in the past .
she needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
she needs to be well developed in the area of not just acti@@ vis@@ m and organ@@ iz@@ ing but know@@ ing the different la@@ yers of the b@@ lack experience and the b@@ lack condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;@@ m for@@ tun@@ ate enough to provide her an experience where she do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t personally experience bla@@ tant racism , she is no different than the next b@@ lack w@@ om@@ an@@ -@@ child .
I feel like I would be doing her a dis@@ service to shi@@ el@@ d her from that . &quot;
the first stop when they arri@@ ved in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on was on South F@@ lor@@ is@@ san@@ t Ro@@ ad , a sit@@ e across from the police de@@ part@@ ment that bec@@ a@@ me a c@@ amp@@ ground of sor@@ ts as the acti@@ vis@@ ts a@@ wa@@ ited word of O@@ ffic@@ er D@@ ar@@ ren W@@ il@@ son &apos;s even@@ tual n@@ on@@ -@@ indic@@ tment .
there Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l and her d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter linked up with a local business ow@@ ner who was making sa@@ ck l@@ un@@ ches .
they prepared b@@ ag@@ s and help@@ ed pass them out to prote@@ s@@ ters .
s@@ low@@ ly , a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m beg@@ an to take sha@@ pe for Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m completely trans@@ for@@ med after A@@ ug@@ . 9 , &quot; she said , no@@ ting that while an under@@ gra@@ d at the Uni@@ versity of M@@ is@@ sou@@ ri@@ -@@ S@@ t . L@@ ou@@ is , she was presid@@ ent of the Min@@ ority stud@@ ent n@@ ur@@ ses A@@ ss@@ n@@ . and foc@@ used on food justice and health dis@@ par@@ ities in b@@ lack communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organ@@ iz@@ ing .
it all just came . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l met S@@ ab@@ a@@ a@@ h F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an , one of the fil@@ m &apos;s co@@ -@@ direc@@ tors , during an evening demonstra@@ tion .
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an said she and her direc@@ tor of p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y L@@ uc@@ as Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o@@ -@@ F@@ ar@@ ra@@ r &quot; just wanted to document &quot; what was happening .
a question came to Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l &apos;s mind : &quot; do you want to document or are you trying to find a s@@ tory that you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
that s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ ism was informed by coun@@ t@@ less ins@@ tan@@ ces of people - often wh@@ ite - coming into a community to prof@@ it off its pain and res@@ ili@@ ence .
as F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an expla@@ ined in a recent inter@@ view , &quot; W@@ e had heard that people who are bor@@ n and raised in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on were not having their vo@@ ices c@@ ente@@ red , and we wanted to do it differ@@ ently . &quot;
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an had already linked up with co@@ -@@ direc@@ tor D@@ am@@ on D@@ av@@ is , an area ar@@ tis@@ t known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around death row in@@ ma@@ tes .
his involvement en@@ de@@ ared Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l to the project , along with six other loc@@ als the &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? &quot; te@@ am followed in the years after Bro@@ wn &apos;s sho@@ ot@@ ing .
&quot; this docu@@ mentary is not some@@ body speaking for us or speaking to us , it &apos;s us speaking , &quot; D@@ av@@ is said .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that &apos;s how I will be represented . &quot;
while the goal w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t to focus on Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l &apos;s experience - in an effort to show that the movement is &quot; not about a m@@ es@@ si@@ a@@ h lead@@ er but a community coming together , &quot; F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an said - she proved to be the most open of the fil@@ m &apos;s partici@@ pan@@ ts .
as a result , &quot; whose stre@@ ets ? &quot; documents surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l &apos;s life , like fall@@ ing in lo@@ ve and mar@@ rying her wi@@ f@@ e .
&quot; I felt like I was na@@ ked , &quot; said Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l , lau@@ gh@@ ing about the first time she saw the fin@@ ished product .
&quot; but I understood that with doing this work and human@@ iz@@ ing b@@ lack f@@ ol@@ ks , there has to be a level of v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability . &quot;
moreover , Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l &apos;s s@@ tory reite@@ rates and re@@ -@@ cen@@ ters the role of b@@ lack qu@@ e@@ er women in the broad@@ er B@@ lack lives matter movement .
two of the movement &apos;s three foun@@ ders - who co@@ ined # Bla@@ ck@@ L@@ iv@@ es@@ M@@ at@@ ter on social media in the after@@ mat@@ h of the 20@@ 12 kill@@ ing of b@@ lack teen Tra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tin - identi@@ fy as qu@@ e@@ er .
&quot; b@@ lack qu@@ e@@ er women in lead@@ ership has sustain@@ ed the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l , &quot; and that &apos;s because we &apos;@@ re constantly at b@@ attle on multi@@ ple fron@@ ts .
b@@ lack qu@@ e@@ er women have to bear the br@@ un@@ t of it all . &quot;
F@@ ol@@ a@@ y@@ an agreed no@@ ting that &quot; the movement is really up@@ held by b@@ lack women and a lot of qu@@ e@@ er b@@ lack women . &quot;
she ins@@ ists , however , that &quot; this is not some aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive action type of thing &quot; where Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l was ch@@ os@@ en as the fil@@ m &apos;s heart because of her id@@ ent@@ ities .
&quot; she was the person who was g@@ al@@ van@@ iz@@ ing this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a co@@ inc@@ idence though she was on the fron@@ t lines , because living life at those inter@@ sec@@ tions as a b@@ lack qu@@ e@@ er w@@ oman , you have so much on the line .
you can feel her energy through the s@@ cre@@ en . &quot;
mean@@ while , back in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the ne@@ ws ca@@ mer@@ as are long gone but f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght ra@@ cial ties between the community and police per@@ sis@@ t .
Fer@@ re@@ l@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ more years for b@@ loc@@ king a hi@@ gh@@ way during a demonstra@@ tion .
she descri@@ b@@ es the soci@@ o@@ -@@ political at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here of the area she calls home simply : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
still , she cl@@ ings to a ch@@ ant she &apos;s committed to m@@ em@@ ory since taking to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on &apos;s stre@@ ets a full three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to w@@ in .
we must lo@@ ve and support each other .
we have nothing to lose but our cha@@ ins . &quot;
a becoming res@@ emb@@ l@@ ance : ar@@ tis@@ t cre@@ ates por@@ tra@@ its using C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s D@@ N@@ A
in the cen@@ ter of the room at New Yor@@ k &apos;s F@@ rid@@ man G@@ all@@ ery are multi@@ ple fac@@ es - wh@@ ite , b@@ lack and bro@@ wn , each be@@ aring an almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble res@@ emb@@ l@@ ance to one another - suspen@@ ded on wi@@ res from the c@@ eil@@ ing .
the 30 por@@ tra@@ its were created by the ar@@ tis@@ t He@@ a@@ ther D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g from che@@ ek s@@ w@@ ab@@ s and ha@@ ir c@@ li@@ pp@@ ings sent to her by C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing .
man@@ ning sent the c@@ li@@ pp@@ ings from the For@@ t Le@@ a@@ ven@@ worth pris@@ on , where the former intell@@ ig@@ ence analys@@ t was ser@@ ving a 3@@ 5@@ -@@ year sen@@ tence after fam@@ ously lea@@ king classi@@ fied diplom@@ atic c@@ ab@@ les through the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ a@@ ks .
the new ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , which open@@ ed on 2 A@@ ug@@ ust , is tit@@ led A becoming res@@ emb@@ l@@ ance .
it &apos;s the product of two years of cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ence between D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine comb@@ ines her exper@@ t@@ ise in technology , com@@ pu@@ ter science and ar@@ t , and M@@ ann@@ ing , a tr@@ ans w@@ oman and pi@@ one@@ ering dis@@ sid@@ ent whose sen@@ tence was com@@ mu@@ ted by Bar@@ ac@@ k O@@ b@@ am@@ a when he had just three days left in office .
by al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ ically an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ing D@@ N@@ A ex@@ trac@@ ted from M@@ ann@@ ing and using it to create 30 por@@ tra@@ its of what some@@ one with that gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like , D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g has created a tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ant , if somewhat cer@@ eb@@ ral , com@@ mentary on not only the m@@ all@@ e@@ ability of D@@ N@@ A data - the many ways it can be interpre@@ ted , and the in@@ her@@ ent de@@ ter@@ minis@@ m of those interpre@@ tations - but also id@@ entity .
man@@ ning , who was bor@@ n B@@ rad@@ le@@ y E@@ d@@ ward but has spoken open@@ ly about identi@@ fying as a w@@ oman as early as ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , was con@@ vic@@ ted in 20@@ 13 on 20 char@@ ges , including six es@@ pi@@ on@@ age Ac@@ t viol@@ ations , com@@ pu@@ ter fraud and the@@ ft .
from pris@@ on , her im@@ age was repres@@ sed , so much so that there was just one p@@ ho@@ to - a gran@@ ular , bla@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ wh@@ ite sel@@ fi@@ e in which M@@ ann@@ ing , visi@@ bly une@@ as@@ y , sit@@ s in a dri@@ ver &apos;s se@@ at we@@ aring a pla@@ tin@@ um b@@ l@@ on@@ de wi@@ g - with which she bec@@ a@@ me associated .
in 20@@ 15 , D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g was coming off the mas@@ sive success of her 20@@ 12 project , str@@ ang@@ er v@@ isions .
in it , the ar@@ tis@@ t produced por@@ tra@@ its of str@@ ang@@ ers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like ci@@ gar@@ ette bu@@ t@@ ts and che@@ wing gu@@ m , ex@@ trac@@ ting D@@ N@@ A from the d@@ et@@ r@@ it@@ us to con@@ j@@ ure an im@@ age of what these f@@ ol@@ ks might look like .
that was when she received an em@@ ai@@ l from Paper M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine .
&quot; they were conduc@@ ting an inter@@ view with C@@ hel@@ sea M@@ ann@@ ing while she was in pris@@ on and they wanted some kind of por@@ tra@@ it to ac@@ company that ar@@ ticle , &quot; D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g expla@@ ined at a press pre@@ view of the new ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition .
and she cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be visi@@ ted and she cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t be p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ hed at that time , so they reached out to C@@ hel@@ sea and asked if she &apos;@@ d be interested in having a D@@ N@@ A por@@ tra@@ it made .
the ar@@ tis@@ t and her inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use bec@@ a@@ me un@@ likely p@@ en pal@@ s , ex@@ changing several let@@ ters over the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic bo@@ ok , sup@@ pres@@ sed I@@ ma@@ ges , ill@@ ustra@@ ted by S@@ ho@@ il@@ i K@@ an@@ un@@ go , that en@@ visi@@ on@@ ed a future where the presid@@ ent would com@@ mu@@ te C@@ hel@@ sea &apos;s sen@@ tence and she &apos;@@ d be able to see the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition in person .
that O@@ b@@ am@@ a would indeed call for M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s rele@@ ase just days after the bo@@ ok w@@ ent public was a welcome sort of ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity after s@@ even bru@@ tal years at a military pris@@ on in K@@ an@@ sa@@ s .
there &apos;s also something prof@@ ound and power@@ ful about the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition opening now , as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p w@@ ages war on government le@@ ak@@ ers and trans@@ gender tro@@ op@@ s while finding new , tw@@ e@@ e@@ table ways to further inf@@ la@@ me the star@@ k div@@ isions he &apos;s been called on to mend .
when asked about the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ti@@ ming of it all , D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said that &quot; things happen for a reason . &quot;
in an ar@@ tis@@ t statement written on the g@@ all@@ ery &apos;s w@@ all , M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s super@@ -@@ sized sig@@ nature bel@@ ow it ( the &quot; i &quot; in her last name d@@ ot@@ ted with a heart ) , called for an end to the &quot; autom@@ atic fac@@ tion@@ alism that gender , ra@@ ce , sex@@ u@@ ality , and culture have been the basis of . &quot;
on the opposite w@@ all is her m@@ ito@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ al D@@ N@@ A sequ@@ ence - a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de of C@@ s and G@@ s and A@@ s , written in pen@@ cil .
by including the 200 let@@ ters ( or n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , per the ar@@ tis@@ t &apos;s sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated scientific le@@ x@@ ic@@ on ) , D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g hop@@ ed to ill@@ ustra@@ te how as@@ t@@ oun@@ d@@ ingly similar , at least in bi@@ ological ma@@ ke@@ up , we all are .
&quot; what I &apos;@@ m hop@@ ing that people will take away from this is that our gen@@ ome do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t care about who we are , and how open gene@@ tic data is to interpre@@ tation , how sub@@ jec@@ tive it is , &quot; said D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose 200@@ 7 v@@ ide@@ o work , s@@ pu@@ ri@@ ous m@@ em@@ or@@ ies , is also on dis@@ play .
&quot; D@@ N@@ A data can tell so many different stor@@ ies , so this is 30 of those stor@@ ies . &quot;
the final pi@@ ece in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , which is contained in a single room , is one pa@@ ge from the a@@ fore@@ mentioned gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c no@@ v@@ ella .
it shows M@@ ann@@ ing , emer@@ ging , K@@ ing K@@ ong@@ -@@ es@@ que , from the United States D@@ isi@@ pl@@ in@@ ary bar@@ rac@@ ks with a spea@@ ker@@ ph@@ one in hand .
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , then they &apos;@@ ve w@@ on , &quot; it read@@ s .
&quot; so never sh@@ ut up . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she w@@ ro@@ te to me , &quot; the ar@@ tis@@ t , who ha@@ ils from P@@ hi@@ la@@ del@@ ph@@ ia , said .
&quot; I get go@@ os@@ e@@ bu@@ mp@@ s still talking about it . &quot;
man@@ ning has@@ n &apos;@@ t seen the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition in@@ -@@ person yet - as was so pres@@ ci@@ ently imag@@ ined in the com@@ ic bo@@ ok - but when she does , she &apos;@@ l@@ l be gre@@ e@@ ted in the cen@@ ter of the room by the mas@@ ks , her own gen@@ om@@ ic si@@ mu@@ la@@ cr@@ a con@@ g@@ reg@@ ated like h@@ ord@@ es of prote@@ s@@ ters .
that was pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful , too , as is everything in the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , down to the he@@ ight ( 5 &quot; 2 , M@@ ann@@ ing &apos;s sta@@ ture ) at which her gene@@ tic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written in pen@@ cil .
&quot; in the past , I &apos;@@ ve had them on the w@@ all but I wanted them to feel like a cro@@ w@@ d , &quot; D@@ e@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said of the por@@ tra@@ its .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was form@@ ing with C@@ hel@@ sea , like the movement that was behind fre@@ eing her as well . &quot;

a community al@@ er@@ t rele@@ ased by the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Pol@@ ice D@@ e@@ part@@ ment says the body was dis@@ covered on July 27 .
offic@@ ers received a call and arri@@ ved at the G@@ r@@ and P@@ la@@ z@@ a a@@ part@@ ments and found the victi@@ m with several la@@ cer@@ ations on his body .

La@@ them has been an associ@@ ate prof@@ ess@@ or of m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ology and im@@ mun@@ ology at nor@@ th@@ w@@ estern Uni@@ versity since 200@@ 7 .
Al@@ an K@@ . C@@ ub@@ b@@ age , the vice presid@@ ent for uni@@ versity relations , said in an em@@ a@@ iled statement that La@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been bann@@ ed from enter@@ ing nor@@ th@@ w@@ estern Uni@@ versity c@@ amp@@ uses .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter under investig@@ ation by the appropriate authorities , and nor@@ th@@ w@@ estern Uni@@ versity is co@@ operating in that investig@@ ation , &quot; C@@ ub@@ b@@ age said .
W@@ ar@@ ren is a sen@@ i@@ or t@@ reas@@ ur@@ y assis@@ tant at O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ versity .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for the uni@@ versity and S@@ om@@ er@@ ville C@@ olle@@ ge said in an em@@ a@@ iled statement that , &quot; W@@ e have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ating authorities in any way they need . &quot;
the statement added that W@@ ar@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ c@@ ked and want him to turn him@@ self in .
ch@@ i@@ ef Commun@@ ications O@@ ffic@@ er of the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Pol@@ ice D@@ e@@ part@@ ment An@@ th@@ on@@ y G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encoura@@ ges the sus@@ pects to sur@@ r@@ ender to authorities .
&quot; police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts but our efforts to loc@@ ate that are inten@@ si@@ fying , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the sus@@ pects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the G@@ r@@ and P@@ la@@ z@@ a building manag@@ er who had just received a cr@@ yp@@ tic ti@@ p that said something had oc@@ cur@@ red in a@@ part@@ ment 1@@ 00@@ 8 .
police described the sc@@ ene as very g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear if the inc@@ ident also oc@@ cur@@ red on July 27 .
La@@ them and W@@ ar@@ ren were confirmed to be at the building by security ca@@ mer@@ as , he said .
&quot; we believe Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or La@@ th@@ am and the victi@@ m had a relationship , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .

according to the police , the staff of the bo@@ o@@ ks@@ ho@@ p called the police on 23 May ,
as the man had threa@@ tened to &quot; b@@ low up the bo@@ o@@ ks@@ ho@@ p and k@@ ill all the Mus@@ lim@@ s . &quot;
the sus@@ pect left the sho@@ p after making his thre@@ ats .
M@@ off@@ at@@ t was ap@@ prehen@@ ded when he called the police to report a threat .

&quot; we &apos;@@ l@@ l complete W@@ A@@ DA ro@@ ad@@ ma@@ p in ne@@ ar future &quot; - Russian D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty p@@ m M@@ ut@@ ko
Russian D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty Prime Minister V@@ ita@@ ly M@@ ut@@ ko has said it will not take long to implement the remain@@ ing World An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) criteria for the re@@ ins@@ ta@@ te@@ ment of the Russian An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ing the road ma@@ p criteria has been carried out , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ob@@ tained the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ A@@ D ( UK An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing ) .
the W@@ A@@ DA ro@@ ad@@ ma@@ p was up@@ d@@ ated in this regard , &quot; M@@ ut@@ ko stated on Th@@ urs@@ day .
the p@@ m was com@@ men@@ ting on the second part of W@@ A@@ DA &apos;s Ro@@ ad@@ ma@@ p to C@@ od@@ e Com@@ pli@@ ance , which descri@@ b@@ es the criteria for the re@@ ins@@ ta@@ te@@ ment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and which recently published on the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation &apos;s we@@ b@@ sit@@ e .
according to M@@ ut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Ol@@ ymp@@ ic Committee &#91; I@@ O@@ C &#93; and W@@ A@@ DA in the ne@@ ar future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti@@ -@@ d@@ op@@ ing authorities must pub@@ lic@@ ally accept the re@@ ported out@@ comes of the W@@ A@@ D@@ A@@ -@@ san@@ c@@ tioned investig@@ ation by Can@@ ad@@ ian law@@ yer R@@ ic@@ hard Mc@@ L@@ ar@@ en on all@@ eg@@ ed sta@@ te@@ -@@ s@@ pon@@ so@@ red d@@ op@@ ing in Russian sport .
referring to the matter , M@@ ut@@ ko said : &quot; we are conduc@@ ting the investig@@ ation , as our anti@@ -@@ d@@ op@@ ing system ad@@ mitted a failure .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state pro@@ gra@@ ms , and we will not ad@@ mit something that d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t exist . &quot;
M@@ ut@@ ko &apos;s words ec@@ ho@@ ed those of V@@ ita@@ ly S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v , the head of Russia &apos;s In@@ dependent Public An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing Commission .
talking to Russian out@@ let R@@ S@@ port earlier in the day , S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v ad@@ mitted past problems in Russian anti@@ -@@ d@@ op@@ ing bodies , but added : &quot; we have said on numerous occasions , that the report contains contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one plans to accept this report un@@ cond@@ ition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mi@@ r@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was suspen@@ ded from car@@ rying out d@@ op@@ ing controls within Russia by W@@ A@@ DA in November 20@@ 15 in the wa@@ ke of the d@@ op@@ ing s@@ cand@@ al .
it was , however , per@@ mitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tes@@ ting under the super@@ vision of international experts and UK An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ op@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ A@@ D ) this June .
following a visit to the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation &apos;s head@@ quar@@ ters in Mos@@ co@@ w in July , W@@ A@@ DA Direc@@ tor General O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Nig@@ g@@ l@@ i stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be re@@ ins@@ ta@@ ted .
British organisation sc@@ ep@@ tical about bel@@ o@@ ved F@@ inn@@ ish innovation : &quot; no evidence &quot; of health benefits of ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity package
a British organisation doub@@ ts the benefits of F@@ inn@@ ish ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity packa@@ ges .
B@@ B@@ C and Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an , among others , report that Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust , a char@@ itable organisation aim@@ ing to prevent une@@ x@@ pec@@ ted de@@ a@@ ths in inf@@ an@@ cy , for@@ b@@ id@@ s the use of its bro@@ c@@ hu@@ res in ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity packa@@ ges han@@ ded over in the UK .
distribu@@ ting ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity packa@@ ges to all p@@ reg@@ n@@ ant women will start this month in Scot@@ land .
packa@@ ges will also be distribu@@ ted in some parts of Eng@@ land .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust , there is no evidence that the ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity package reduced the risk of su@@ d@@ den inf@@ ant death ,
a med@@ ical condition where a ba@@ by dies su@@ d@@ den@@ ly for no obvious reason .
Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust acts as an exper@@ t for health authorities in the UK in terms of a safe night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep for children .
&quot; we no longer per@@ mit our official bro@@ c@@ hu@@ res to be included in ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity packa@@ ges , as this would mean that we are in favour of this product , &quot; the organisation announced .
Fin@@ land has one of the low@@ est child mor@@ tal@@ ity rates in the world , only two de@@ a@@ ths per 1@@ ,@@ 000 b@@ ir@@ ths .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust , this low rate results from many reasons , such as the low number of teen rap@@ es .
&quot; han@@ ding out one package for each family may be a factor .
however , this cannot be said for certain , &quot; says Fran@@ c@@ ine B@@ ates , C@@ hi@@ ef Ex@@ ecu@@ tive of Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust .
&quot; we are concerned that ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity packa@@ ges are mar@@ ke@@ ted as products that reduce child mor@@ tal@@ ity and su@@ d@@ den inf@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths . &quot;
the ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity package is a F@@ inn@@ ish innovation , and it has been distribu@@ ted to all F@@ inn@@ ish mo@@ th@@ ers free of charge for 80 years .
the package contains various products , such as ba@@ by c@@ lo@@ th@@ es .
this year &apos;s package contains 5@@ 3 different products .
the package itself is a car@@ d@@ board bo@@ x in which b@@ ab@@ ies can s@@ le@@ ep .
according to the Scot@@ t@@ ish Government , the bo@@ x@@ es distribu@@ ted in Scot@@ land fulfil all safety standards .
Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust says that there is no safety standard set for car@@ d@@ board bo@@ x@@ es ac@@ ting as b@@ ed@@ s .
according to Lu@@ ll@@ a@@ by T@@ r@@ ust , the package may be the best option for a place to s@@ le@@ ep if no b@@ as@@ sin@@ et or cri@@ b is available .
the organisation only recom@@ men@@ ds the package for N@@ A@@ Ps and advis@@ es that its use should be sto@@ pped when the ba@@ by is able to turn to their side .
in addition , the organisation recom@@ men@@ ds that p@@ ets be kept away from the package and that it is not allowed to get di@@ r@@ ty or w@@ et .
F@@ le@@ et@@ -@@ fo@@ o@@ ted tor@@ to@@ is@@ e es@@ cap@@ ed again from a Jap@@ an@@ ese z@@ o@@ o
staff at a Jap@@ an@@ ese z@@ o@@ o looking for an es@@ cap@@ ed tor@@ to@@ is@@ e .
the quic@@ k@@ ness of the gi@@ ant tor@@ to@@ is@@ e has taken the staff by surpris@@ e , as the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e made its second es@@ cap@@ e in two weeks .
the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e es@@ cap@@ ed from the S@@ hi@@ bu@@ ka@@ w@@ a z@@ o@@ o loc@@ ated in O@@ ka@@ y@@ am@@ a in w@@ estern Jap@@ an on Tu@@ es@@ day morning .
the security fo@@ o@@ ta@@ ge shows that the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e es@@ cap@@ ed through the main entr@@ ance .
&quot; it w@@ on &apos;@@ t di@@ e quickly because it &apos;@@ l@@ l e@@ at g@@ ras@@ s around the z@@ o@@ o , but we are very concerned , &quot; says Y@@ os@@ him@@ i Y@@ aman@@ e , a z@@ o@@ o employe@@ e .
the es@@ cap@@ ed 3@@ 5@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old tor@@ to@@ is@@ e is f@@ em@@ ale , w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s 55 k@@ g and is about 1 m in l@@ eng@@ th .
Y@@ aman@@ e says that the fu@@ g@@ itive has a qu@@ i@@ et and kind nature .
during opening hours , the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e is allowed to move around fre@@ ely in the z@@ o@@ o .
the z@@ o@@ o has not received any e@@ ye@@ wit@@ ness accoun@@ ts of the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e .
the tor@@ to@@ is@@ e made its previous es@@ cap@@ e two weeks ago .
Y@@ aman@@ e dis@@ covered it w@@ al@@ king on a road some 1@@ 50 m from the z@@ o@@ o .
&quot; I saw it on my way to the z@@ o@@ o .
I sto@@ pped my c@@ ar and asked my colleagues to help me , &quot; Y@@ aman@@ e said .
&quot; it can w@@ al@@ k fas@@ ter than we could ever imag@@ ine . &quot;
the star@@ t@@ -@@ up@@ s that will help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ ber
A@@ my E@@ r@@ re@@ t@@ t wanted to g@@ au@@ ge employe@@ e happ@@ in@@ ess at her e@@ -@@ commer@@ ce star@@ t@@ -@@ up , but sur@@ ve@@ ys w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t working .
respon@@ ses were often va@@ gue , un@@ help@@ ful or , worse , dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful .
and even if she promis@@ ed an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity , some workers d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t trust the process .
&quot; it just never had consisten@@ cy and objec@@ ti@@ vity , &quot; said E@@ r@@ re@@ t@@ t , who run@@ s the 7@@ 5@@ -@@ person S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co e@@ -@@ commer@@ ce ha@@ ir care company Mad@@ is@@ on Re@@ ed .
so she called in out@@ sid@@ ers for help .
a new bre@@ ed of human resources star@@ t@@ -@@ up@@ s is cro@@ pp@@ ing up to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
by building and lic@@ ens@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that has the specific purpose of me@@ as@@ uring employe@@ e eng@@ ag@@ ement , they allow companies to do s@@ na@@ p p@@ oll@@ s , target specific te@@ am@@ s and dem@@ ogra@@ p@@ hi@@ c groups , offer employees an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity and compla@@ in@@ t ho@@ t@@ lines , and in some cases allow wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ w@@ ers to by@@ pass C@@ -@@ su@@ ite execu@@ tives and go stra@@ ight to the board of direc@@ tors .
&quot; you &apos;@@ ve now got to@@ ols such as S@@ tra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit for trac@@ king your health , but where &apos;s the F@@ it@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said J@@ im Bar@@ net@@ t , co@@ -@@ foun@@ der and ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive of R@@ ed@@ w@@ ood C@@ ity star@@ t@@ -@@ up g@@ lin@@ t , whose so@@ f@@ tw@@ are an@@ al@@ y@@ tics to@@ ols are used by companies to measure employe@@ e eng@@ ag@@ ement .
E@@ r@@ re@@ t@@ t said she gain@@ ed more in@@ si@@ ght into what her employees were thinking and feel@@ ing in three years using g@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the s@@ na@@ p sur@@ ve@@ ys and p@@ oll@@ s of specific te@@ am@@ s , it off@@ ers a he@@ at ma@@ p of the company show@@ ing at a g@@ l@@ ance which un@@ its have the most compla@@ ints and which manag@@ ers have low approval s@@ co@@ res - allowing her to d@@ r@@ ill down on why .
companies are coming to re@@ ali@@ z@@ e they must sta@@ y on top of their work@@ place culture , l@@ est they become the next U@@ ber , which has been en@@ m@@ es@@ hed in s@@ cand@@ al since a former employe@@ e published a blo@@ g post descri@@ b@@ ing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who spoke out were pun@@ ished .
for star@@ t@@ -@@ up@@ s such as g@@ lin@@ t , this desire for over@@ si@@ ght is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 11@@ 8@@ .@@ 7 billion by 20@@ 20 , according to finance te@@ ch in@@ si@@ ghts we@@ b@@ sit@@ e L@@ et &apos;s talk payments .
D@@ en@@ ver , C@@ ol@@ o . , star@@ t@@ -@@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which help@@ s companies prevent and de@@ te@@ c@@ t bad beha@@ vi@@ or , saw an up@@ tic@@ k in interest and activity earlier this year a@@ mid U@@ ber &apos;s fall into dis@@ re@@ pu@@ te .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has ne@@ arly 6@@ 00 c@@ li@@ ents , including A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b , M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft , and T@@ es@@ l@@ a .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a c@@ li@@ ent .
like g@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent l@@ ets companies send custom@@ iz@@ ed &quot; pul@@ se &quot; sur@@ ve@@ ys , ga@@ ther conf@@ id@@ ential respon@@ ses in real time , and view he@@ at ma@@ ps of its problem areas .
it also off@@ ers an an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous tex@@ ting ho@@ t@@ line that l@@ ets employees report bad beha@@ vi@@ or .
and if the ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive is impl@@ icated , compla@@ ints go stra@@ ight to the board of direc@@ tors .
&quot; the court of public opinion has us@@ ur@@ p@@ ed regula@@ tors , &quot; said Pat@@ ric@@ k Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an , the foun@@ der and ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found to tre@@ at its employees poor@@ ly or be@@ have une@@ th@@ ically , even if regula@@ tors d@@ on &apos;@@ t step in , it can face cos@@ tly consequences from consumer bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ ts , employe@@ e at@@ tr@@ ition and law@@ su@@ its , Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an said .
Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day , the res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant cha@@ in with more than 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 employees across 500 loc@@ ations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its cor@@ por@@ ate head@@ quar@@ ters .
pre@@ viously , if an employe@@ e wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a ph@@ one number or em@@ ai@@ l for cor@@ por@@ ate head@@ quar@@ ters , lo@@ d@@ ge a formal compla@@ in@@ t , and hope it was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ating and un@@ com@@ for@@ table experience , said J@@ am@@ es V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s general coun@@ se@@ l , who said there was no good way of trac@@ king employe@@ e compla@@ ints .
now that the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , though , problems that were pre@@ viously hid@@ den from execu@@ tives who s@@ at in offic@@ es c@@ ities or states away - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair w@@ age practices - can be more quickly identi@@ fied and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to that hol@@ istic , 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ degree view into the employment experience , &quot; said V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , who over@@ se@@ es Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we &apos;@@ re protecting our shar@@ eh@@ ol@@ ders from employment l@@ iti@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
companies started taking eth@@ ics , values and employe@@ e eng@@ ag@@ ement more seriously in 2002 after accoun@@ ting firm Ar@@ th@@ ur An@@ der@@ sen coll@@ ap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical viol@@ ations from the En@@ ron s@@ cand@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ l@@ an said .
but it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t until &quot; social media came into its own &quot; that companies re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t stop their di@@ r@@ ty la@@ und@@ ry from going vi@@ ral on@@ line .
&quot; pri@@ or to using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both g@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their so@@ f@@ tw@@ are as a service , char@@ ging companies rec@@ ur@@ ring fe@@ es to use their products .
it &apos;s a business model and opportunity that has the approval of ven@@ ture capital inves@@ tors , who have pro@@ pped up both star@@ t@@ -@@ up@@ s .
Con@@ ver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in February from fir@@ ms such as S@@ app@@ h@@ ire ven@@ tures and T@@ ol@@ a C@@ ap@@ ital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 4@@ 7 million .
g@@ lin@@ t secu@@ red $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ em@@ er V@@ en@@ ture Par@@ t@@ ners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments har@@ dly come as a surpris@@ e , given the inter@@ connec@@ ted nature of companies , culture and ven@@ ture capital .
there &apos;s a growing body of research show@@ ing today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
in competitive markets such as S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ alle@@ y , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are merely table sta@@ kes .
employees want to feel that they &apos;@@ re accepted and valu@@ ed and that they &apos;@@ re giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be at a company , feel their vo@@ ices are heard , and that the work they are doing is re@@ war@@ ding , they are more committed to making that company successful , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ een , vice presid@@ ent of global benefits and employe@@ e experience at L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ I@@ n , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t .
inves@@ tors achieve re@@ tur@@ ns when their por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and eng@@ aged .
if thir@@ d@@ -@@ party an@@ al@@ y@@ tics to@@ ols promis@@ e to increase employe@@ e commitment and eng@@ ag@@ ement , it &apos;s no wonder they &apos;@@ re finding bac@@ king .
having data on employe@@ e eng@@ ag@@ ement is important , according to work@@ place culture experts .
but the data are us@@ eless unless a company &apos;s cus@@ to@@ di@@ ans take action .
in fact , if a company as@@ ks employees for their fe@@ ed@@ back , it can set an expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if change do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t come f@@ ast enough , or at all , it can bre@@ ed disap@@ poin@@ tment and make employees dis@@ eng@@ aged .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re going to ask for 4@@ ,@@ 000 sugges@@ tions , you need to be prepared to have 4@@ ,@@ 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; said Rus@@ sel@@ l R@@ a@@ at@@ h , presid@@ ent of consul@@ ting at business management firm K@@ ot@@ ter International , who has seen companies make the mis@@ take of re@@ lying too much on data collec@@ tion .
&quot; because if you d@@ on &apos;@@ t follow through , employees will wonder , &apos; did you really hear me ?
do you care ?
and if you d@@ on &apos;@@ t care , why should I care ? &apos; &quot;
Mad@@ is@@ on Re@@ ed , which now does mon@@ th@@ ly employe@@ e sur@@ ve@@ ys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is re@@ ported on g@@ lin@@ t , according to E@@ r@@ re@@ t@@ t .
and , after ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ ed@@ back from employees f@@ r@@ ustra@@ ted by the speed of decisi@@ on@@ -@@ making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organ@@ iz@@ e several te@@ am@@ s within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
over at Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day , the company is getting new in@@ si@@ ght on its employees , and it &apos;s hop@@ ing that in the long run , this will conver@@ t to better re@@ ten@@ tion of workers in an industry known for high tur@@ no@@ ver .
&quot; if you &apos;@@ re not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you &apos;@@ re going to lose people , &quot; V@@ it@@ ran@@ o said .
&quot; and if you lose people , you &apos;@@ re going to lose custom@@ ers .
and when you lose custom@@ ers , you &apos;@@ re going to lose companies . &quot;
T@@ T ne@@ ws agency reports that a 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man is sus@@ pec@@ ted of taking v@@ ide@@ os of his na@@ ked neigh@@ b@@ our without her con@@ sent in Sweden .
the w@@ oman living in Go@@ th@@ en@@ burg had g@@ ot@@ ten out of the show@@ er at her home when she no@@ tic@@ ed a mo@@ b@@ ile ph@@ one suspen@@ ded from a cor@@ d outside her w@@ in@@ do@@ w .
she said that the ph@@ one was rec@@ ord@@ ing a v@@ ide@@ o of her a@@ part@@ ment .
the star@@ t@@ led w@@ oman ran into another room to put some c@@ lo@@ th@@ es on .
when she re@@ turned to chec@@ k the situation , the mo@@ b@@ ile ph@@ one was first pu@@ ll@@ ed up but quickly low@@ ered down again .
the 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old sus@@ pect ad@@ mitted that he took a v@@ ide@@ o of the w@@ oman .
however , he claim@@ ed that he was only sho@@ ot@@ ing her face .
the v@@ ide@@ o was del@@ e@@ ted and the police was unable to rec@@ over it as evidence .
during inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations , the man ad@@ mitted to sho@@ ot@@ ing the v@@ ide@@ o , but d@@ eni@@ ed being gu@@ il@@ ty of any crime .
when asked why he took the v@@ ide@@ o , the man said that he &apos;s &quot; cra@@ z@@ y &quot; in lo@@ ve with his neigh@@ b@@ our .

te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers demand more money during autu@@ m@@ n negotiations
O@@ ll@@ i L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen , presid@@ ent of the Trade Union of E@@ duc@@ ation ( O@@ A@@ J ) , said on Th@@ urs@@ day that the development of sal@@ aries cannot be lower than , for example , in the ex@@ ports industry .
he points out that temporary cu@@ ts in hol@@ id@@ ay pay in the public sector emphasise this difference .
&quot; we are not able to make de@@ als in which these hol@@ id@@ ay pay cu@@ ts were not included in one way or another . &quot;
in the mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al sector , agreements are only possible after similar agreements have been signed in the private sector and any increas@@ es in them are known .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen estima@@ tes that O@@ A@@ J will reach an agreement on employment terms in January .
he is still to re@@ ve@@ al his tar@@ ge@@ ted increase rates .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen is also the presid@@ ent of the negoti@@ ation Organisation for Public Sec@@ tor profession@@ als ( J@@ U@@ K@@ O ) .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen : hol@@ id@@ ay pay cu@@ ts increase differences in income development
according to O@@ A@@ J , statistics and estima@@ tes indic@@ ate that the pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power of public sector employees will dec@@ reas@@ e , while that of private sector employees will increase .
L@@ uu@@ k@@ ka@@ inen says that temporary hol@@ id@@ ay pay cu@@ ts increase these differences further .
Fin@@ land should define how many stud@@ ents a single te@@ ac@@ her can have
O@@ A@@ J also points out that equality must be en@@ su@@ red in basic education , as differences between the best and wor@@ st stud@@ ents are continu@@ ously increasing .
according to O@@ A@@ J , learning results are dec@@ reas@@ ing and differences between individuals and regions are increasing .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimin@@ ation of tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices makes for a long day for the B@@ ru@@ ins
it &apos;s pus@@ hing 11 p.m. as a th@@ r@@ ong of U@@ C@@ L@@ A foot@@ b@@ all pla@@ yers l@@ ing@@ er to ch@@ at on one side of the te@@ am &apos;s new on@@ -@@ cam@@ pu@@ s practice fields .
some have pe@@ el@@ ed off their j@@ er@@ se@@ y to@@ ps , re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing bac@@ ks s@@ lic@@ k with s@@ we@@ at from the to@@ il of the first day of training cam@@ p .
for a good ch@@ un@@ k of the te@@ am , these id@@ le minu@@ tes constitute a mid@@ day break .
pla@@ yers en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed in sum@@ mer cl@@ ass@@ es will head back to their d@@ or@@ ms after the thre@@ e@@ -@@ h@@ our practice to study for final ex@@ am@@ s before re@@ turning to the W@@ as@@ ser@@ man F@@ o@@ ot@@ b@@ all C@@ enter for meetings at 6 : 30 the following morning .
&quot; this is a g@@ rin@@ d for these gu@@ ys the next three days , &quot; B@@ ru@@ ins co@@ ach J@@ im Mor@@ a said not long before Mon@@ day turned into Tu@@ es@@ day .
the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s elimin@@ ation of tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices , designed to li@@ gh@@ ten the lo@@ ad on pla@@ yers , has actually l@@ eng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until fin@@ als end F@@ rid@@ ay .
that &apos;s why U@@ C@@ L@@ A &apos;s first three practices were sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to ac@@ comm@@ od@@ ate pla@@ yers &apos; already cra@@ m@@ med sch@@ ed@@ ules .
the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off from no tw@@ o@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days is more one@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days , the B@@ ru@@ ins pus@@ hing up the start of cam@@ p ne@@ arly a week from last se@@ as@@ on and holding practices during sum@@ mer scho@@ ol for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six se@@ as@@ ons in W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood .
they are sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to hold 18 practices through A@@ ug@@ . 20 before beginning formal ga@@ me prepar@@ ations for their open@@ er against T@@ ex@@ as A &a@@ mp@@ ; M on Sep@@ t .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if it did add another item to pla@@ yers &apos; bus@@ y it@@ in@@ er@@ aries .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re putting this enormous lo@@ ad on them for three or four days and it &apos;s very challeng@@ ing , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they &apos;@@ ve just pus@@ hed through it ; they g@@ rin@@ d , they &apos;@@ re great kid@@ s .
I think once we get to Sa@@ tur@@ day and we &apos;@@ l@@ l have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
U@@ C@@ L@@ A will close its practices once cam@@ p is fin@@ ished , no easy task given the clear si@@ ght lines of its fields from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent par@@ king lot and the ad@@ join@@ ing L@@ us@@ kin C@@ enter , an up@@ scale ho@@ te@@ l that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ b@@ all@@ s that cle@@ ared a protec@@ tive net behind a go@@ al@@ post .
B@@ ru@@ ins pla@@ yers are sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to occ@@ up@@ y the ho@@ te@@ l beginning this wee@@ ken@@ d , but Mor@@ a acknowled@@ ged that there could be an issue once those ro@@ oms are va@@ c@@ ant during the se@@ as@@ on .
&quot; we will have security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; that is a real concern and it &apos;s not f@@ ar@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched to think that people can r@@ ent a room and sit up there and v@@ ide@@ o@@ ta@@ pe a practice .
if you have v@@ ide@@ o@@ ta@@ pe of a practice , it &apos;s a pre@@ tty good deal .
but we &apos;@@ l@@ l have security there and we &apos;@@ l@@ l have security up in par@@ king L@@ ot 8 .
we &apos;@@ l@@ l do the best we can with what we got .
I &apos;@@ m not going to wor@@ ry too much about it .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
freedom in R@@ wan@@ da
a presid@@ ential election will be held in R@@ wan@@ da in central Africa on F@@ rid@@ ay with little doubt over the w@@ inn@@ er .
P@@ au@@ l K@@ ag@@ a@@ me is offici@@ ally aim@@ ing for his third term but , in practice , he has had his say in leading the country since 1994 .
that was when the R@@ wan@@ d@@ an Pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tic F@@ ron@@ t ( R@@ P@@ F ) sto@@ pped the gen@@ oc@@ ide organised by Hu@@ t@@ u extre@@ mis@@ ts .
the R@@ P@@ F was led by K@@ ag@@ a@@ me .
K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has been critic@@ ised , for example , for cr@@ us@@ hing the opposition and lim@@ iting freedom of speech .
he has also been acc@@ used of distor@@ ting poverty statistics .
K@@ ag@@ a@@ me is able to run for his third term because the constitution , lim@@ iting the presidency to two terms , was amended .

during his presidency , social reforms have been made and international investments have flo@@ wn into the country .
what is more , K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has played an important part in uni@@ fying the country divid@@ ed by the gen@@ oc@@ ide .
the success of R@@ wan@@ da has made many Afric@@ ans doubt whether a liber@@ al multi@@ -@@ party democracy is the right way for African states .
however , K@@ ag@@ a@@ me has promis@@ ed more freedom for R@@ wan@@ d@@ ans once the country is back on its fe@@ et .
now would be a good time to start .
F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok to step up fac@@ t@@ -@@ chec@@ king in fight against fa@@ ke ne@@ ws

F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok has been critic@@ iz@@ ed as being one of the main distribution points for so@@ -@@ called fa@@ ke ne@@ ws , which many think influ@@ enc@@ ed the 20@@ 16 U@@ .@@ S@@ . presid@@ ential election .
the issue has also become a big political to@@ pi@@ c in Europe , with French vo@@ ters del@@ u@@ ged with fal@@ se stor@@ ies ahead of the presid@@ ential election in May and Germany bac@@ king a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to re@@ move ha@@ te@@ ful post@@ ings pro@@ mp@@ tly , ahead of elections there in September .
on Th@@ urs@@ day F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fac@@ t@@ -@@ chec@@ king fe@@ a@@ ture was being laun@@ ched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to seeing which stor@@ ies are dispu@@ ted by thir@@ d@@ -@@ party fact chec@@ kers , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said S@@ ar@@ a S@@ u , F@@ ace@@ bo@@ ok ne@@ ws feed product manag@@ er , in a blo@@ g .

building a gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel : a Cas@@ t@@ le in Eng@@ land &apos;s s@@ tory
in its recent past , the d@@ imin@@ u@@ tive Scot@@ ne@@ y Cas@@ t@@ le has fe@@ atu@@ red in a s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e mu@@ si@@ c v@@ ide@@ o and been a b@@ ol@@ th@@ ole for Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ ha@@ t@@ ch@@ er during the 197@@ 0@@ s and 198@@ 0@@ s .
but Scot@@ ne@@ y has wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed 7@@ 00 years of tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous history from its cos@@ y se@@ at in B@@ e@@ w@@ l R@@ iv@@ er vall@@ e@@ y in K@@ ent , now ins@@ pi@@ ration for a gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel written by J@@ a@@ mi@@ e R@@ ho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ -@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ ks@@ hi@@ re@@ man with a pen@@ ch@@ ant for histor@@ ical documents .
&quot; I find it so be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful to look at the hand@@ wr@@ iting of some@@ one who has been de@@ ad for 300 years , &quot; he says wis@@ t@@ fully .
&quot; what a personal connection , to hold that letter in my hand . &quot;
sp@@ ann@@ ing the m@@ iddle ages to the E@@ d@@ war@@ di@@ an er@@ a , A Cas@@ t@@ le in Eng@@ land documents the families that li@@ ved in Scot@@ ne@@ y , with each s@@ tory ill@@ ustra@@ ted by a different , up@@ coming UK ar@@ tis@@ t - I@@ sa@@ a@@ c L@@ en@@ ki@@ e@@ w@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ on@@ y May S@@ mit@@ h , W@@ ill@@ i@@ am Ex@@ le@@ y , B@@ ec@@ ky Pal@@ mer and I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Gre@@ en@@ ber@@ g .
it is not R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s first bo@@ ok based on an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve : he also w@@ ro@@ te 20@@ 14 &apos;s D@@ e@@ ad M@@ en &apos;s teet@@ h and O@@ ther stor@@ ies , a collec@@ tion ins@@ pi@@ red by documents in the British Li@@ br@@ ary - a project he found une@@ x@@ pec@@ tedly em@@ o@@ tional .
&quot; I w@@ ell@@ ed up at just the th@@ um@@ b@@ prin@@ t on the side of a letter , written by a double ag@@ ent in the 17@@ 00@@ s who was working for the J@@ ac@@ ob@@ ite@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his th@@ um@@ b@@ prin@@ t !
and let@@ ters always sm@@ el@@ l like smo@@ ke because , back then , you li@@ t a fir@@ e for light .
to some@@ one 300 years in the future , the sm@@ el@@ l makes it feel like they &apos;@@ re there , too .
a@@ h , I lo@@ ve ar@@ ch@@ iv@@ es ! &quot;
for some@@ one so s@@ mit@@ ten with old paper@@ s , getting support from the N@@ ational T@@ r@@ ust and Ar@@ ts Council Eng@@ land and living in a cas@@ t@@ le for almost four months ( &quot; I over@@ sta@@ yed my welcome a little bit , to be hon@@ est &quot; ) seems too good to be true .
R@@ ho@@ des spent his days expl@@ or@@ ing the V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; cas@@ t@@ le , going through the ar@@ ch@@ iv@@ es and stud@@ ying the man@@ or &apos;s many t@@ reas@@ ures and cu@@ ri@@ os , such as the moun@@ ted hy@@ ena head@@ s on the w@@ all@@ s and b@@ ot@@ t@@ les that had spent cen@@ tu@@ ries in the mo@@ at .
he wan@@ der@@ ed the grounds and the ru@@ ins of the old cas@@ t@@ le , talking to rang@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes the ar@@ tis@@ ts at work on his bo@@ ok &apos;s ill@@ ustra@@ tions .
then at night , he &apos;@@ d &quot; d@@ rin@@ k wh@@ is@@ key and get wr@@ iting . &quot;
the inti@@ ma@@ te history of Scot@@ ne@@ y is rela@@ tively un@@ known , as the N@@ ational T@@ r@@ ust had only gain@@ ed full access in 2006 when the final he@@ ir , E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h H@@ us@@ se@@ y , di@@ ed .
when R@@ ho@@ des arri@@ ved a dec@@ ade later , staff were only starting to tackle the ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve , which he descri@@ b@@ es as &quot; hund@@ re@@ ds of years of ar@@ is@@ to@@ c@@ rats going : &apos; O@@ h , s@@ tic@@ k it in the lo@@ ft &apos; . &quot;
di@@ aries , let@@ ters from the days of the Eng@@ lis@@ h emp@@ ire , ma@@ ps out@@ lin@@ ing who ow@@ ned what : &quot; you &apos;@@ d think land dispu@@ tes would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des , &quot; but there was this one b@@ ir@@ ch tre@@ e two families were fighting over .
just let it go , gu@@ ys ! &quot;
some of the stor@@ ies in the collec@@ tion use the cas@@ t@@ le as a ju@@ mp@@ ing@@ -@@ off point to del@@ ve more broad@@ ly into Eng@@ lis@@ h history , including The L@@ ab@@ ou@@ re@@ r , which follow@@ s a man who lea@@ ves the new@@ ly buil@@ t cas@@ t@@ le to join the 13@@ 8@@ 1 pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; re@@ vol@@ t .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot happening at the cas@@ t@@ le in 13@@ 80 , in this bo@@ ok called the K@@ ni@@ ghtly F@@ am@@ il@@ ies of K@@ ent and S@@ us@@ se@@ x , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; re@@ vol@@ t started in that area and I thought , a ri@@ ot is a good place to start .
ma@@ y@@ be the two are connec@@ ted ? &quot;
other stor@@ ies are ro@@ o@@ ted firmly in the history of the cas@@ t@@ le - such as The pri@@ est , which tell@@ s the ta@@ le of the J@@ es@@ u@@ it pri@@ est whom the D@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l family hi@@ d for s@@ even years during the Eng@@ lis@@ h Re@@ for@@ mation .
or The s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler , which fe@@ a@@ tures 18@@ th@@ -@@ century contra@@ ban@@ der Ar@@ th@@ ur D@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l , who is thought to have sta@@ ged his own f@@ un@@ er@@ al by fill@@ ing a co@@ ff@@ in with ro@@ cks ( a dis@@ co@@ very made years later when his co@@ ff@@ in was une@@ ar@@ th@@ ed ) .
the D@@ ar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s fav@@ our@@ ite Scot@@ ne@@ y family : &quot; the gentlemen seem@@ ed to be quite ro@@ gu@@ ish , always getting into debt and spending money on things they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t affor@@ d .
different gener@@ ations of D@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ l men sol@@ ved their debt cris@@ es by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imag@@ ine them as a b@@ un@@ ch of hand@@ some gu@@ ys , with a k@@ n@@ ac@@ k for w@@ o@@ o@@ ing he@@ i@@ res@@ ses . &quot;
with his as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment in the cas@@ t@@ le over , R@@ ho@@ des is on the hun@@ t for other sing@@ ular wr@@ iting experi@@ ences .
he has comple@@ ted a tw@@ o@@ -@@ week s@@ tin@@ t in the F@@ inn@@ ish w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for a gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel about E@@ l@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the sit@@ e of an early 20@@ th@@ -@@ century san@@ ator@@ ium that has since been rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed by nature .
but Scot@@ ne@@ y hol@@ ds a special place for him .
&quot; I was sa@@ d to leave , &quot; he says .
&quot; it was like : &apos; a@@ h , I &apos;@@ ve got to go deal with f@@ uc@@ king real life now . &apos; &quot;
wor@@ st relations with Russia since the C@@ old W@@ ar
J@@ ens S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , NATO Secre@@ tary General , com@@ men@@ ted on Th@@ urs@@ day that relations between NATO and Russia have become signific@@ antly col@@ der .
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g bla@@ med Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukra@@ ine .
&quot; I think it is correct to say that NATO &apos;s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , &quot; S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g told C@@ N@@ N .
&quot; at the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , we hop@@ ed to develop a close partnership with Russia .
but especially after the illegal anne@@ x@@ ation of C@@ r@@ im@@ e@@ a in 20@@ 14 and the continued Russian des@@ tab@@ il@@ isation of eas@@ tern Ukra@@ ine , the relationship between NATO and Russia has de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated consider@@ ably . &quot;
according to S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , NATO is still committed to avoid@@ ing a further sp@@ ik@@ e in ten@@ sions .
&quot; as long as we are strong , as long as we are pre@@ dic@@ table , we can also eng@@ age in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid es@@ cal@@ ation and avoid a new C@@ old W@@ ar . &quot;
S@@ tol@@ ten@@ ber@@ g &apos;s remarks came as D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p stated that the relationship between the USA and Russia is at an all@@ -@@ time and very dangerous low .
tr@@ um@@ p bla@@ med the US C@@ ong@@ ress for the poor relationship , as it approved new sanctions on Russia last week .

Ukra@@ in@@ ian K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko , 41 , announced his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment on Th@@ urs@@ day morning .
g@@ old med@@ all@@ ist at the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic G@@ am@@ es in A@@ tlan@@ ta in 1996 , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko had 6@@ 9 fi@@ ghts as a professional , w@@ inning 6@@ 4 times .
he held different tit@@ les in 200@@ 0@@ -@@ 2002 and in 200@@ 6@@ -@@ 20@@ 15 .
K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko lost the two last fi@@ ghts of his care@@ er .
T@@ ys@@ on fur@@ y be@@ at him by the unanim@@ ous decision of the jud@@ ges in November 20@@ 15 .
in April this year , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko faced An@@ th@@ on@@ y J@@ os@@ hu@@ a at W@@ emb@@ le@@ y Sta@@ di@@ um and lost the fi@@ er@@ ce fight via technical kno@@ ck@@ out in the 11@@ th round .
J@@ os@@ hu@@ a and K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko were expected to have a re@@ mat@@ ch in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as in November .
however , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko was unable to find mo@@ ti@@ vation for the fight .
&quot; I deliber@@ ately took a few weeks to make my decision , to make sure I had enough dis@@ tance from the fight at W@@ emb@@ le@@ y Sta@@ di@@ um , &quot; K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko told in his press rele@@ ase .
&quot; as an a@@ ma@@ te@@ ur and a professional bo@@ x@@ er , I have achieved everything I dre@@ am@@ ed of , and now I want to start my second care@@ er after s@@ ports .
I would have never imag@@ ined that I would have such a long and inc@@ redi@@ bly successful bo@@ x@@ ing care@@ er .
I &apos;@@ m very than@@ k@@ ful for this . &quot;

K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s manag@@ er Ber@@ n@@ d B@@ ö@@ n@@ te told that the decision to re@@ ti@@ re was a difficult one .
&quot; but he has always emphas@@ ised that he wanted to re@@ ti@@ re if he d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have enough mo@@ ti@@ vation any@@ more .
therefore this is defin@@ iti@@ vely the right decision , &quot; B@@ ö@@ n@@ te said .
since 200@@ 9 , K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko has been with American ac@@ t@@ ress Ha@@ yd@@ en P@@ an@@ et@@ ti@@ ere .
they have one child , Ka@@ y@@ a , bor@@ n in 20@@ 14 .
K@@ l@@ it@@ s@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s ol@@ der bro@@ ther Vi@@ tal@@ i is also a former he@@ av@@ y@@ w@@ eight cha@@ mp@@ ion .
in 200@@ 8@@ -@@ 20@@ 12 , the two bro@@ th@@ ers domin@@ ated international bo@@ x@@ ing by holding the tit@@ les of different bo@@ x@@ ing feder@@ ations at the same time .

this sum@@ mer , wea@@ ther conditions have been against pol@@ e va@@ ul@@ ter M@@ inn@@ a N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en .
&quot; I W@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t like to bla@@ me the tra@@ ck , but it &apos;s in@@ conc@@ ei@@ va@@ ble that I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t even get my shor@@ ter pol@@ es working properly , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said after her competition in I@@ nn@@ s@@ br@@ uc@@ k .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve compe@@ ted and train@@ ed here who knows how many times , and I &apos;@@ ve never seen such changing w@@ in@@ ds before , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said during P@@ a@@ a@@ v@@ o N@@ ur@@ mi G@@ am@@ es .
&quot; this se@@ as@@ on , it &apos;s been very hard to j@@ um@@ p ste@@ ad@@ ily , as the w@@ in@@ ds have been so er@@ ratic , even during practice , &quot; N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en said at Kal@@ ev@@ an K@@ is@@ at .
the wea@@ ther was also a ho@@ t to@@ pi@@ c in L@@ on@@ d@@ on on Th@@ urs@@ day .
&quot; it &apos;s been a challenge to keep my tech@@ ni@@ que in@@ tac@@ t . I d@@ on &apos;@@ t know if it &apos;s the c@@ old wea@@ ther or what .
it &apos;s been c@@ old and w@@ ind@@ y , and it has really spo@@ il@@ t the mo@@ od .
there &apos;s no point in consum@@ ing energy in bad conditions . &quot;

out@@ do@@ ors , she has reached 4@@ 45 .
the conditions are not the same for everyone in L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
it is important to sta@@ y pati@@ ent and wait for better w@@ in@@ ds .
N@@ ik@@ k@@ an@@ en &apos;s goal is to j@@ um@@ p 4@@ 60 on F@@ rid@@ ay and make it to the fin@@ als .
why w@@ on &apos;@@ t you tra@@ in ab@@ road ?
&quot; that &apos;s not necessary .
early last se@@ as@@ on , I train@@ ed in Italy and Germany .
I got my tech@@ ni@@ que together and sta@@ ble .
this year , I probably should have done the same .
nor@@ m@@ ally , I &apos;@@ ve been able to tra@@ in in@@ do@@ ors , but now the fac@@ ility has been closed . &quot;
what would be ide@@ al wea@@ ther conditions to compet@@ e in ?
&quot; the tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture should be 25 degre@@ es .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t mind low w@@ in@@ ds , as long as they sta@@ y the same . &quot;
experienc@@ ed former government official critic@@ ised politicians for Y@@ le : &quot; we have nothing to distribu@@ te , now or in many years to come &quot;
E@@ r@@ k@@ ki V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en , an experienc@@ ed government official who prepared bud@@ gets in the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance for dec@@ ad@@ es war@@ ns that , despite the positive economic at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here , the Government of Prime Minister J@@ uh@@ a S@@ ip@@ il@@ ä must keep its co@@ ol and be careful not to increase the state budget with bor@@ ro@@ wed money .

V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en regards the recent proposals of politicians for increasing the standard pension , dec@@ reas@@ ing c@@ ar taxes and supporting elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ik@@ es as election r@@ het@@ or@@ ic .
they mainly indic@@ ate that elections are appro@@ ac@@ hing . after all , as ten per cent of the state budget is fund@@ ed by bor@@ ro@@ wing more money , there is nothing to distribu@@ te , now or in many years to come .
V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en told Y@@ le that it is ne@@ arly a dec@@ ep@@ tion to talk about distribu@@ table funds when they are bor@@ ro@@ wed .
he emphas@@ ised that all money bor@@ ro@@ wed is something our children have to pay back .
V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en has a long history in preparing state bud@@ gets : he started working in the Minis@@ try of Fin@@ ance in 197@@ 8 as a budget secre@@ tary , and worked since as a de@@ pu@@ ty manag@@ er of the budget de@@ part@@ ment and as a budget manag@@ er .
before his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , he worked as the permanent secre@@ tary of the Minis@@ try of Economic Affairs and Employment .
in the Y@@ le inter@@ view , V@@ ir@@ tan@@ en pointed out that the estima@@ ted economic growth of three per cent will probably be temporary .
all econom@@ ists estima@@ te that his is only a sp@@ ik@@ e , followed by a do@@ w@@ n@@ ward tr@@ end next year , and Fin@@ land must expect growth of one per cent for dec@@ ad@@ es .

the Danish Ro@@ y@@ al Court said that Qu@@ een Mar@@ gre@@ the of Denmark , 7@@ 7 , and her sp@@ ouse P@@ rin@@ ce H@@ en@@ ri@@ k , 8@@ 3 , will not be bu@@ ried next to each other .

a moment of hor@@ ro@@ r on the road : ne@@ arly h@@ it by a c@@ ar on the hi@@ gh@@ way
T@@ om@@ mi was dri@@ ving with his sp@@ ouse and their two small children .
lu@@ c@@ kil@@ y , they did not get h@@ ur@@ t in the accident , but they will not receive any insurance compensation , unless the coun@@ ter@@ party can be reached .
the inc@@ ident took place ne@@ ar K@@ e@@ im@@ ol@@ an@@ por@@ t@@ ti in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a .
ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve p@@ ho@@ to from R@@ ing Ro@@ ad I@@ II ro@@ ad@@ work sit@@ e .
T@@ om@@ mi from V@@ an@@ ta@@ a says it was a mi@@ rac@@ le that their family sur@@ vi@@ ved the c@@ ar accident on Tu@@ es@@ day .
T@@ om@@ mi , his sp@@ ouse Ri@@ ina and their two small children were dri@@ ving on the hi@@ gh@@ way ne@@ ar K@@ e@@ im@@ ol@@ an@@ por@@ t@@ ti in V@@ an@@ ta@@ a towards H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ l@@ inn@@ a .
T@@ om@@ mi says that a wh@@ ite c@@ ar was spe@@ eding up on the R@@ ing Ro@@ ad I@@ II j@@ unc@@ tion about to enter the hi@@ gh@@ way when it ne@@ arly h@@ it the side of their c@@ ar .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , the wh@@ ite c@@ ar would have h@@ it them if T@@ om@@ mi had not been able to s@@ w@@ er@@ ve to the left .
&quot; I h@@ it the b@@ ra@@ kes and s@@ w@@ er@@ ved to the left at the same time - and then I lost control of the c@@ ar , &quot; T@@ om@@ mi says .
the family &apos;s c@@ ar h@@ it the med@@ ian bar@@ ri@@ er at high speed .
the par@@ ents and their two children sitting in the back se@@ at did not get h@@ ur@@ t .
one of the children is almost three years old , and the other is under 12 months of age .
&quot; we were really lu@@ ck@@ y not to get h@@ ur@@ t .
there were no c@@ ars heading our way , even though the place is us@@ u@@ ally very bus@@ y . &quot;
the accident took place at 5 : 20 p@@ m .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , no c@@ ar sto@@ pped to help them , and the family called 1@@ 12 .
they were able to get out of the c@@ ar without help .
an amb@@ ul@@ ance and res@@ c@@ ue person@@ nel arri@@ ved on sit@@ e to chec@@ k the condition of the family members .
the c@@ ar was dama@@ ged beyond re@@ pa@@ ir .
T@@ om@@ mi says that he and her sp@@ ouse have a low income and their respective families ch@@ ip@@ p@@ ed in to help them bu@@ y the c@@ ar .
according to T@@ om@@ mi , they will not receive any insurance compensation , unless they obtain the details of the other c@@ ar .
this is why the family hop@@ es that anyone who wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the accident come for@@ th and report any information about the other c@@ ar .
&quot; we need a c@@ ar every single day .
we can &apos;@@ t take our children to the da@@ y@@ -@@ care centre or go to work without it , &quot; T@@ om@@ mi says .
T@@ om@@ mi saw that the other c@@ ar was wh@@ ite and a little ol@@ der ,
probably from the late 199@@ 0@@ s or early 200@@ 0@@ s .
he thin@@ ks that the regis@@ tra@@ tion number started with S@@ I@@ G .
&quot; if the coun@@ ter@@ party cannot be ap@@ prehen@@ ded , I d@@ on &apos;@@ t know how we can sur@@ vi@@ ve finan@@ ci@@ ally - we are already in a situation where we need to coun@@ t every p@@ enn@@ y . &quot;
T@@ om@@ mi hop@@ es that anyone who wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the accident or knows something about it contac@@ ts the police .
persons contac@@ ted from the I@@ t@@ ä@@ -@@ U@@ u@@ si@@ ma@@ a police de@@ part@@ ment and the K@@ es@@ ki@@ -@@ U@@ u@@ si@@ ma@@ a res@@ c@@ ue de@@ part@@ ment confirm that they were at the accident sit@@ e on Tu@@ es@@ day evening .
the head@@ line and ar@@ ticle were revis@@ ed at 9 : 15 p@@ m : un@@ like origin@@ ally re@@ ported , the other c@@ ar did not dri@@ ve the other way , but ne@@ arly h@@ it the family &apos;s c@@ ar when enter@@ ing the hi@@ gh@@ way from a j@@ unc@@ tion .

do we play a certain role or do we approach others open@@ ly ?
the pl@@ ot@@ less show is a mi@@ x of fact and fic@@ tion .
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen has both direc@@ ted the show and adap@@ ted it for the stage .
she is also in charge of li@@ ghting .
the show consis@@ ts of texts written by the working group , and there is no plo@@ t .
the direc@@ tor believes that , even though the show gets its ins@@ pi@@ ration from young people &apos;s thou@@ ghts , it spea@@ ks to people of all ages .
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen emphas@@ ises that I@@ ten@@ s@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja does not express her own relation@@ ships or those of the working group .
&quot; it &apos;s a mi@@ x of fact and fic@@ tion .
I &apos;@@ m sure my values come through from the show .
I &apos;@@ m not thinking that human relations are bad , but I d@@ on &apos;@@ t think either that a relationship , especially an inti@@ ma@@ te relationship , is the only key to happ@@ in@@ ess . &quot;
many learn from their div@@ or@@ ced par@@ ents
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen thin@@ ks that I@@ t@@ sens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja dra@@ ws a top@@ ical pic@@ ture of young ad@@ ul@@ ts living in 1@@ 00@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old Fin@@ land .
she says that many have lear@@ ned about relation@@ ships from their par@@ ents , many of whom are div@@ or@@ ced -
at least that it is important to lis@@ ten to y@@ our@@ self .
there is no need to sta@@ y in a relationship that does not work .
the show is per@@ for@@ med by M@@ ine@@ a L@@ å@@ n@@ g , N@@ ik@@ la@@ s R@@ au@@ t@@ é@@ n and O@@ t@@ to R@@ ok@@ ka .
C@@ os@@ tu@@ mi@@ er E@@ lla S@@ nell@@ man is also part of the working group .
mu@@ si@@ c has been ar@@ ran@@ ged by J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen and R@@ ok@@ ka .
lo@@ ve for the the@@ at@@ re ig@@ ni@@ ted in K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a
L@@ o@@ t@@ ta J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen , 26 , from K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a is stud@@ ying at the Ar@@ ts Ac@@ ad@@ em@@ y of Tur@@ k@@ u Uni@@ versity of applied S@@ ci@@ ences to become a direc@@ tor of the@@ at@@ r@@ ical per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
after two years , she has reached the hal@@ f@@ way point of her studies .
J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen fel@@ l in lo@@ ve with the the@@ at@@ re during her years in K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a .
speci@@ alis@@ ing in mu@@ si@@ c during her scho@@ ol years , she has worked as an assis@@ tant at K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a T@@ he@@ at@@ re and ac@@ ted , for example , at Y@@ li@@ op@@ pil@@ as@@ te@@ at@@ ter@@ i stud@@ ent the@@ at@@ re in Hel@@ sin@@ ki and , most recently , at L@@ in@@ na@@ te@@ at@@ ter@@ i the@@ at@@ re in Tur@@ k@@ u .
her interest in direc@@ ting has increased ste@@ ad@@ ily .
I@@ t@@ sens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja pre@@ mi@@ ered last week at N@@ ar@@ r@@ in n@@ ä@@ yt@@ t@@ ä@@ m@@ ö in Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
the 4@@ 5@@ -@@ minu@@ te show will most likely be also per@@ for@@ med in Tur@@ k@@ u where J@@ ä@@ pp@@ inen is stud@@ ying .
I@@ t@@ sens@@ ä@@ pal@@ j@@ as@@ te@@ li@@ ja at M@@ ik@@ ä ? the@@ at@@ re in K@@ ou@@ vol@@ a on 4 A@@ ug@@ ust at 7 p@@ m and on 5 A@@ ug@@ ust at 2 p@@ m and 7 p@@ m .
F@@ inn@@ ish Ol@@ ymp@@ ic w@@ inn@@ er took one year to rec@@ over from a terri@@ ble mo@@ to@@ cross accident - cer@@ v@@ ical sp@@ ine f@@ rac@@ tu@@ red
not many F@@ inn@@ ish a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are the un@@ sto@@ p@@ pa@@ ble force of nature that is J@@ ann@@ e La@@ h@@ tel@@ a .
the sta@@ r mo@@ gu@@ l s@@ ki@@ er tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed around the world hund@@ re@@ ds of days for twenty years and ch@@ ased his dre@@ am of w@@ inning the Ol@@ ymp@@ ic g@@ old med@@ al .
the dre@@ am came true in 2002 , but La@@ h@@ tel@@ a kept going .
he was not only ti@@ re@@ less in training , but also eag@@ er to try new s@@ ports .
there are not many s@@ ports above ground K@@ em@@ i@@ j@@ ä@@ r@@ vi@@ -@@ based La@@ h@@ tel@@ a has not tried at least once .
&quot; it has help@@ ed me not to stop .
there &apos;s always something new , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
in the end , one sport ne@@ arly sto@@ pped La@@ h@@ tel@@ a for good .
in 20@@ 14 , he was in a mo@@ to@@ cross accident ,
where he suffer@@ ed a cer@@ v@@ ical f@@ rac@@ ture and bro@@ ke both of his arms .
&quot; I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t work any@@ where .
I lic@@ ked my w@@ oun@@ ds at home for a year , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
there was also bad lu@@ ck involved .
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a also ad@@ m@@ its that his age might have had something to do with the accident .
&quot; rid@@ ing a mo@@ to@@ cross b@@ ik@@ e may seem w@@ il@@ d .
but I w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t trying to find any limits .
it &apos;s just such a tou@@ gh sport that it &apos;s too much for a for@@ ty year old like me ! &quot;
after the accident , La@@ h@@ tel@@ a was in an un@@ us@@ ual situation .
his active life came to a full stop .
he had recently re@@ turned from a long s@@ tin@@ t as the head co@@ ach of the national fre@@ esty@@ le te@@ am of Jap@@ an .
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a started in this position immediately after his care@@ er en@@ ded in 2006 .
&quot; I had to sta@@ y still for the first time since I turned 15 .
I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t really do anything , &quot; says La@@ h@@ tel@@ a .
when he worked as a co@@ ach , La@@ h@@ tel@@ a often challeng@@ ed his a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in the s@@ lop@@ es and p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal condition tes@@ ts .
&quot; surpris@@ ingly , having to stop was a positive experience .
I was so ti@@ red , both men@@ tally and p@@ hy@@ si@@ cally , that even my own thou@@ ghts d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t seem ra@@ tional ,
not even those related to the sport .
it felt good to just stop .
I actually enjo@@ yed that I d@@ id@@ n &apos;@@ t have to do anything . &quot;
the forced break ins@@ pi@@ red La@@ h@@ tel@@ a to start as the head co@@ ach of T@@ e@@ am Fin@@ land .
if he had not had to stop , he might have bur@@ n@@ t out .
&quot; it &apos;s easier to find parts of my body that have been bro@@ ken than those that have remain@@ ed in@@ tac@@ t !
without the accident , I W@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t have realis@@ ed that I needed so much rest . &quot;
La@@ h@@ tel@@ a started as the head co@@ ach of the national fre@@ esty@@ le te@@ am of Fin@@ land a year ago .
at the same time , he found a saf@@ er ho@@ b@@ by to re@@ place hi@@ gh@@ -@@ speed s@@ ports .
&quot; I re@@ placed mo@@ to@@ cross with dis@@ c g@@ ol@@ f !
it all got out of hand right away .
at wor@@ st , I spent s@@ even hours a day th@@ ro@@ wing . &quot;
even though La@@ h@@ tel@@ a has always worked hard , he does not demand similar commitment from his a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
&quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to force everyone to be the same .
in our culture , there is room to be y@@ our@@ self and there are many ways to become the best in the world .
as indicated by its name , fre@@ esty@@ le has always been about a free sty@@ le and men@@ tal@@ ity , &quot; La@@ h@@ tel@@ a says .
the rise of se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts is real , and we should be concerned
just when you thought 20@@ 17 cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;@@ t get any we@@ ir@@ der along comes a new report on the technolog@@ ical developments in the se@@ x ro@@ b@@ ot sector .
Y@@ ep .
se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts are a big deal right now .
recently , the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for Res@@ pon@@ sible R@@ ob@@ o@@ tics ( F@@ R@@ R ) rele@@ ased a report looking at the development of se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts over the next five to 10 years .
according to N@@ o@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ it@@ us prof@@ ess@@ or of ro@@ bo@@ tics and arti@@ fic@@ ial intell@@ ig@@ ence at the Uni@@ versity of S@@ he@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co@@ -@@ foun@@ der of the F@@ R@@ R , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
custom@@ ers can choose the ro@@ b@@ ot &apos;s e@@ ye col@@ our , ni@@ p@@ ple sha@@ pe and fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il type .
&quot; people s@@ ni@@ gg@@ er about them , but the companies are actually ship@@ ping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more , &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said at the laun@@ ch of the new report .
modern se@@ x doll@@ s have ev@@ ol@@ ved out of their blo@@ w@@ -@@ up coun@@ ter@@ parts into ro@@ bo@@ ts with a sil@@ ic@@ on s@@ kin that is war@@ m to the tou@@ ch - with deliber@@ ately human@@ -@@ like respon@@ ses achieved by arti@@ fic@@ ial intell@@ ig@@ ence .
the us@@ er can also &quot; custom@@ ise &quot; their ro@@ b@@ ot to su@@ it their per@@ su@@ asi@@ ons , cho@@ os@@ ing everything from the ro@@ b@@ ot &apos;s e@@ ye col@@ our , ni@@ p@@ ple sha@@ pe to fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il type or col@@ our .
but it gets even more d@@ istu@@ r@@ b@@ ing , with many of the ro@@ bo@@ ts pos@@ s@@ essing &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would make a S@@ te@@ p@@ for@@ d wi@@ f@@ e look prog@@ res@@ sive .
modern se@@ x doll@@ s have ev@@ ol@@ ved into ro@@ bo@@ ts with a sil@@ ic@@ on s@@ kin .
the Re@@ al@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x ro@@ b@@ ot , for example , allows users to custom@@ ise their ro@@ bo@@ ts according to the tra@@ its they find appe@@ al@@ ing , such as s@@ hy@@ ness .
then there are the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y G@@ old se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts , developed by true compan@@ ion , which come with pre@@ -@@ program@@ med person@@ alities , including &quot; F@@ ri@@ gi@@ d F@@ ar@@ ra@@ h &quot; that gives the impression of s@@ hy@@ ness and &quot; W@@ il@@ d W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us &quot; person@@ ality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y G@@ old has a person@@ ality which is mat@@ ched as much as possible to your person@@ ality , &quot; the true compan@@ ion we@@ b@@ sit@@ e en@@ th@@ uses .
so she lik@@ es what you like , dis@@ lik@@ es what you dis@@ like , et@@ c .
she also has mo@@ ods during the day just like real people !
she can be s@@ le@@ ep@@ y , conver@@ sa@@ tional or she can &apos; be in the mo@@ od &apos; ! &quot;
there are many d@@ istu@@ r@@ b@@ ing aspects to the rise of se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts - not least of which is the re@@ pla@@ cement of real , human relation@@ ships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent f@@ em@@ ale tra@@ its , the ra@@ pe@@ y con@@ no@@ tations of making a move on F@@ ri@@ gi@@ d ( read : res@@ is@@ tant ) F@@ ar@@ ra@@ h , are the most concerning .
on its we@@ b@@ sit@@ e , true compan@@ ion lik@@ ened Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y to a vi@@ b@@ ra@@ tor , but for men .
&quot; if w@@ oman ( si@@ c ) can have a vi@@ b@@ ra@@ tor , why can &apos;@@ t men have a Ro@@ x@@ x@@ x@@ y ? &quot; the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e states .
however , these se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts are not a m@@ ere f@@ et@@ ish or just another se@@ x to@@ y .
their emerg@@ ence and increasing sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ation points to something d@@ ar@@ ker and deep@@ er within our culture , a re@@ tre@@ at from the ide@@ al of gender equality to@@ ward a desire for se@@ x with sub@@ j@@ ug@@ ation as an op@@ tional add@@ -@@ on .
most men , naturally , are not going to keep se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts , and while the F@@ R@@ R noted their increasing pop@@ ul@@ arity , they remain , for now , on the out@@ s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts of consumer culture .
but what se@@ ep@@ s in from the f@@ r@@ ing@@ es can be highly ins@@ truc@@ tive as to the ten@@ or of the er@@ a we &apos;@@ re living in .
and many people ar@@ en &apos;@@ t we@@ ir@@ d or off@@ ensi@@ ve until the free market gives them the per@@ mission to be so .
there is little co@@ inc@@ idence that these sop@@ his@@ tic@@ ated se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts have emer@@ ged at a time when women &apos;s rights are under threat across the g@@ lo@@ be , when there is a presid@@ ent in the White House who has b@@ ra@@ g@@ ged about sex@@ u@@ ally assa@@ ul@@ ting women .
the most ch@@ ill@@ ing aspect of the T@@ V series The H@@ and@@ ma@@ id &apos;s ta@@ le is@@ n &apos;@@ t the gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c imag@@ ery , the no@@ os@@ ed bodies and g@@ ou@@ ged e@@ yes , but just how realistic that vision fe@@ els .
the Republic of G@@ ile@@ ad is a lea@@ p , but , right now , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t feel like a large one .
the aim behind these se@@ x ro@@ bo@@ ts is to create as much of a p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal lik@@ eness to actual women ( al@@ be@@ it with por@@ n sta@@ r propor@@ tions ) as technolog@@ ically possible .
their cre@@ ators want them to feel human to the tou@@ ch , for them to m@@ im@@ ic the movement of a real body .
but , poin@@ tedly , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the ro@@ bo@@ ts do not represent real women .
they cannot break up with their compan@@ ion , or w@@ al@@ k out .
they have no agency or back@@ -@@ s@@ tory , nothing to suggest independence or anything that may dis@@ rup@@ t the f@@ an@@ tas@@ y of total ser@@ v@@ it@@ ude .
they are ple@@ as@@ ant s@@ la@@ ves , in other words .
or to put it into 20@@ 17 par@@ l@@ ance : hand@@ ma@@ id@@ ens .
police sus@@ pects : two terrorist acts were planned in Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia by group led by I@@ S@@ I@@ S lead@@ er
a lead@@ er of the terrorist organisation I@@ S@@ I@@ S led a group of Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ian men who are sus@@ pec@@ ted of planning to take a bom@@ b on board an E@@ ti@@ had A@@ ir@@ ways plan@@ e .
S@@ yd@@ ne@@ y Mor@@ ning Her@@ al@@ d reports that one of the leaders of I@@ S@@ I@@ S had also sent parts of a bom@@ b to S@@ yd@@ ne@@ y .
according to the sus@@ pects , their intention was to pl@@ ant the bom@@ b on the plan@@ e on 15 July , but their attempt failed before the security chec@@ k@@ point .
the police have not dis@@ closed any details of why the attempt failed .
another plan of the sus@@ pec@@ ted terroris@@ ts was to build a ma@@ ch@@ ine that s@@ pre@@ ads a col@@ our@@ less to@@ x@@ ic gas which they would set off in a place full of people , such as a public transport vehic@@ le .
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ hel@@ an , a de@@ pu@@ ty com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er of the Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ian F@@ eder@@ al Pol@@ ice , says that this was one of the most professional plans ever wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia .
due to the plans of sus@@ pec@@ ted terroris@@ ts , four men were ap@@ prehen@@ ded in police ra@@ id@@ s on Sa@@ tur@@ day .
one of the men has been rele@@ ased , but his inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations will also be continued later .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s great fe@@ at ?
making M@@ it@@ t R@@ om@@ ne@@ y seem the e@@ pit@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the tr@@ um@@ p er@@ a that the political div@@ isions that have pol@@ ar@@ ised the US elec@@ tor@@ ate have , on a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ -@@ scale , tor@@ n families apart .
around Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas and T@@ han@@ ks@@ giving , new@@ s@@ paper@@ s in the US ab@@ oun@@ ded with advice c@@ olu@@ m@@ ns on how to deal with the hor@@ ro@@ r of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ -@@ voting rela@@ tives .
we are all sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly stra@@ in@@ ing to bur@@ st our fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ b@@ les .
less remar@@ ked on is the power of tr@@ um@@ p to bring families together .
I mention this because my cou@@ s@@ in , a le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ le@@ an@@ ing po@@ et who lives in Ch@@ ic@@ ago and who &apos;s long been at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ head@@ s with Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , has been vis@@ iting me in New Yor@@ k this week .
she remin@@ ded me that un@@ ity against a common enem@@ y can have a power@@ ful effect .
with tr@@ um@@ p in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an si@@ b@@ ling she had been b@@ ic@@ ker@@ ing with about politics for dec@@ ad@@ es , is su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and pec@@ u@@ li@@ arly on the same side .
around the d@@ inn@@ er table this is surely a good thing ; but it strik@@ es me that , in a broad@@ er context , it car@@ ries significant risks .
the left has been invi@@ g@@ or@@ ated by tr@@ um@@ p , but the war@@ ping effect of his presidency has the power to pus@@ h us all ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ards .
when we talk about &quot; nor@@ m@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ um@@ p , we are referring to the sc@@ ary possibility that his an@@ tics may one day ce@@ ase to app@@ al .
there is an even sc@@ ar@@ i@@ er l@@ ong@@ -@@ range sc@@ en@@ ar@@ io , however , in which what tr@@ um@@ p &quot; nor@@ m@@ alis@@ es &quot; are ri@@ gh@@ tw@@ ing Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans who , held up against his standards , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly seem the e@@ pit@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself acti@@ vely nos@@ tal@@ gic these days for M@@ it@@ t R@@ om@@ ne@@ y &apos;s qu@@ ain@@ t version of cra@@ z@@ y - the do@@ g on the c@@ ar ro@@ of , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we k@@ new what his tax return lo@@ ok@@ ed like ) - both of which , compared to tr@@ um@@ p , seem very mil@@ d off@@ ences indeed .
when tr@@ um@@ p goes , the next Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an candidate will merely have to be san@@ e to quali@@ fy as an im@@ me@@ as@@ ura@@ ble improvement .
while my cou@@ s@@ in was in to@@ wn , we took our kid@@ s to the car@@ ou@@ se@@ l in Central Par@@ k , the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est of the car@@ ou@@ sel@@ s run by the New Yor@@ k par@@ ks de@@ part@@ ment , and the best three b@@ uc@@ ks you can spen@@ d in the c@@ ity if you d@@ on &apos;@@ t require ca@@ ff@@ e@@ ine .
the hor@@ ses are th@@ under@@ ously huge , the fi@@ bre@@ -@@ g@@ las@@ s desig@@ ns on the central cy@@ lin@@ der - all g@@ ur@@ ning c@@ low@@ ns and animals tw@@ is@@ ting to look over their own sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders in terro@@ r - ut@@ ter@@ ly sin@@ is@@ ter , and the tin@@ kl@@ ing mu@@ si@@ c od@@ dly trans@@ porting .
so many of the cl@@ ic@@ hes of a c@@ ity disap@@ point : views from tal@@ l buil@@ dings get old , s@@ ky@@ lines gro@@ w too fam@@ ili@@ ar to offer much of a th@@ r@@ ill , and the reality of the c@@ ity do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t live up to the dre@@ am .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ five years later and I &apos;@@ m still not entirely over the day I dis@@ covered Sw@@ is@@ s co@@ tta@@ ge is not , in fact , a Sw@@ is@@ s co@@ tta@@ ge - the them@@ e pu@@ b , Y@@ e Ol@@ de Sw@@ is@@ s co@@ tta@@ ge , do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t coun@@ t - but a large ro@@ und@@ about in nor@@ th L@@ on@@ d@@ on .
the Central Par@@ k car@@ ou@@ se@@ l , however , is still a we@@ ir@@ dly ma@@ g@@ ical experience , to the extent that two tw@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , an 11@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old and two women in their 4@@ 0@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ou@@ se@@ l I would have given it full mar@@ ks , but than@@ k@@ fully no@@ body asked .
in a de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e this week , on the other hand , I was required , before s@@ wi@@ ping my cre@@ dit c@@ ard , to rate my transa@@ c@@ tional &quot; experience &quot; on a scale of one to five star@@ s .
in the co@@ ff@@ ee sho@@ p at the cor@@ ner of my stre@@ et it &apos;s the same thing , plu@@ s the option to mat@@ ch the ra@@ ting with a 15 % ti@@ p - this for bu@@ ying something over the counter .
the effect of this is not only to s@@ low down what should be a neu@@ tra@@ l exchange , but to put pressure on the ser@@ ver to in@@ ject person@@ ality into a situation where n@@ one is required .
the poor w@@ oman in the de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e stood gr@@ inning a@@ pol@@ og@@ e@@ tically while , we@@ arily , I gave the experience of han@@ ding her my cre@@ dit c@@ ard five star@@ s .

prosecu@@ tors have announced their intention to appeal again , this time against P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us &apos; si@@ x@@ -@@ year sen@@ tence , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the N@@ ational prosecu@@ ting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa &apos;s Su@@ pre@@ me Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .
P@@ is@@ tor@@ i@@ us fac@@ es having his sen@@ tence increased to 15 years if prosecu@@ tors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

cell@@ s that are capable of tri@@ gg@@ ering inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation are balanced by cell@@ s that promote toler@@ ance , protecting the body without dama@@ ging sensitive t@@ issues .
when the balance til@@ ts too far to@@ ward inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation , inf@@ la@@ m@@ ma@@ tory b@@ ow@@ el disease can result .
in exper@@ im@@ ents it was found a kind of toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting im@@ mu@@ ne cel@@ l appears in m@@ ice that carry a specific bac@@ teri@@ um in their gu@@ ts .
and the bac@@ teri@@ um needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building b@@ loc@@ ks of prote@@ ins - to tri@@ gg@@ er the cell@@ s &apos; appe@@ ar@@ ance .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or C@@ ol@@ onn@@ a said : &apos; we established a link between one bac@@ teri@@ al spec@@ ies - L@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ u@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the g@@ ut m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cell@@ s that promote toler@@ ance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the m@@ ice had in their di@@ et , the more of these im@@ mu@@ ne cell@@ s they had . &apos;

she sus@@ pec@@ ted the difference had to do with the m@@ ice &apos;s g@@ ut m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ om@@ es - the community of bac@@ teri@@ a , vir@@ uses and f@@ un@@ g@@ i that nor@@ m@@ ally live within the g@@ as@@ tro@@ inte@@ s@@ tin@@ al trac@@ t .
the gu@@ ts of the m@@ ice were D@@ N@@ A sequ@@ enc@@ ed and it was found six bac@@ teri@@ al spec@@ ies present in the m@@ ice with the im@@ mu@@ ne cell@@ s but ab@@ sent from the m@@ ice without them .
m@@ ice re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so they la@@ c@@ ked a g@@ ut m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome and do not develop this kind of im@@ mu@@ ne cel@@ l were given l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i and the im@@ mu@@ ne cell@@ s ar@@ ose .
to understand how the bac@@ teri@@ a affected the im@@ mu@@ ne system , the res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers gre@@ w l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in li@@ qu@@ id and then trans@@ fer@@ red small amounts of the li@@ qu@@ id - without bac@@ teri@@ a - to im@@ ma@@ ture im@@ mu@@ ne cell@@ s is@@ ol@@ ated from m@@ ice .
the im@@ mu@@ ne cell@@ s developed into the toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting cell@@ s .
when the active com@@ pon@@ ent was pu@@ ri@@ fied from the li@@ qu@@ id , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han me@@ tab@@ ol@@ ism known as ind@@ ole@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id .
when the res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers doub@@ led the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the m@@ ice &apos;s feed , the number of such cell@@ s ro@@ se by about 50 perc@@ ent but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cell@@ s dro@@ pped by half .
D@@ r C@@ er@@ van@@ tes@@ -@@ Bar@@ ra@@ g@@ an expla@@ ined people have the same toler@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ promoting cell@@ s as m@@ ice , and most of us sh@@ el@@ ter l@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ as@@ tro@@ inte@@ s@@ tin@@ al trac@@ ts .

White House pro@@ p cost tax@@ pay@@ ers Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds
the White House &apos;s decision to f@@ ly a Mar@@ ine hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to the South la@@ wn for an event highli@@ ghting American manufac@@ turing last month cost tax@@ pay@@ ers as much as $ 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 000 , according to military rec@@ or@@ ds rele@@ ased to time .
the gre@@ en@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ wh@@ ite S@@ ik@@ or@@ s@@ ky V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D , known as Mar@@ ine O@@ ne when the President is ab@@ o@@ ard , was the c@@ enter@@ pi@@ ece of the July 17 event at the White House show@@ cas@@ ing American construction pro@@ gra@@ ms .
President D@@ on@@ al@@ d tr@@ um@@ p , V@@ ice President M@@ ik@@ e p@@ ence and sen@@ i@@ or White House officials tou@@ red manufac@@ turing products from all 50 states .
the C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut@@ -@@ made hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter was dis@@ played al@@ ong@@ side a y@@ ac@@ h@@ t from M@@ ain@@ e , a fir@@ e truc@@ k from W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in , and a for@@ k@@ li@@ ft from M@@ is@@ sis@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
the White House M@@ ili@@ tary Office requested the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter &apos;s presence in a fra@@ g@@ mentary order , or F@@ R@@ A@@ G@@ O , bar@@ ely 36 hours before the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter lan@@ ded on the South la@@ wn for the &quot; un@@ us@@ ual &quot; event , according to the rec@@ or@@ ds of Mar@@ ine hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter s@@ qu@@ ad@@ ron O@@ ne ( H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 ) , the uni@@ t responsible for operating the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it &apos;s such an un@@ us@@ ual high visi@@ bility event , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der of H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 em@@ a@@ iled his su@@ peri@@ or , the Mar@@ ine D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant for A@@ vi@@ ation , the day before the event .
the message indicated the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter would arri@@ ve on the South la@@ wn at appro@@ xim@@ ately 7 a@@ .@@ m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event , and remain until the la@@ wn was cle@@ ared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening .
the note ad@@ ds that should the de@@ par@@ ture from the White House be dela@@ yed , a second air@@ cre@@ w would be needed for the return f@@ light due to du@@ ty@@ -@@ h@@ our restrictions .
the original f@@ light cre@@ w was with the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter during the event , while uni@@ t security person@@ nel remain@@ ed with the air@@ craft while it was the ground .
it was not clear from rec@@ or@@ ds provided to time whether a second f@@ light cre@@ w was ultimately required .
the ha@@ t@@ ch Ac@@ t prohi@@ b@@ its feder@@ al employees from using government proper@@ ty for political purposes .
rec@@ or@@ ds indic@@ ate that H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 in@@ qu@@ ired about whether the event might viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; one question we asked was if it was a viol@@ ation of the ha@@ t@@ ch Ac@@ t and were informed it was not , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der w@@ ro@@ te .
&quot; s@@ oun@@ ds like you are loc@@ ked , &quot; the D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant re@@ pli@@ ed .
the &quot; made in America &quot; event was desig@@ na@@ ted an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the ha@@ t@@ ch Ac@@ t .
but even official events have political over@@ ton@@ es .
at the event , the President made a pus@@ h for heal@@ th@@ care reform efforts then under@@ way in the S@@ en@@ ate and tou@@ ted efforts to re@@ in in government regulations .
using the air@@ craft known as Mar@@ ine O@@ ne or A@@ ir For@@ ce O@@ ne for politically advanta@@ ge@@ ous purposes is har@@ dly a new phen@@ omen@@ on .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
but requ@@ is@@ ition@@ ing their use sol@@ ely for a p@@ ho@@ to@@ -@@ o@@ p is un@@ us@@ ual .
tr@@ um@@ p dre@@ w scru@@ tin@@ y in February when the presid@@ ential air@@ plan@@ e ta@@ xi@@ ed to the back@@ dro@@ p of his first campaign r@@ ally in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , F@@ l@@ a . , and his T@@ wit@@ ter account is f@@ l@@ us@@ h with messa@@ ges compla@@ in@@ ing about his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or &apos;s use of the presid@@ ential air@@ craft .
&quot; the White House is th@@ ri@@ ll@@ ed with the &apos; made I@@ n America &apos; show@@ case that fe@@ atu@@ red products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materi@@ als , &quot; said White House de@@ pu@@ ty press secre@@ tary L@@ ind@@ say W@@ al@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 cre@@ ws frequ@@ ently per@@ form training f@@ li@@ ghts around the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton area and at the South la@@ wn to practice de@@ pos@@ iting the President of the United States at the White House with in@@ ches of prec@@ ision .
when tr@@ um@@ p was at the G@@ -@@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 conduc@@ ted 5@@ 8 practice lan@@ dings at the White House .
the f@@ light for the made in America event coun@@ ted to@@ ward the air@@ cre@@ w &apos;s training requirement for the month , an official said .
uni@@ t hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters also fle@@ w an additional 11 hours that day for &quot; n@@ on@@ -@@ presid@@ ential support mis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said tax@@ pay@@ ers did not pic@@ k up the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps fe@@ atu@@ red at the event .
a spo@@ kes@@ person for S@@ ik@@ or@@ s@@ ky said the company was not involved in arrang@@ ing for the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to be dis@@ played on the South la@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 do@@ es@@ n &apos;@@ t maintain budgetary rec@@ or@@ ds for presid@@ ential f@@ li@@ ghts , and determin@@ ing the precise cost inc@@ ur@@ red by the event is difficult .
but according to D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se h@@ our@@ ly rates for fis@@ cal year 20@@ 17 , the D@@ o@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement rate for the V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D is $ 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 80 per f@@ light h@@ our .
uni@@ t rec@@ or@@ ds record the air@@ craft f@@ light time as 30 minu@@ tes each way from its home base at Mar@@ ine Cor@@ ps A@@ ir F@@ ac@@ ility Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
the White House argu@@ es the true cost of operating the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter is well bel@@ ow that rate .
&quot; to place a cost to tax@@ pay@@ ers based on the re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement rate estima@@ tes is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; W@@ al@@ ters said .
&quot; these rate estima@@ tes include person@@ nel , main@@ ten@@ ance and many other su@@ n@@ k costs that are included in annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a 20@@ 15 r@@ and study , D@@ o@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement rates do not include the cost of person@@ nel , but do account for fu@@ el , main@@ ten@@ ance , and contrac@@ ting costs .
at the time , former White House press secre@@ tary S@@ ean S@@ pic@@ er def@@ en@@ ded the use of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to show@@ case this week things that are made in America , &quot; S@@ pic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ s@@ ky and the state of C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut are very pro@@ ud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , I assume , hund@@ re@@ ds if not thousands of people whose job depen@@ ds on that .
and I think , like most Americ@@ ans , we &apos;@@ re all pro@@ ud of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americ@@ ans worked ti@@ re@@ less@@ ly to do .
so , of course , it &apos;s appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it w@@ as@@ n &apos;@@ t clear whether tr@@ um@@ p inte@@ rac@@ ted with the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter as he tou@@ red the South la@@ wn for the event , but he did step into the dri@@ ver &apos;s se@@ at of a fir@@ e truc@@ k .
in@@ side the White House , tr@@ um@@ p addressed S@@ ik@@ or@@ s@@ ky representatives , jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ s@@ ky very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

Pro@@ secu@@ tor General of V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a demands justice when ap@@ poin@@ ting new deleg@@ ates
the Pro@@ secu@@ tor General of V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a has applied for a court order to prevent the new deleg@@ ates from being ap@@ pointed .
N@@ ic@@ ol@@ as Mad@@ uro , President of V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a , has announced that the new deleg@@ ates elected through last S@@ und@@ ay &apos;s elections will be ap@@ pointed on F@@ rid@@ ay .
as a result of the contro@@ versi@@ al elections , V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a received new deleg@@ ates who are author@@ ised , for example , to a@@ mend the nation &apos;s constitution .
according to Pro@@ secu@@ tor General Lu@@ isa Or@@ teg@@ a , the decision to prevent the ap@@ poin@@ tment was deman@@ ded due to sus@@ pic@@ ions that the elections were ri@@ g@@ ged .
Or@@ teg@@ a has also laun@@ ched investig@@ ations for the all@@ eg@@ ed@@ ly ri@@ g@@ ged elections .
she ap@@ pointed two jud@@ ges after the British company that organised the elections announced that the results had been man@@ ipu@@ lated .
according to the company , the number of vo@@ ters re@@ ported by V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ an officials is higher than the number of actual vo@@ ters by appro@@ xim@@ ately one million .
only Mad@@ uro &apos;s all@@ ies ran for the constitu@@ ent ass@@ embly , and the 5@@ 45 deleg@@ ates elected include , for example , Mad@@ uro &apos;s wi@@ f@@ e and son .
in addition to a@@ mending the constitution , the deleg@@ ates are author@@ ised to dis@@ solve the oppos@@ ition@@ -@@ led con@@ g@@ ress and a@@ mend laws .
Mad@@ uro described as a dicta@@ tor
Mad@@ uro &apos;s actions have been critic@@ ised exten@@ sively .
the opposition regards the attemp@@ ts to a@@ mend the constitution as a way for Mad@@ uro to strengthen his position .
the United States has imposed sanctions on Mad@@ uro and called him a dicta@@ tor .
the EU , the UK , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia and Ar@@ gent@@ ina have announced that they will not recognise the new deleg@@ ates .
Mad@@ uro claim@@ s that the new deleg@@ ates offer a solution for the country &apos;s political and financial crisis .
un@@ rest in V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a has already gone on for months .
many have been in@@ ju@@ red and more than 100 people have been kill@@ ed .
V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a faced a financial crisis after the price of oil coll@@ ap@@ sed .
now , many cannot affor@@ d food or medic@@ ine .
the opposition is expected to organ@@ ise a prote@@ st on F@@ rid@@ ay when the new deleg@@ ates are to start in the constitu@@ ent ass@@ embly .

flo@@ od of certain types of tou@@ ris@@ ts threa@@ ten@@ s local culture
the authorities are considering lim@@ iting the number of tou@@ ris@@ ts in V@@ en@@ ice .
the local population is particularly en@@ ra@@ ged by tou@@ ris@@ ts tra@@ v@@ elling on cru@@ ise ships .
the Italian Minister of C@@ ul@@ tural Her@@ ita@@ ge and Ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and Tou@@ rism calls this &quot; e@@ at and fle@@ e &quot; tourism : tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers spen@@ d a few hours at a des@@ tin@@ ation , running through the major at@@ trac@@ tions as a large group .
V@@ en@@ ice is su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating under tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers pop@@ ping in the c@@ ity for a day .
it is difficult to move around in n@@ ar@@ row stre@@ ets and be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful s@@ quar@@ es are pac@@ ked with tou@@ ris@@ ts , lea@@ ving no room for those who live in V@@ en@@ ice .
they are forced to move f@@ ar@@ ther away from the historic centre , while hom@@ es have been re@@ placed by ho@@ tel@@ s .
the problems presented by tourism in V@@ en@@ ice are re@@ ported by The New Yor@@ k T@@ imes and The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
the authorities are considering lim@@ iting the number of tou@@ ris@@ ts .
they call the current phen@@ omen@@ on low@@ -@@ quality tourism .
&quot; when a large oc@@ ean lin@@ er arri@@ ves at port , you have two to three hours to see the c@@ ity .
you follow a fla@@ g@@ -@@ holding gu@@ ide from P@@ i@@ a@@ zz@@ ale R@@ oma to the Ri@@ al@@ to Br@@ id@@ ge and P@@ i@@ a@@ zz@@ a S@@ an Mar@@ co and then turn back , &quot; says D@@ ar@@ io Fran@@ c@@ es@@ ch@@ in@@ i , the Minister of C@@ ul@@ tural Her@@ ita@@ ge and Ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and Tou@@ rism , descri@@ b@@ ing the current problem@@ atic form of tourism .
&quot; the be@@ au@@ ty of Italian c@@ ities does not li@@ e only in ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture , but also in their loc@@ ation , sto@@ res and wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s .
we need to be able to preser@@ ve this part of the id@@ entity of our c@@ ities . &quot;
P@@ i@@ a@@ zz@@ a S@@ an Mar@@ co is one of the most pop@@ ular at@@ trac@@ tions in the historic centre of V@@ en@@ ice .
S@@ ain@@ t Mar@@ k &apos;s B@@ asi@@ lic@@ a is loc@@ ated by the pi@@ a@@ zz@@ a .
the local population is mainly ang@@ ered by cru@@ ise ships .
the historic centre of V@@ en@@ ice only has a local population of 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 .
in 19@@ 51 , its population was 17@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 .
in July , rou@@ gh@@ ly 2@@ ,@@ 000 V@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ ans prote@@ s@@ ted against mass tourism .
according to them , tourism reduc@@ es their quality of life , destro@@ ys the environment and dri@@ ves out the local population .
&quot; some 2@@ ,@@ 000 people move out every year .
if the same continues , there will be nothing but tou@@ ris@@ ts in V@@ en@@ ice .
this would be a social , an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ ical and histor@@ ical disaster , &quot; says Car@@ l@@ o Bel@@ fra@@ me , one of the organis@@ ers of the demonstra@@ tion .
this is a difficult situation , as cru@@ ise ships provide V@@ en@@ ice with b@@ ad@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ needed funds and jobs in various fields .
in addition to lim@@ iting the number of tou@@ ris@@ ts , one solution would be if cru@@ ise ships mo@@ o@@ red f@@ ar@@ ther away from the historic centre .
according to Lu@@ ci@@ an@@ o B@@ or@@ to@@ t who lives in V@@ en@@ ice , the situation would certainly change if the V@@ en@@ e@@ to , the administrative region where V@@ en@@ ice is loc@@ ated , had more power to decide on its own affairs , or bec@@ a@@ me fully autonom@@ ous even .
every year , V@@ en@@ ice is visi@@ ted by 20 to 30 million tou@@ ris@@ ts .

I@@ u@@ el was forced to make her S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at account private .
&quot; I received numerous ob@@ sc@@ ene p@@ ho@@ to@@ s from people I d@@ on &apos;@@ t know , and I had to make my account private , &quot; I@@ u@@ el said to V@@ G .
in her inter@@ view for V@@ G , I@@ u@@ el did not want to go into details regarding the p@@ ho@@ to@@ s she has received .
&quot; you can probably gu@@ ess , &quot; I@@ u@@ el said lau@@ gh@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s n@@ ice to get fe@@ ed@@ back after my run , but I can get along n@@ ic@@ ely without the other kind of attention . &quot;
I@@ u@@ el was bor@@ n in Denmark in 1994 .
her mo@@ ther is Danish and his fa@@ ther is Dan@@ is@@ h@@ -@@ Nor@@ we@@ gian .

foot in@@ jur@@ y threa@@ tened the whole care@@ er of s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ der J@@ ann@@ e K@@ or@@ p@@ i - now ready to ra@@ ce in the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships : &quot; it &apos;s n@@ ice when nothing h@@ ur@@ ts &quot;
it &apos;s been fu@@ n to s@@ no@@ w@@ board when nothing h@@ ur@@ ts !
J@@ ann@@ e K@@ or@@ p@@ i , 31 , one of the most successful s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ders in Fin@@ land , has once again been able to enjo@@ y the sport he lo@@ ves .
last sum@@ mer , his whole care@@ er was at risk .
a re@@ pet@@ itive stra@@ in in@@ jur@@ y to K@@ or@@ p@@ i &apos;s foot required sur@@ ger@@ y in January , and the foot took its time heal@@ ing .
K@@ or@@ p@@ i &apos;s has also h@@ ur@@ t his arm when rac@@ ing .
&quot; in sum@@ mer , I had no idea whether or not I would be able to continue my care@@ er .
my s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ship de@@ als en@@ ded and many things remain@@ ed und@@ ec@@ id@@ ed , &quot; K@@ or@@ p@@ i says .
&quot; but so they say that everything will be al@@ right in the end .
my foot got better , my s@@ pon@@ s@@ or extended our deal by two years and I wanted to get back on the s@@ lop@@ es .
after all this , it was an easy decision to continue my care@@ er .
I k@@ new it when I h@@ it the s@@ lop@@ es again .
I thought that , d@@ am@@ n , this sure is fu@@ n , let &apos;s continue for a cou@@ ple of se@@ as@@ ons . &quot;
K@@ or@@ p@@ i was able to r@@ ide properly in September and October , but being able to tra@@ in without any pain after a long break was a big thing .
K@@ or@@ p@@ i has only rac@@ ed a few times ,
but that is O@@ K .
ra@@ ces have never been that important in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding for K@@ or@@ p@@ i .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve never s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded for the sa@@ ke of any single competition .
it &apos;s f@@ r@@ ustra@@ ting to tra@@ in four years for a single competition , only to fall ill just before .
I d@@ on &apos;@@ t have that min@@ d@@ set , &quot; K@@ or@@ p@@ i says .
today , K@@ or@@ p@@ i will be rac@@ ing in the hal@@ f@@ pi@@ pe event of the World Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in S@@ ier@@ ra Ne@@ va@@ da , Spain .
even though individual compet@@ itions are not what at@@ trac@@ t K@@ or@@ p@@ i in s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding , he is always fi@@ red up and ready to ra@@ ce .
according to K@@ or@@ p@@ i , compet@@ itions held by the International s@@ ki F@@ eder@@ ation ( f@@ is ) have become more wid@@ ely accepted in recent years , even though some s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ders ch@@ ose to take part in the X@@ -@@ G@@ am@@ es that are held at the same time in Nor@@ way .
&quot; these are big ra@@ ces with a lot of ex@@ pos@@ ure round the world .
then again , I think that accep@@ tance always depen@@ ds on the conditions and level of each competition . &quot;
K@@ or@@ p@@ i is the ol@@ des@@ t a@@ th@@ l@@ ete in the 12@@ -@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ ete T@@ e@@ am Fin@@ land compet@@ ing in S@@ ier@@ ra Ne@@ va@@ da .
the youn@@ g@@ est members of the te@@ am , 17@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old R@@ ene R@@ in@@ ne@@ k@@ an@@ gas and E@@ m@@ mi Par@@ k@@ k@@ is@@ en@@ ni@@ em@@ i , are 14 years youn@@ ger than K@@ or@@ p@@ i .
&quot; it &apos;s fu@@ n to w@@ at@@ ch the youn@@ ger rid@@ ers .
I remember when I was that young that everything was new and I was ins@@ an@@ ely ex@@ ci@@ ted about everything .
this also gives me energy , &quot; K@@ or@@ p@@ i says .
&quot; I can just about keep up with them on the s@@ lop@@ es , but no@@ where else ; they are so full of energy ! &quot;
al@@ ong@@ side his s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding care@@ er , J@@ ann@@ e K@@ or@@ p@@ i has also been building another care@@ er in s@@ ports .
the son of leg@@ end@@ ary har@@ ness rac@@ er Pe@@ k@@ ka K@@ or@@ p@@ i is a f@@ an of har@@ ness rac@@ ing : he has his own rac@@ eh@@ or@@ ses that he prepar@@ es training plans for .
&quot; when I &apos;@@ m tra@@ v@@ elling all the time , there &apos;s no time to be more involved .
however , I try to at least chec@@ k the ra@@ ce results every day , even w@@ at@@ ch some ra@@ ces as well , &quot; K@@ or@@ p@@ i says .
according to K@@ or@@ p@@ i , har@@ ness rac@@ ing and co@@ ac@@ hing offer a potential care@@ er plan when his s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding care@@ er even@@ tually ends .
&quot; I d@@ on &apos;@@ t want to look that far ahead , but it &apos;s a possible option .
it fe@@ els like I &apos;@@ m stud@@ ying it al@@ ong@@ side s@@ no@@ w@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding .
I try to sta@@ y on top of things and improve myself , ma@@ y@@ be even take part in a few ra@@ ces in sum@@ mer .
if that becom@@ es my future prof@@ ession , it w@@ on &apos;@@ t be that hard to start if I already know a thing or two . &quot;
the E@@ l@@ it@@ lop@@ p@@ et cru@@ ise h@@ os@@ ted together with J@@ a@@ aj@@ o L@@ inn@@ on@@ ma@@ a is also part of har@@ ness rac@@ ing .
the two have le@@ ased a cru@@ ise ship for the E@@ l@@ it@@ lop@@ p@@ et event in Stock@@ hol@@ m at the end of May .
K@@ or@@ p@@ i and L@@ inn@@ on@@ ma@@ a decided to bring the ag@@ e@@ -@@ old tradition back to life .
&quot; we &apos;@@ ve already sol@@ d he@@ ap@@ s of cru@@ ise tic@@ ket@@ s , and there &apos;s been pl@@ enty of ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment about the event .
now we are at the point where at least we cannot go ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t .
there are still a few months to go , and we hope that we have a ship full of people , &quot; K@@ or@@ p@@ i says en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tically .

A@@ nne F@@ link , regional direc@@ tor of n@@ ur@@ sing services at A@@ t@@ ten@@ do , said that K@@ ite@@ e will have demand not only for op@@ tional services , but also for service h@@ ous@@ ing with 2@@ 4@@ -@@ h@@ our assistance .
&quot; all kin@@ ds of services are needed and , when there are op@@ tions , people also have the freedom of choice , &quot; F@@ link says .

G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land said the company had been sil@@ ent over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross sit@@ e .
more than 500 people work at the pl@@ ant , which produc@@ es H@@ ob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich te@@ a b@@ is@@ cu@@ its , among other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s ow@@ ner P@@ la@@ d@@ is said it had inves@@ ted more than £ 5@@ m at the sit@@ e in the last few years .
it added employees and union representatives &quot; will be the first to know &quot; if there were any changes to its operations .
in a letter to the company &apos;s sit@@ e manag@@ er , G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land called on Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s to &quot; address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modern@@ isation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B sen@@ i@@ or organis@@ er dre@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot get clar@@ ity from the general sit@@ e manag@@ er over the business needs and investment plan for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deep@@ ly concerning our members .
gener@@ ations of families have worked here and the work@@ force is highly concent@@ rated in the local community and the greater G@@ las@@ go@@ w area , a crucial pillar of dec@@ ent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priva@@ tion .
so , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosper@@ ity , and against the back@@ dro@@ p of B@@ re@@ x@@ it , ris@@ ing cost of living and ch@@ ron@@ ic manufac@@ turing dec@@ line , the e@@ ast end of G@@ las@@ go@@ w des@@ per@@ ately needs a th@@ ri@@ ving manufac@@ turing presence at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s . &quot;
a spo@@ kes@@ w@@ oman for P@@ la@@ d@@ is said : &quot; the sit@@ e manag@@ er at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land only yesterday and the company will be respon@@ ding directly as we value on@@ going eng@@ ag@@ ement with employees and union representatives .
we had a regula@@ r meeting with employees and G@@ M@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed open@@ ly .
we discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , we review our operations on an on@@ going basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and si@@ tes - in order to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years , we have inves@@ ted over £ 5@@ m in our T@@ oll@@ cross sit@@ e , no@@ tably on production lines and operational improvements .
we fully recognise the her@@ ita@@ ge of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufac@@ turing sit@@ e and should there be any changes to our operations at the sit@@ e , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . &quot;
did P@@ S@@ G war@@ n Barcelona about move for Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r three years ago ?
l@@ a L@@ ig@@ a side may r@@ ue their interest in Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti
Par@@ is S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ Ger@@ main will not let up in their pursu@@ it of Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r after lo@@ d@@ ging a £ 18@@ 9@@ m offer to tri@@ gg@@ er his rele@@ ase clause , but did they war@@ n Barcelona of the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ record ra@@ id three years ago ?
the sen@@ sa@@ tional approach has li@@ t up the sum@@ mer transfer w@@ in@@ do@@ w , with the Li@@ gue 1 c@@ lu@@ b ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark , which saw P@@ au@@ l P@@ og@@ b@@ a return to Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United last se@@ as@@ on for £ 8@@ 9@@ m .
once comple@@ ted , the move will see Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r become the world &apos;s most expen@@ sive pla@@ yer and also the hi@@ gh@@ es@@ t@@ -@@ paid professional s@@ por@@ t@@ sman in the world , with P@@ S@@ G offer@@ ing w@@ ages of over £ 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ week after tax .
Barcelona are known to be fu@@ ri@@ ous with the manner of the approach and the way that Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r has forced his way out , despite a source close to the Ca@@ tal@@ ans &apos; board ins@@ is@@ ting that the c@@ lu@@ b have always done their best to look after him since his arri@@ val from S@@ an@@ to@@ s in 20@@ 13 .
but was the foot@@ b@@ all world war@@ ned of this pros@@ pect three years ago by the P@@ S@@ G presid@@ ent ?
when Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter C@@ ity expressed an interest in sig@@ ning Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ id@@ i in 20@@ 14 , N@@ ass@@ er Al@@ -@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f@@ i had a ster@@ n war@@ ning for any c@@ lu@@ b looking to sign one of P@@ S@@ G &apos;s best pla@@ yers .
&quot; I am not wor@@ ried because they know that if they tou@@ ch one of our pla@@ yers , then we will be in opposition to them , we &apos;@@ l@@ l contact their pla@@ yers , &quot; Al@@ -@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f@@ i said .
&quot; we respect all c@@ lu@@ bs .
but if they try to sign one of our pla@@ yers , they &apos;@@ l@@ l face consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appear to have c@@ ros@@ sed this line , with the Spanish c@@ lu@@ b expres@@ sing an interesting in P@@ S@@ G mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti earlier this sum@@ mer .
P@@ S@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could well be feel@@ ing the re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions of that interest by los@@ ing one of their pri@@ z@@ e ass@@ ets in Ne@@ y@@ ma@@ r .
